Active CRS community flood insurance premium rates are discounted to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from the community\u2019s efforts that address the three goals of the program: 1. Reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable property; 2. Strengthen and support the insurance aspects of the National Flood Insurance Program; and 3. Foster comprehensive floodplain management.  rnrnThe Flood insurance premium rates in Community Rating System communities are discounted in increments of 5%. A Class 10 community is not participating in the CRS and receives no discount. A Class 9 community receives a 5% discount for all policies in its Special Flood Hazard Areas, a Class 8 community receives a 10% discount, all the way to a Class 1 community, which receives a 45% premium discount. Classifications are based on 19 creditable activities, organized in four categories: Public Information, Mapping and Regulations, Flood Damage Reduction, Warning and Response.  Quantitative CRS datasets are avaialble about community floodplain mangament practices that validates the CRS community rating classifications and credit points. The abridged public dataset is available at https://www.fema.gov/floodplain-management/community-rating-system.  CRS dataset is updated semiannually in CIS.",

The SEAP includes a web-based multi-rater assessment process to collect feedback from the SES CDP candidate, as well as his/her boss, peers and direct reports. Data is collected via an online assessment tool using raters names and DHS email addresses, which would be provided in advance by SES CDP candidates to program administrators. PII data required for survey deployment is limited to names, email addresses and the category of relationship between the program candidate and the rater (Boss, Peer, Direct Report, Other). When assessment results are reviewed with the SES CDP candidate, this is generally delivered in a one-on-one feedback session between the participant and an assigned vendor coach/observer.",

This tool will allow each enrollee to apply electronically and receive approval from their supervisor using the email account system. The system has a backend reporting tool which provides the parking and transit program managers access to maintaining electronic folders and ad hoc reporting functionality. This system will eliminate the manual processing of over 200 applications monthly. It will also eliminate the manual validation of over 2,500 headquarters participants.",

Core data elements include number of applicants, county, zip code, and severity of damage, with individual data elements and descriptions listed in the metadata information within the dataset. rnData is self-reported and subject to human error. For example, when an applicant registers online, they enter their street and city address. The system runs a check and suggests a county. The applicant can override that choice. Similarly, with a call center registration, the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives are instructed to ask what county they live in. An applicant has the right to choose the county.rnThe financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and application of business rules, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal reporting.rnTo learn more about disaster assistance please visit https://www.fema.gov/individual-disaster-assistance.rnCitation: The Agency\u2019s preferred citation for datasets (API usage or file downloads) can be found on the OpenFEMA Terms and Conditions page, Citing Data section: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions.rnIf you have media inquiries about this dataset, please email the FEMA News Desk FEMA-News-Desk@fema.dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

Core data elements include number of applicants, county, zip code, inspections, severity of damage, and assistance provided. Individual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.rnData is self-reported and subject to human error. For example, when an applicant registers online, they enter their street and city address. The system runs a check and suggests a county. The applicant can override that choice. Similarly, with a call center registration, the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives are instructed to ask what county they live in. An applicant has the right to choose the county.

Organized and managed by FEMA, the system supports alert origination by Federal, state, local, territorial and tribal officials, and subsequent dissemination to the public using a range of national and local alerting systems. This dataset contains recent*, historic, and archived IPAWS Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) v1.2 messages from June 2012 to the present including date, time, event code (examples listed below), city, county, joint agency, police, law enforcement, Collaborative Operating Group (COG), State(s), locality, territory or tribe. It can be used to capture and analyze historic and archived messages. *The dataset is published with a twenty-four (24) hour delay to reduce the risk of being confused with an active alert received from the live IPAWS feed. The most recent record will reflect the alert(s) sent twenty-four (24) hours ago (if such records exist). For example, if an alert originator sent an alert at 1459GMT on June 1st and sent a different alert at 1600GMT on June 2nd, these alerts will not be visible in the dataset until 1459GMT on June 2nd and 1600GMT June 3rd respectively. Information on signing up for receiving active alerts can be found at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system . To request access to alerts issued through IPAWS or for a list of companies with access to the IPAWS All-Hazards Information Feed, email ipaws@fema.dhs.gov. The data elements within the CAP messages are well documented and can be found in the following technical document: https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.pdf See also: IPAWS Architecture - https://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/ipaws/architecture_diagram.pdf IPAWS Overview - https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system This is raw, unedited data with no personally identifiable information from the IPAWS Alert Aggregator from June 2012 to the present created by over 1450 Alert Originators across the country. FEMA does not validate the content of each message. As such, it may contain a small percentage of human error. OpenFEMA does not have a full backup capability so if the site goes down, the information will be inaccessible. This is a rare occurrence. Earlier messages may contain non-compliant geocoordinates. Recent versions of the software check these coordinates for compliance. This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report and should not be considered an official federal report. If you are using this site for other than research purposes, please understand that these CAP messages are captured only after the official IPAWS message has been sent. Note that the original IPAWS CAP message is provided in the originalMessage element of the returned JSON object. The XML based message is encoded such that a separate tool, such as a JSON parser, computer language, or browser must be used to view the original format. See the originalMessage field description for additional details. Due to its size and its hierarchical data structure, working with the IPAWS Archived Alerts file can be challenging. See the OpenFEMA Guide to Working with Large Data Sets page for useful hints and tips: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/working-with-large-data-sets .

The MPP is an online platform for tracking and reporting on mitigation plans and related data elements across all ten Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Regions. MPP data provides insight into which jurisdictions are participating in mitigation plans across the country and what the status of those plans are. Additionally, MPP data provides dates to support tracking of when plans are approved and when they are set to expire which FEMA uses to monitor and support disaster preparedness and resilience.rnHazard mitigation planning reduces loss of life and property by minimizing the impact of disasters. It begins with state, tribal, territorial and local governments identifying natural disaster risks and vulnerabilities that are common in their area. After identifying these risks, they develop long-term strategies for protecting people and property from similar events. Mitigation plans are key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage and reconstruction. When applying for certain types of non-emergency disaster assistance, FEMA requires a hazard mitigation plan. These requirements are part of the laws, regulations and policy surrounding hazard mitigation planning.

The location is represented by county, city, and zip code. This dataset contains Individual Assistance (IA) applications from DR1439 (declared in 2002) to those declared over 30 days ago. The full data set is refreshed on an annual basis and refreshed weekly to update disasters declared in the last 18 months. This dataset includes all major disasters and includes only valid registrants (applied in a declared county, within the registration period, having damage due to the incident and damage within the incident period). Information about individual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.rnValid registrants may be eligible for IA assistance, which is intended to meet basic needs and supplement disaster recovery efforts. IA assistance is not intended to return disaster-damaged property to its pre-disaster condition. Disaster damage to secondary or vacation homes does not qualify for IHP assistance.rnData comes from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) with raw, unedited, self-reported content and subject to a small percentage of human error.rnAny financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and application of business rules, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov.

This is done on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair, replacement, or mitigation work for facilities damaged by the disaster event. rnrnAs part of Congressional bill HR 152 - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, FEMA is providing the following information for our stakeholders: Region, Disaster Declaration Number, Disaster Type, State, Applicant, County, Damage Category Code, Federal Share Obligated, and Date Obligated.rnrnNote: FEMA obligates funding for a project directly to the Recipient (State or Tribe). It is the Recipient's responsibility to ensure that the eligible subrecipient (listed in the dataset as Applicant Name) receives the award funding.rnrnThis dataset lists details about project versions (occurring when the scope/cost changes for a project). Versions adjust the cost of the project  with positive additions called obligations and subtractions called deobligations. Combined, they reconcile to reflect the Total Federal Share Obligation, but reconciliation occurs over the life of the project - sometimes years after the declaration date. The dataset represents project obligations within a seven-day period prior to the listed date but does not include obligations uploaded on the same day as the publication. Open projects still under pre-obligation processing are not represented.

The financial information is derived from EMMIE and not FEMA's official financial systems. Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov.

Location information is derived from reported address, geocoding of that address, and reported NFIP community. Because NFIP insurance claims data spans the history of the NFIP, many of the structures have poor address information resulting in poor or missing coordinates and additional location fields that rely on those coordinates. An effort has been made to fill in missing data and resolve conflicts between state, county, community, and census block group. Because of this effort, emstatistics derived from this data may differ from those reported elsewhere by FEMA or others/em.rnThere is a lot of interest in this data as it touches many program areas of the NFIP and serves as an indicator of flood risk and mitigation need.rnrnFEMA's terms and conditions and citation requirements for datasets (API usage or file downloads) can be found on the OpenFEMA Terms and Conditions page: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions.rnrnFor answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the OpenFEMA program, API, and publicly available datasets, please visit: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/faq.rnrnIf you have media inquiries about this dataset, please email the FEMA News Desk at FEMA-News-Desk@fema.dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards, and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The EMPG, from FY 2016 to the present FY,provides federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The Federal Government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system. rnrnThe EMPG is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the NPG\u2019s. Examples include: rnrn\u2022 Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA)process.rn\u2022 Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structure.rn\u2022 Updating and approving specific emergency plans.rn\u2022 Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA.rn\u2022 Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities.rn\u2022 Initiating or achieving a whole community approach to security and emergency management. rnrnThis dataset was first made public on 10/31/2016 and will be updated twice a year. rnrnFor additional details on the EMPG program visit: https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/emergency-management-performance.rnrnThis dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should not be considered an official federal report. rn rnCitation: The Agency\u2019s preferred citation for datasets (API usage or file downloads) can be found on the OpenFEMA Terms and Conditions page, Citing Data section: https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/terms-conditions.rnrnIf you have media inquiries about this dataset, please email the FEMA News Desk at FEMA-News-Desk@fema.dhs.gov or call (202) 646-3272.

In response to the memorandum, DHS developed a DHS Public Access Plan, and intends to make available to the public digitally formatted scientific data that support the conclusions in peer-reviewed scholarly publications that are the results of DHS R&D funding. This data repository site with a customized DHS Storefront allows DHS to post releasable scientific digital data from peer-reviewed publications resulting from DHS-funded research. The data repository is configured to allow DHS users (and publishers acting on behalf of these users) to deposit data sets into the repository, making them available to the general public.",

Operation ORION aligns with the goals and strategies set forth in the Strategy for Combating Illicit Opioids, allowing HSI to leverage its vast administrative, civil, and criminal law enforcement authorities to counter fentanyl and fentanyl-related substance distribution. Under the operation, HSI continued to increase the number of Border Enforcement Security Task Forces (BESTs), Fentanyl Abatement and Suppression Teams, and Fentanyl Overdose Resolution Teams in strategic locations to support HSI\u2019s nationwide fentanyl and fentanyl-related substance supply reduction strategy.
