The VETS\u2019 Case Management System (VCMS) allows USERRA claimants to submit claims to VETS involving potential USERRA and Veterans Preference violations.  Claimants may also monitor the status of their claim, request withdrawal and referral actions, and upload evidence and other documents directly to their assigned investigator through the VCMS.  VETS\u2019 investigators use the VCMS as the case file of record to conduct investigations based on the claims submitted by claimants.  The VCMS maintains secure copies of all investigative files, and case elements, and produces data regarding investigations for formal reporting requirements. This system contains 100 relational tables.\n\nDOL-VETS produce annual and quarterly Reports to Congress on USERRA. The source data for those reports are run using SQL, and we keep the data pulls in a secure SharePoint site for audit purposes.  Those \"\"official\"\" data pulls are done quarterly on the 1st of the month after the end of the quarter.\"\n\nThe VCMS was put into production on April 1, 2020 and fully replaced all paper and other electronic USERRA case management systems and processes for newly filed claims. The VCMS is entirely electronic, and incorporates all aspects of the investigative and referral processes, making case investigations more efficient and fungible. The VCMS will continue to be updated and improved to create greater efficiency and effectiveness during the upcoming five years (starting in FY 2020).",

Two new performance measures target the timeliness of the Employer's First Report of Injury and the First Payment of Compensation, thereby improving initial claims processing and benefit delivery outcomes. The \"First Report of Injury\" measure tracks the time from the date of the injury or death, or the date of the employer's knowledge of the injury and the onset of disability, whichever is later, to the date the Longshore District Office receives the Employer's First Report of Injury (Form LS-202). The \"First Payment\" measure tracks the time it takes the employer or insurance carrier to issue the First Payment of Compensation after the worker becomes disabled for work or after the worker's death.  Performance targets aim to increase the percentage of cases in which employers submit their First Reports of Injury and employers and carriers issue the First Payments of Compensation within 30 days. Performance results are shown in the tables below. The DBA performance measures were introduced in 2010, and the non-DBA measures in 2011.",

The evaluation included 75 existing YouthBuild programs who received funding from DOL or the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2011. The evaluation included an impact analysis (with 72 sites), process study (all 75), and a cost analysis (58 sites).  Overall, the impact study includes 3,929 sample members. Three sites were unable to contribute sample members to the impact study; among the remaining sites, the study sample size varied considerably from 250 to 9. (Twenty-three sites have 25 or fewer study participants.) The main impact analysis drew on three waves of survey data and two administrative records sources and pooled data across all sites. A program features analysis used the extensive implementation research data to investigate how impacts might vary based on site-level characteristics.",

Focusing on participants who entered WIA programs between July 2003 and June 2005, the evaluation considers the impact for all those in the program, the impact for those receiving only Core or Intensive Services, and the incremental impact of Training Services. This dataset contains all of the information used to conduct the non-experimental evaluation estimates for the 1) WIA Client Treatment Group and 2) The Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Client comparison group. The administrative data collected by IMPAQ for the \"Workforce Investment Act Non-Experimental Net Impact Evaluation\" project were received from state agencies in three segments: annual Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) or closely related files, Unemployment Insurance data, and Unemployment Insurance Wage Record data. The analysis were conducted for twelve states; however, based on the data sharing agreements, the Public Use Data (PUD) set includes data for nine states only. Our agreement for use of these data required that the identity of those states was not revealed. As a result, all geographical identifiers were removed to preserve states' anonymity.",

The grants ended in December 2012 and December 2015, respectively. As part of the YPD, grantees were required to implement a differential experimental research design whereby treatment group members received an additional level of service above and beyond the base level of services provided to the control group. The treatment interventions varied across grantees, with some providing mentoring services and others providing guided employment, education, training and related supports. More than 3,700 young parents and expectant parents were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.",

With few exceptions (e.g., veterans), all eligible adults and dislocated workers in the LWIAs were randomly assigned to one of three research groups defined by the WIA-funded services that they could receive: (1) all WIA services, including training, (2) core and intensive services but not training, and (3) core services but not intensive or training services. Random assignment took place just after customers were found eligible to receive WIA-funded intensive services.",

Also, it was designed to understand the relationship and flow of participants as they go through the public workforce system. The PWSD can be used to analyze these programs both individually and in combination. The PWSD contains economic variables, Unemployment Insurance System data, and data on programs funded by the Workforce Investment Act and Employment Service. Economic variables included are labor force, employment, unemployment, unemployment rate, and gross domestic product data.",

They also help participants address personal issues that impede their ability to work and assist them in finding unsubsidized jobs when the transitional jobs end. Prior studies of transitional jobs programs have shown mixed results. ETJD tested seven employment programs serving unemployed noncustodial parents or individuals recently released from prison. Although all of the programs were based on the same basic model, each program incorporated different enhancements to address the shortcomings of previously evaluated programs, with the goal of improving outcomes across a range of domains, including employment, criminal justice involvement, child support, and economic and personal well-being. There was a total of 7,000 sample members, roughly 1,000 per site. Impact analyses were conducted at both the pooled and site levels.",

Prices are median yearly prices for one child at the market rate. School-age prices reflect the school-year arrangement (part day). Childcare prices are based on the 2019-2022 data collection cycle  and are presented in 2022 real dollars using the CPI-U for child care (day care and preschool in the U.S. city average). \nNDCP data are intended to be used at the county level; caution is advised when using state averages. State averages are created by weighting county childcare price estimates by county population for counties with available childcare price data. Some states have more missing data than others which could impact the estimated state averages. \nAs a result, state averages may not meet the higher quality standards developed for the NDCP county-level estimates.
