The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

The ACS-ED provides a rich collection of social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics for school systems, school-age children, and the parents of school-age children. In addition to focusing on school-age children, the ACS-ED provides enrollment iterations for children enrolled in public school. The data profiles include percentages (along with associated margins of error) that allow for comparison of school district-level conditions across the U.S. For more information about the NCES ACS-ED collection, visit the NCES Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program at: </span><a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS' style='color:rgb(0, 121, 193); text-decoration-line:none; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Demographic/ACS</a><div><br /></div><div><div style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'>Annotation values are negative value representations of estimates and have values when non-integer information needs to be represented.

More information about the program is available at <https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/resource/index.html>. NRS 2017-18 is a cross-sectional data collection that is designed to monitor performance accountability for the federally funded, state-administered adult education program.

The study was conducted using surveys of LEAs and the schools in the LEAs. LEAs and BOCES-type regional education centers functioning as LEAs were sampled. Prior to 2011-12, charter schools were primarily sampled if they were part of a LEA, not if they were a separate charter school district. For CRDC 2004, the response rates, including partial respondents to the data collection, were approximately 97% of all LEAs (95% of all LEAs responded completely with clean data-which is consistent with the 2002 Elementary and Secondary Survey), and 97% of all schools (94% of all schools responded completely with clean data). Key statistics produced from CRDC 2004 can provide information about critical civil rights issues as well as contextual information on the state of civil rights in the nation, including enrollment demographics, advanced placement, discipline, and special education services.",

F-33 2013-14 (https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/f33ageninfo.asp) is a universe survey that is designed to provide finance data for all local education agencies (LEAs) that provide free public elementary and secondary education in the United States. The data file for F-33 2013-14 contains records representing the public elementary and secondary education agencies in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. Key statistics produced from F-33 2013-14 are expenditures by object and function, indebtedness, and revenues by source. The F-33 is a collaboration by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the U.S. Census Bureau (Census). Census is the primary collection agent. Census refers to the collection as the 'Annual Survey of Local Government Finances: School Systems' and releases its own version of the data file and publication based on that file. The NCES and Census files differ in their inclusion of independent charter school districts, the classification of some revenue items, and the inclusion of some expenditure items.",

EDFacts ASSMT:2012-13 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about students participation in and performance on academic assessments in Reading/Language Arts, Science, and Mathematics in elementary and secondary education at the school, LEA, and SEA levels. EDFacts ASSMT:2012-13 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal, and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts ASSMT:2012-13 are from eight (8) data groups with information on Academic Achievement, Academic Achievement-Flexibility, Assessment Participation, and Assessment Participation-Flexibility in Mathematics and Reading/Language Arts. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as 'variables', as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts data",

ECLS-B (https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/birth.asp) is a longitudinal study that is designed to provide policy makers, researchers, child care providers, teachers, and parents with detailed information about children's early life experiences. The study was conducted using multiple data collection methods (computer-assisted in-person interviews, computer-assisted telephone interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and direct observation) to collect information about children's characteristics, behaviors, development, and experiences from the adults who were important in the children's lives, including mothers, fathers, early care and education providers, and teachers. Direct child assessments were used to measure children's development, knowledge, and skills from the time the children were about 9 months old. A nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in the U.S. in 2001 was fielded. Key statistics produced from ECLS-B focus on children's health, development, care, and education during the formative years from birth through kindergarten entry.",

EDFacts ASSMT:2010-11 (ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts) annually collects cross-sectional data from states about students' participation in and performance on academic assessments in Reading/Language Arts, Science, and Mathematics in elementary and secondary education at the school, LEA, and SEA levels. EDFacts ASSMT:2010-11 data were collected using the EDFacts Submission System (ESS), a centralized portal, and their submission by states is mandatory and required for benefits. Not submitting the required reports by a state constitutes a failure to comply with law and may have consequences for federal funding to the state. Key statistics produced from EDFacts ASSMT:2010-11 are from 12 data groups with information on Academic Achievement, Academic Achievement-Flexibility, Assessment Participation, and Assessment Participation-Flexibility in Mathematics, Reading/Language Arts, and Science. For the purposes of this system, data groups are referred to as 'variables', as a result of the structure and format of EDFacts' data.",
