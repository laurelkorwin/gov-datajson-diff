Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reordering of JSON object properties within dataset entries
- Consistent alphabetical ordering of properties being applied
- No significant content changes - mostly structural reorganization
- Properties being moved but values remaining the same

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No systematic replacements of terms or phrases
- No consistent additions or removals of specific terminology
- Descriptions and references remain unchanged
- Property names remain consistent (e.g., "accessLevel", "identifier", "title", etc.)

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within each dataset object are being reordered alphabetically
- Common pattern of moving properties to follow this order:
  1. @type
  2. accessLevel
  3. accrualPeriodicity
  4. bureauCode
  5. contactPoint
  6. description
  7. identifier
  8. keyword
  etc.
- Nested objects (like publisher and contactPoint) maintain their internal structure
- Array elements remain in their original order
- The overall hierarchy and nesting of the JSON structure remains unchanged

The primary change appears to be a standardization of property ordering within dataset objects, likely for consistency and maintainability purposes. This is a structural change that doesn't affect the actual content or meaning of the data.
