Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reordering of JSON fields within dataset objects
- Consistent restructuring of metadata entries
- Addition of new fields and values in some entries
- Standardization of field ordering across multiple dataset entries

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent field ordering pattern applied across entries:
  * accessLevel
  * accrualPeriodicity
  * bureauCode
  * contactPoint
  * describedBy/description
  * identifier
  * keyword
  * landingPage
  * language
  * modified
  * programCode
  * publisher
  * rights
  * title

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Fields within each dataset entry are now consistently ordered alphabetically
- Publisher information is consistently moved to the end of each entry
- Contact information formatting is standardized
- Array elements (like keywords, bureauCodes) follow consistent formatting
- Distribution information blocks are formatted consistently when present
- Spatial and theme information moved to end of entries when present

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and formatting of the dataset entries rather than changing their content. This type of reorganization suggests an effort to improve consistency and maintainability of the data catalog.
