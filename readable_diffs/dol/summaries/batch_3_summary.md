Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Significant reorganization of dataset entries
- Reordering of metadata fields within dataset entries
- No substantial content changes to the actual data or descriptions
- Consistent alphabetical reordering of properties within each dataset object

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No systematic changes in terminology or vocabulary
- Descriptions, titles and field names remain consistent
- No new standardized terms introduced
- No terms systematically removed or replaced

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Major restructuring of the JSON format:
  - Properties within each dataset object are now alphabetically ordered
  - Dataset entries appear to be reordered but maintain their relationships
  - Consistent formatting applied across all entries
- Field ordering is now standardized across all dataset entries:
  - accessLevel appears first
  - followed by accrualPeriodicity
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - etc.
- No changes to the actual data model or schema
- Maintains same overall structure but with improved organization

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the format and organization of the data rather than modifying any actual content. This looks like a cleanup/reformatting effort to improve consistency and readability of the JSON structure.
