Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON structure with consistent property ordering
- Standardization of dataset entries
- Properties within each dataset are now alphabetically ordered
- Removal of redundant or inconsistent formatting

2. Terminology Patterns:
Consistent Replacements:
- No major terminology changes, but standardization of how properties are organized
- Property names remain the same but are reordered consistently

Systematic Additions/Removals:
- Removed inconsistent whitespace and formatting
- Standardized property ordering across all dataset entries

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- All dataset entries now follow a consistent property order:
  - @type first
  - accessLevel near the beginning
  - Core metadata (description, identifier, etc.) grouped together
  - Contact information grouped together
  - Distribution information grouped together
  - Keywords and codes grouped together
  - Publisher information grouped together
  - Rights and license information grouped together

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and formatting of the JSON document rather than changing the actual content. This type of reorganization improves readability and maintainability while making it easier to programmatically process the data.

The most significant change is the consistent ordering of properties within each dataset object, which makes the document more predictable and easier to maintain. The actual data content remains largely unchanged.
