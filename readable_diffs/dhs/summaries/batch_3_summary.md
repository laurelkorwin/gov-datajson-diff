- Modifications to bureau codes and access levels

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:

Terms Added/Removed:

    "hasEmail": "mailto:edmo@hq.dhs.gov"
}
```

Concept Description Changes:
- More structured approach to describing access levels ("public", "non-public", "restricted public")
- Standardized format for bureau codes (e.g., "024:056", "024:070")

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Consistent ordering of fields within each entry:
  1. accessLevel
  2. bureauCode
  3. contactPoint
  4. description
  5. distribution
  6. identifier
  7. keyword
  8. license
  9. modified
  10. programCode
  11. publisher
  12. rights
  13. title

- More consistent JSON formatting with proper nesting and indentation
- Standardization of array and object structures
- Better organization of related fields (e.g., grouping all identifier-related fields together)

The changes appear focused on improving consistency, standardization, and maintainability of the data structure while preserving the core content.
