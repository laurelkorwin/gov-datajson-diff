Total tokens in batch: 34990

Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reorganization of metadata entries for various DHS systems and resources
- Consistent restructuring of JSON-like data objects
- Addition of standardized fields across entries
- Reordering of fields within each entry to follow a consistent pattern

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Field Ordering:
- Fields are consistently reordered to follow this pattern:
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - identifier
  - keyword
  - license
  - modified
  - programCode
  - publisher
  - rights
  - title

Field Standardization:
- All entries now include standardized fields like:
  - license: "https://www.usa.gov/government-works"
  - programCode: ["024:000"]
  - rights: null
  - contactPoint with consistent format

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:

- Each entry is now structured as a complete, self-contained object
- Consistent formatting and indentation throughout
- Fields are grouped logically:
  - Administrative metadata (accessLevel, bureauCode) at top
  - Content metadata (description, keywords) in middle
  - Technical metadata (license, programCode) at bottom
- Contact information is standardized across all entries
- Distribution information, when present, follows a consistent format

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize metadata formatting and ensure consistency across all entries in the system. The modifications focus on structural organization rather than content changes, suggesting this is primarily a technical restructuring rather than a content update.
