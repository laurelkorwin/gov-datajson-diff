Based on the git diff changes provided, here is my analysis:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Major restructuring of JSON data format
- Reordering of properties within dataset objects
- Standardization of property ordering across multiple entries
- No significant content changes to the actual data values

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No consistent terminology changes observed
- No systematic additions or removals of terms
- No changes in how concepts are described or referenced
- Existing terminology and descriptions remain unchanged

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within each dataset object are now consistently ordered:
  * accessLevel
  * bureauCode
  * contactPoint
  * description
  * distribution
  * identifier
  * keyword
  * license
  * modified
  * programCode
  * publisher
  * rights
  * title
- The change appears to be primarily about standardizing the JSON structure rather than modifying content
- Each dataset entry now follows the same strict property ordering pattern
- The overall organization is more consistent and predictable

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and format of the JSON data, rather than modifying any actual content or terminology. This type of restructuring often helps with data consistency, readability, and processing efficiency.
