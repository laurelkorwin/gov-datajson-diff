1. Key Changes Summary:
- Multiple dataset entries have been restructured to follow a consistent JSON format

- The organization of fields has been standardized across entries

2. Terminology Patterns:

- Bureau codes are being standardized (mostly to "024:070")
- Contact information is being standardized to use consistent email addresses

Added Terms:

Modified Descriptions:

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- JSON structure has been standardized across all entries with consistent field ordering:
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - distribution
  - identifier
  - keyword
  - license
  - modified
  - programCode
  - publisher
  - rights
  - title

- Contact information has been moved to a consistent location in each entry
- Distribution URLs are now consistently formatted

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the format and structure of dataset metadata while updating various endpoints and contact information.
