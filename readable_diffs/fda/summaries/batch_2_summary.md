Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reordering of metadata fields within dataset entries
- Consistent reformatting of distribution information
- Movement of "landingPage" field position within entries
- No substantive content changes - mainly structural reorganization

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No consistent terminology changes or replacements
- All technical terms (e.g., "mediaType", "downloadURL", "accessURL") remain the same
- File format specifications ("Excel", "application/vnd.ms-excel") are unchanged
- Dataset titles and descriptions remain identical

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Distribution block properties are consistently reordered to:
  * accessURL
  * downloadURL
  * format
  * mediaType
- "landingPage" field is consistently moved to appear before "modified" field
- Property ordering is standardized across all dataset entries
- The overall structure maintains JSON format but with more consistent field ordering

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and ordering of metadata fields rather than changing any actual content or terminology. This suggests an effort to improve consistency in the data format while preserving all original information.
