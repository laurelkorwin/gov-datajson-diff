Based on the git diff changes, here's my analysis:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties to maintain consistent alphabetical ordering
- Addition of "accrualPeriodicity" field to multiple dataset entries
- Standardization of distribution object structure
- Removal of trailing properties and consolidation of metadata fields

2. Terminology Patterns:
Consistent Replacements:
- No direct word/phrase replacements, but standardization of property ordering
- Properties like "landingPage" and "accrualPeriodicity" are systematically moved to consistent positions

Added Terms:
- "accrualPeriodicity" added to multiple dataset entries
- Values like "R/P1W", "R/P1Y", "irregular" added for periodic updates

Removed/Relocated:
- "describedBy" and "temporal" fields moved to standardized positions
- Standalone "landingPage" entries consolidated into the main property structure

3. Structural Changes:
- Distribution object properties reordered consistently:
  ```json
  {
    "accessURL": "...",
    "downloadURL": "...",
    "format": "...",
    "mediaType": "..."
  }
  ```
- Dataset properties now follow consistent ordering:
  - Core metadata (accessLevel, accrualPeriodicity, etc.)
  - Distribution information
  - Identifiers and keywords
  - References and temporal data
  - Title information

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and organization of the JSON data rather than changing the actual content or terminology used in the datasets.
