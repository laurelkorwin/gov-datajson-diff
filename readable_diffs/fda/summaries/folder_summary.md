Based on the provided batch summaries, here's a comprehensive analysis of the git diff changes in the FDA folder:

Key Themes and Patterns:

1. Structural Standardization
- Systematic reordering of JSON properties to maintain alphabetical consistency
- Uniform organization of distribution object properties
- Standardized positioning of common fields like "landingPage" and "temporal"
- No content modifications - changes are purely organizational

2. Metadata Enhancement
- Addition of "accrualPeriodicity" field across multiple datasets
- New periodic update values introduced:
  * R/P1W (weekly)
  * R/P1Y (yearly)
  * irregular
- Consolidation of metadata fields for improved consistency

Terminology and Language:

1. Consistency Maintenance
- No substantive terminology changes or replacements
- Technical terms preserved:
  * mediaType
  * downloadURL
  * accessURL
- File format specifications remained unchanged
- Dataset titles and descriptions maintained

2. Property Structure Standardization
Distribution object properties consistently ordered as:
```json
{
  "accessURL": "...",
  "downloadURL": "...",
  "format": "...",
  "mediaType": "..."
}
```

Structural Modifications:

1. Field Reorganization
- Core metadata fields grouped together
- Distribution information standardized
- Identifiers and keywords consolidated
- References and temporal data positioned consistently
- Title information placement standardized

2. Property Consolidation
- Standalone fields merged into main property structure
- "describedBy" and "temporal" fields repositioned
- "landingPage" entries integrated into standardized structure

The changes reflect a systematic effort to improve data organization and consistency without altering the underlying content or meaning of the datasets.
