Format: The CMAQ model output datasets used for the analysis presented in this manuscript and documented here were provided by scientists in EPA/ORD/CEMM and EPA/OAR/OAQPS. \r\n\r\nThe EPA/ORD/CEMM-contributed dataset consisted of hourly CMAQ output for all model species from a 2017 simulation over the northern hemisphere along a boundary curtain of a 36 km modeling domain specified over the CONUS. The horizontal and vertical extent of the 36 km modeling domain was specified by the external collaborator and was defined by 524 boundary grid cells and 34 vertical layers. The number of output species from the 2017 hemispheric CMAQ simulation was 191 through to September 23, 2017 and 213 starting September 24, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe EPA/OAR/OAQPS-contributed dataset consistent of hourly gridded CMAQ output for surface ozone concentrations from four model simulations for the year 2016. Two of these simulations were performed over the northern hemisphere at a horizontal resolution of 108 km and the other two simulations were performed over the CONUS at a horizontal resolution of 12 km.\r\n\r\nThe data files with the CMAQ model output provided to the external researchers use the ioapi/netcdf format. Documentation of this format, including definitions of the geographical projection attributes contained in the file headers, are available at https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSkipper, T.N., Y.

Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. The data in this data set provides the Feddema Moisture Index, classified climate class, and classified season class for each time decade and 30 yr normal period from 1900-2010 and the 10 analyzed climate model projections described in the manuscript.\n",

LCIA methods are collections of characterization factors, which are measures of relative potency or potential impact, for a given flow (e.g., NH3 to air) for a set of impact categories (e.g., acidification), provided in units of potency or impact equivalents per unit mass of the flowable associated with a given context (e.g., 1.88 kg SO2 eq/kg NH3 emitted to air). LCIA methods are typically used along with life cycle inventory data to estimate potential impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA). ReCiPe2016 produces 18 midpoint indicators and 3 endpoint indicators, and both midpoint and endpoint are provided using Individualist (I), Hierarchist (H), and Egalitarian (E) cultural perspectives. \n\nThe FEDEFL or Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List (EPA 2019) is the standardized elementary flow list for use with data meeting the US Federal LCA Commons data guidelines.\n\nIn this dataset, ReCiPe2016 is applied to FEDEFL v1.0.7 flows. This dataset was created by the LCIA Formatter v1.0 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter). The LCIA Formatter is a tool for providing standardized life cycle impact assessment methods with characterization factors transparently applied to flows from an authoritative flow list, like the FEDEFL. The LCIA Formatter draws from the original ReCiPe2016 source file and the ReCiPe2016 to FEDEFL flow mapping. The LCIA formatter accesses this mapping file through the fedelemflowlist tool available at https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List.

LCIA methods are collections of characterization factors, which are measures of relative potency or potential impact, for a given flow (e.g., NH3 to air) for a set of impact categories (e.g., acidification), provided in units of potency or impact equivalents per unit mass of the flowable associated with a given context (e.g., 1.88 kg SO2 eq/kg NH3 emitted to air). LCIA methods are typically used along with life cycle inventory data to estimate potential impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA). ReCiPe2016 produces 18 midpoint indicators and 3 endpoint indicators, and both midpoint and endpoint are provided using Individualist (I), Hierarchist (H), and Egalitarian (E) cultural perspectives. \n\nThe FEDEFL or Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List (EPA 2019) is the standardized elementary flow list for use with data meeting the US Federal LCA Commons data guidelines.\n\nIn this dataset, ReCiPe2016 is applied to FEDEFL v1.0.7 flows. This dataset was created by the LCIA Formatter v1.0 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter). The LCIA Formatter is a tool for providing standardized life cycle impact assessment methods with characterization factors transparently applied to flows from an authoritative flow list, like the FEDEFL. The LCIA Formatter draws from the original ReCiPe2016 source file and the ReCiPe2016 to FEDEFL flow mapping. The LCIA formatter accesses this mapping file through the fedelemflowlist tool available at https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List. This mapping file and a note about the mapping are provided separately. Where a flow context is less specific in the FEDEFL (e.g., air) relative to the ReCiPe2016 flow contexts (e.g., air/rural), the LCIA Formatter applies the average of the relevant characterization factors from ReCiPe2016 to the FEDEFL flow. \n\nThe zip files are compressed archives of JSON files following the openLCA schema at https://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema.

This uses the model configuration file, which can be found @ https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/blob/v0.4/inst/extdata/modelspecs/USEEIOv2.0.yml. The resulting model was exported using the writeModeltoXLSX() function to create this dataset. The waste disaggregation data are required for model building and also embedded in the useeiorv0.4. The generateModelIdentifier() function was used on the same model create the model identifier. The US dollar (USD) year for the model data, where USD is used, is 2012. See any additional notes in Contents on specific components. A complete description can be found in the associated manuscript. \n",

The names and outcomes of the different assays were harmonized, and assays were annotated by type: gene mutation in Salmonella bacteria (Ames assay) and chromosome mutation (clastogenicity) in vitro or in vivo (chromosome aberration, micronucleus, and mouse lymphoma Tk+/- assays). This dataset was then evaluated to assess genotoxic potential using a categorization scheme, whereby a substance was considered genotoxic if it was positive in at least one Ames or clastogen study. The categorization dataset comprised 8442 chemicals, of which 2728 chemicals were genotoxic, 5585 were not and 129 were inconclusive. QSAR models (TEST and VEGA) and the OECD Toolbox structural alerts/profilers (e.g., OASIS DNA alerts for Ames and chromosomal aberrations) were used to make in silico predictions of genotoxicity potential. The performance of the individual QSAR tools and structural alerts resulted in balanced accuracies of 57-73%. A Na\u00efve Bayes consensus model was developed using combinations of QSAR models and structural alert predictions. The \u2018best\u2019 consensus model selected had a balanced accuracy of 81.2%, a sensitivity of 87.24% and a specificity of 75.20%.

Consumers purchase and use a wide variety of products containing potentially thousands of chemicals. There is a need to identify potential real-world chemical co-exposures in order to prioritize in vitro toxicity screening. However, due to the vast number of potential chemical combinations, this has been a major challenge.\n\nObjectives: We aim to develop and implement a data-driven procedure for identifying prevalent chemical combinations to which humans are exposed through purchase and use of consumer products.\n\nMethods: We applied frequent itemset mining on an integrated dataset linking consumer product chemical ingredient data with product purchasing data from sixty thousand households to identify chemical combinations resulting from co-use of consumer products.\n\nResults: We identified co-occurrence patterns of chemicals over all households as well as those specific to demographic groups based on race/ethnicity, income, education, and family composition. We also identified chemicals with the highest potential for aggregate exposure by identifying chemicals occurring in multiple products used by the same household. Lastly, a case study of chemicals active in estrogen and androgen receptor in silico models revealed priority chemical combinations co-targeting receptors involved in important biological signaling pathways.\n\nDiscussion: Integration and comprehensive analysis of household purchasing data and product-chemical information provided a means to assess human near-field exposure and inform selection of chemical combinations for high-throughput screening in in vitro assays. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nStanfield, Z., C.

Although the impacts of abiotic properties of wetlands on amphibians have been extensively tested, data regarding how biological characteristics of ephemeral wetlands shape amphibian populations is lacking.  Across a series of wetlands, we captured and sampled larval pond-breeding salamanders and aquatic invertebrates, and quantified diet items of salamanders to examine what properties influence densities of larval salamanders, aquatic invertebrates, and properties that drive predation of salamanders on aquatic invertebrates.  We found site-level and landscape-level properties influenced salamander and invertebrate densities.  Our data suggest larval salamanders have a predation bias for and against certain taxa in wetlands.  Salamanders selected against predation of invertebrate predators and selected primarily for the collector-filterer functional group.  Despite these preferences, salamander predation did not have measurable influence on aquatic invertebrate density.  Furthermore, although pond-breeding salamanders can reach high densities in ephemeral wetlands and select for specific prey items, they do not have measurable influence over macroinvertebrate community structure. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nStruecker, B., J.

For example, a user would be able to access information on materials of similar composition, size range, reactivity, or other properties measured, and see what results were observed.

More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following disturbance. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico\u2019s coral reefs modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators and identified which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites\u2019 resilience scores with ocean warming predictions to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or local managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a \u201cdesktop\u201d assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field\nsurvey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGibbs, D., and J.

+            "description": "Climate change threatens coral reefs through multiple pathways and interactions with local stressors. More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following disturbance. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico\u2019s coral reefs modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators and identified which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites\u2019 resilience scores with ocean warming predictions to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or local managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a \u201cdesktop\u201d assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field\nsurvey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGibbs, D., and J. West. Resilience assessment of Puerto Rico\u2019s coral reefs to inform reef management.   PLOS ONE. Public Library of Science, San Francisco, CA, USA, 14(11): e0224360, (2019).",

After isolation of A. hydrillicola from environmental samples and adaptation to laboratory conditions, the cyanobacterium was cultivated in BG11 medium with or without the addition of potassium bromide. H. verticillata leaves colonized with A. hydrillicola were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy as well as AP-MALDI-MSI (9-AA as matrix in negative-ionization mode; lateral resolution, 10 \u03bcm). Environmental bromide and bromine concentrations in H. verticillata, sediment, and water samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and ion chromatography. The structure of AETX was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography after isolation of the compound using flash chromatography, semipreparative HPLC, and recrystallization. The genome of A. hydrillicola was amplified from single filaments using multiple displacement amplification and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The putative AETX biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by BLASTp searches for bacterial halogenases against the A. hydrillicola genome. The halogenase AetF was heterologously expressed in E. coli and then purified. Biochemical assays to characterize its activity used tryptophans and indoles as substrates. Reaction products were structurally characterized by HPLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. A. hydrillicola\u2013H. verticillata extract fractions and pure AETX were tested for activity on C. dubia, D. rerio, C. elegans, and G. gallus. Bioassays on D. rerio and G. gallus were performed in accordance with the National Insitutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed protocol A2017 11-007-Y1-A0, which was reviewed, approved, and overseen by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. VM occurrence in treated birds was confirmed by analysis of the white matter of their optic lobe using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Tissues of deceased wild birds were extracted and analyzed for AETX by HPLC-MS. A full description of the materials and methods used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials.

New hemispheric and North American emissions inventories were developed using, to the extent possible, consistent input data and methods across all years, including emissions from mobile, fire, and oil and gas sources.

We have selected a subset of the model input and output datasets that we hope will be most useful to the air quality research community.

Childhood general cognitive ability is a well-studied area of research and can be used to predict social outcomes and perceived success. Early life stage (e.g., prenatal, postnatal, toddler) exposures to stressors (i.e., chemical and non-chemical stressors from the total (built, natural, social) environment) can impact the development of childhood cognitive ability. Building from our systematic scoping review (Ruiz et al., 2016), we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate more than 100 stressors related to cognitive development. Our meta-analysis identified 23 stressors with a significant increase in their likelihood to influence childhood cognitive ability by 10% or more, and 80 stressors were observed to have a statistically significant effect on cognitive ability. Stressors most impactful to cognition during the prenatal period were related to maternal health and the mother\u2019s ability to access information relevant to a healthy pregnancy (e.g., diet, lifestyle). Stressors most impactful to cognition during the early childhood period were dietary nutrients (infancy), quality of social interaction (toddler), and exposure to toxic substances (throughout early childhood). In conducting this analysis, we examined the relative impact of real-world exposures on cognitive development to attempt to understand the inter-relationships between exposures to both chemical and non-chemical stressors and early developmental life stages. Our findings suggest that the stressors observed to be the most influential to childhood cognitive ability are not permanent and can be broadly categorized as activities/behaviors which can be modified to improve childhood cognition. This meta-analysis supports the idea that there are complex relationships between a child\u2019s total environment and early cognitive development. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNilsen, F., J.

S., Fann, N., \"Regional Temperature-Ozone Relationships Across the U.S. Under Multiple Climate and Emissions Scenarios,\" 2020.\n\nMODEL VERSION AND CONFIGURATION\n\nThe Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used. The model is open source and can be freely downloaded at\nhttp://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. The specific code version used in this study was based on a pre-release version of CMAQ 5.3, with minor modifications to accommodate the USGS28 land-use scheme used in WRF. The model source code is included in the \"src\" directory.\n\nThe meteorological input data for CMAQ were derived from outputs of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) following Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which represents a relatively high warming scenario.  The CESM and CM3 fields were downscaled to 36-km grid cells over North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The downscaling and air quality modeling procedure are described in the associated manuscript (Nolte et al., submitted manuscript, 2020) and references therein.\n\nCMAQ simulations were conducted using the meteorology downscaled from the two climate models and using two different sets of anthropogenic emissions: the 2011 National Emission Inventory and a 2040 projection developed for analysis of the Heavy Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule. This 2040 projection represents significant reductions relative to present-day of pollutant emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See U.S. EPA (2016) for further information on the anthropogenic emissions. Climate-sensitive VOCs emitted from vegetation, e.g., isoprene, were modeled within CMAQ using the downscaled meteorological projections from WRF. \n\nCMAQ was used to simulate air pollutant concentrations over the continental United States using grid cells with 36km x 36km horizontal spacing, with the height of the lowest model layer around 38 m. Further details on the model configuration and input data are described in the manuscript.\n\nFigures used in this paper were prepared using version 3.6.1 of the R programming language. R is open source, and can be downloaded at www.r-project.org. The R scripts are labeled according to their figure number, and reference all data needed to generate the figures, which are located in the \"figs\" folder. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNolte, C., T.

S., Fann, N., \"Regional Temperature-Ozone Relationships Across the U.S. Under Multiple Climate and Emissions Scenarios,\" 2020.\n\nMODEL VERSION AND CONFIGURATION\n\nThe Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used. The model is open source and can be freely downloaded at\nhttp://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. The specific code version used in this study was based on a pre-release version of CMAQ 5.3, with minor modifications to accommodate the USGS28 land-use scheme used in WRF. The model source code is included in the \"src\" directory.\n\nThe meteorological input data for CMAQ were derived from outputs of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) following Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which represents a relatively high warming scenario.  The CESM and CM3 fields were downscaled to 36-km grid cells over North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The downscaling and air quality modeling procedure are described in the associated manuscript (Nolte et al., submitted manuscript, 2020) and references therein.\n\nCMAQ simulations were conducted using the meteorology downscaled from the two climate models and using two different sets of anthropogenic emissions: the 2011 National Emission Inventory and a 2040 projection developed for analysis of the Heavy Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule. This 2040 projection represents significant reductions relative to present-day of pollutant emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See U.S. EPA (2016) for further information on the anthropogenic emissions. Climate-sensitive VOCs emitted from vegetation, e.g., isoprene, were modeled within CMAQ using the downscaled meteorological projections from WRF. \n\nCMAQ was used to simulate air pollutant concentrations over the continental United States using grid cells with 36km x 36km horizontal spacing, with the height of the lowest model layer around 38 m. Further details on the model configuration and input data are described in the manuscript.\n\nFigures used in this paper were prepared using version 3.6.1 of the R programming language. R is open source, and can be downloaded at www.r-project.org. The R scripts are labeled according to their figure number, and reference all data needed to generate the figures, which are located in the \"figs\" folder. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNolte, C., T.

Tests were conducted in a 14.3 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m tank under both calm and wave-action conditions. Emissions and residual uncombusted oil were sampled to characterize the effect of variations in boom length/width ratios, injection air, and presence or absence of waves. Tests were done with 30 L of Alaska North Slope oil within an outdoor, above ground, fresh water, 63 m3 tank equipped with wave actuators and baffles. The combustion plume was sampled for emissions using a crane-suspended instrument system. Combustion efficiencies based on unburned carbon in the plume emissions ranged from 85% to 93%. Efficiencies based on oil mass loss ranged from 89% to 99% but were not predicted by changes in boom ratio, air injection, or the presence of waves. A four-fold variation in PM2.5 emission factors was observed from the test conditions and the most effective burns in terms of reduced emissions were those that had high length to width boom ratios resulting in higher flame front surface area exposure to ambient air. The presence of added injection air near the oil/water/flame interface had no statistical effect on the combustion efficiency, suggesting that added oxygen and air-induced turbulence at the oil/flame interface was not limiting the combustion rate. The presence of waves had a limited detrimental effect on combustion emissions, possibly caused by enhancing heat loss from the burning oil to the water below. Post-burn, residual oil samples were collected and analyzed to show that the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the residuals decreased as the oil mass loss increased. The amount of oil mass lost was not related to any combustion efficiency parameters or pollutant levels. However, TPH in residues were significantly lower at higher boom ratios in the control and air plus waves tests. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nAurell, J., A.

We selected 14 chemicals based on their risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and tested them in hepatocytes at two treatment concentrations. HTTr data was generated using the TempO-Seq whole transcriptome and S1500+ assays. The HTTr platform exhibited high reproducibility between technical replicates (r>0.9) but biological replication was greater for TempO-Seq S1500+ (r>0.85) than for the whole transcriptome (r>0.7). Reproducibility between biological replicates was dependent on the strength of transcriptional effects induced by a chemical treatment. Despite targeting a smaller number of genes, the S1500+ assay clustered chemical treatments and produced gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) scores comparable to those of the whole transcriptome. Connectivity mapping showed a high-level of reproducibility between TempO-Seq data and Affymetrix GeneChip data from the Open TG-GATES project with high concordance between the S1500+ gene set and whole transcriptome. Taken together, our results provide guidance on selecting the number of technical and biological replicates and support the use of TempO-Seq S1500+ assay for a high-throughput platform for screening hepatotoxicants.\nFASTQ files and read counts data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE152128). \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLee, F., I.

The flood discharge is simulated by HEC-HMS model using 24-hours storm and runoff curve number method. HEC-RAS 2D is used to simulate flood with 48-hours duration. The External Coupler program links HEC-RAS 2D and WASP in an offline and one-way direction. The Coupler is developed in python. The source code, executable file, and users\u2019 manual for the program are available in the External Coupler folder. Using hydrodynamic file generated by the External Coupler, WASP simulated sediment and contaminant transport in flood. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nShabani, A., S.
