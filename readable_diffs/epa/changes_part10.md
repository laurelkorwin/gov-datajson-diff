             "description": "The Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for U.S. counties is a set of nationally consistent demonstration results that may be used to characterize community well-being. This composite index was developed by U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development in support of its Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) Research. It serves as an endpoint measure for use in the creation of community decision-support tools. The HWBI characterizes community conditions in the context of the flow of economic, social and ecological services. The index calculation approach used a nested-indicator design. A decade (2000-2010) of cultural, economic, and social data were drawn from publicly available sources (e.g., US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, American Community Survey, General Social Survey, Centers for Disease Control) to provide the foundation for well-being related indicators. Indicators are integrated into one of eight domains or sub-indices of well-being. These domains were synthesized to represent different aspects of well-being characteristics common across communities of all sizes. Service indicators reflect the availability of select socio-ecological services that influence well-being. Community decisions often result in changes in the flow of community services. Collectively, well-being and service measures provide a means to evaluate relationships between the availability of certain community services and overall well-being. Data used to generate service indicators were also collected from existing data sources. Detailed information about the attributes of the HWBI, its components and related service indicators are described in Indicators and Methods for Constructing a U.S. Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for Ecosystem Services Research (EPA/600/R-12/023. pp. 121) and Indicators and Methods for Evaluating Economic, Ecosystem and Social Services Provisioning (EPA/600/R-14/184. pp. 174), respectively.",

The ecoregions of Alaska are a framework for organizing and interpreting environmental data for State, national, and international level inventory, monitoring, and research efforts. The map and descriptions for 20 ecological regions were derived by synthesizing information on the geographic distribution of environmental factors such as climate, physiography, geology, permafrost, soils, and vegetation. A qualitative assessment was used to interpret the distributional patterns and relative importance of these factors from place to place (Gallant and others, 1995). Numeric identifiers assigned to the ecoregions are coordinated with those used on the map of \"Ecoregions of the Conterminous United States\" (Omernik 1987, U.S. EPA 2010) as a continuation of efforts to map ecoregions for the United States. Additionally, the ecoregions for Alaska and the conterminous United States, along with ecological regions for Canada (Wiken 1986) and Mexico, have been combined for maps at three hierarchical levels for North America (Omernik 1995, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 1997, 2006). A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels of ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions. At Level III, there are currently 182 ecological regions for North America. Level IV ecoregions have been developed for the conterminous United States, but Level III is the highest level available for Alaska.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. By recognizing the spatial differences in the capacities and potentials of ecosystems, ecoregions stratify the environment by its probable response to disturbance (Bryce and others, 1999). These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and non-government organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas (Omernik and others, 2000). The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the spatial patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken, 1986; Omernik, 1987, 1995). These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989). This product is part of a collaborative effort primarily between USEPA Region VII, USEPA National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (Corvallis, Oregon), Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Multi-Agency Wetland Planning Team (MAWPT), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Department of Interior - Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and U.S. Department of Interior - U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) - Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center. The project is associated with an interagency effort to develop a common framework of ecological regions. Reaching that objective requires recognition of the differences in the conceptual approaches and mapping methodologies that have been used to develop the most common ecoregion-type frameworks, including those developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USFS) (Bailey and others, 1994), the USEPA (Omernik, 1987, 1995), and the NRCS (United States Department of Agriculture - Soil Conservation Service, 1981). As each of these frameworks is further refined, their differences are becoming less discernible. Regional collaborative projects such as this one in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, where agreement can be reached among multiple resource management agencies, are a step toward attaining consensus and consistency in ecoregion frameworks for the entire nation.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997).

-            "description": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

             "description": "This high-level metadata data document will be supplemented with detailed regional metadata at a later date. The NHDPlusV2 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). Interest in estimating stream flow volume and velocity to support pollutant fate-and-transport modeling was the driver behind the joint USEPA and USGS effort to develop the initial NHDPlus, referenced in this document as NHDPlusV1. NHDPlusV1 has been used in a wide variety of applications since its initial release in the fall of 2006. This widespread positive response prompted the multi-agency NHDPlus team to develop NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2). The NHDPlusV2 includes a stream network (based on the NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlusV2 also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the NHD network and building \"walls\" using the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The hydro-enforced digital elevation model (DEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the USGS, USEPA and contractors, has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process. The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by-flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; select a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes. The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and runoff distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs. NHDPlusV2 in CONUS contains a snapshot (2012) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved over the snapshot used in NHDPlusV1. These updates have not been stored in the central NHD repository at USGS. NHDPlusV2 in the islands is basin on a 2014/2015 snapshot of the 1:24,000 NHD. NHDPlusV2 users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlusV2 with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Updates to the 1:100,000-scale NHD snapshot should be sent to the USEPA as the primary steward. Updates to the 1:24,000-scale NHD shapshot should be sent to the USGS. Purpose: The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water-related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. NHDPlusV2 serves as the sample frame for the stream and lake surveys conducted by the USEPA under the National Aquatic Resources Surveys program. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilizes the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.",

These waters were listed by the state as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The status of TMDLs were also tracked. TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. Under Section 305(b) of the CWA, the states, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United States are required to submit reports on the quality of their waters to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) every 2 years.",

Combined sewer systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. Most of the time, combined sewer systems transport all of their wastewater to a sewage treatment plant, where it is treated and then discharged to a water body. During periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt, however, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant. For this reason, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess untreated wastewater directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.

The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA sets limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the air anywhere in the United States. Pursuant to section 109(d) of the CAA EPA is required to review and promulgate new NAAQS every five years, as appropriate. This ensures that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental protections. The law allows individual states to have stronger pollution controls, but states are not allowed to have weaker pollution controls than those set for the whole country. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria air pollutants\" because the agency has regulated them by first developing health-based criteria (science-based guidelines) as the basis for setting permissible levels. One set of limits (primary standard) protects health; another set of limits (secondary standard) is intended to prevent environmental and property damage. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas.

The results from the diversity, rarity, and sustainability layers are summed to create the composite grid with scores potentially ranging from 3 to 300. The higher scores represent areas that may be of a higher ecological importance.TERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The TEAP is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

This report summarizes the analytical and field results from a pilot investigation performed to assess mercury contamination. Understanding the sources and transformations of mercury aided in planning future RI activities and pilot studies to assess mercury fate and transport in the Carson River and the Lahontan Reservoir. Soil samples from erosional banks along a 4-mile segment of the Carson River upstream of the Lahontan Reservoir were collected and analyzed in this pilot investigation to characterize mercury variability in exposed banks prone to erosion. This report presents the following information: Results of soil sampling and analysis, evaluation of data quality and compliance with the field sampling plan (FSP), discussion of the data, conclusions and recommendations for further study.  The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

             "description": "As a component of the ecological assessment for the Carson River Mercury Site, EPA conducted a survey of benthic macroinvertebrates to evaluate the potential adverse effects of mercury in surface water and sediment of the Carson River. Measures of benthic community response to mercury contamination derived from the benthic survey are presented in this the EcoRisk Assessment, Appendix C. A characterization of the existing environment at the sampling locations-including the habitat characteristics, fish and wildlife populations, and surrounding land use.\n\n    Rapid BioAssessment Protocol II (RBP) involves the standardized collection, enumeration, and identification of major benthic taxa to the family level in riffle/run habitats. Standard data sheets are used to record results at each sampling. location. Collections are compared to a reference location, and an evaluation is made as to the impairment, or lack thereof, of the benthic community from stressors within the watershed.\n\n    The biological condition of the community can be ranked according to three categories of impact: nonimpaired, moderately impaired, or severely impaired, where the degree of impairment implies less than optimal community structure, the loss of intolerant species, and dominance by a few tolerant taxa compared to background. RBP II also involves assessment of habitat characteristics such as stream flow, bottom conditions, and riparian vegetation. In addition, standard water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, color, and turbidity are determined. The RBP II was conducted on August 17 and 18, 1994 during a period of drought. ",

Dairy waste threatens the quality of drinking water for up to 20 million Californians. The pollution created by dairies comes primarily from manure. Across California, dairy cows create more than 65 billion pounds of manure per year. Even when excess manure is used as fertilizer, this waste runs off fields into California's waterways, eventually contaminating aquatic habitats and public water sources. A major source of reactive organic gases, dairy manure also contributes to air pollution.",

             "description": "This feature class contains parcel boundaries and their environmental covenant status within the Carson River Estates subdivision in Lyon County, Nevada. An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Carson River Estates subdivision is located within Operable Unit 1 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS). Parcel boundaries were extracted from the Lyon County parcels layer, and then attributed with information pertaining to the environmental covenant (if applicable).",

             "description": "For the Ecological Risk Assessment Report, EPA collected these samples, consisting of benthic invertebrates (crayfish), from three contaminated locations in the Carson River upstream from Lahontan Reservoir (Santiago Ruins, Dayton State Park, and Fort Churchill) and one background location (Ruhenstroth Dam).  As a component of the ecological assessment for the Carson River Mercury Site, a survey of benthic macroinvertebrates was conducted to evaluate the potential adverse effects of mercury in surface water and sediment of the Carson River. Measures of benthic community response to mercury contamination derived from the benthic survey are presented in this the EcoRisk Assessment, Appendix C. A characterization of the existing environment at the sampling locations-including the habitat characteristics, fish and wildlife populations, and surrounding land use.\n\nRapid BioAssessment Protocol II (RBP) involves the standardized collection, enumeration, and identification of major benthic taxa to the family level in riffle/run habitats. Standard data sheets are used to record results at each sampling. location. Collections are compared to a reference location, and an evaluation is made as to the impairment, or lack thereof, of the benthic community from stressors within the watershed. The biological condition of the community can be ranked according to three categories of impact: nonimpaired, moderately impaired, or severely impaired, where the degree of impairment implies less than optimal community structure, the loss of intolerant species, and dominance by a few tolerant taxa compared to background. RBP II also involves assessment of habitat characteristics such as stream flow, bottom conditions, and riparian vegetation. In addition, standard water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, color, and turbidity are determined.\n\nThe RBP II was conducted on August 17 and 18, 1994 during a period of drought. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU1 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 1994) as well as the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), describing the nature and extent of contamination from the Site, primarily the Ecological Risk Assessment Report.  The RI report also contains the Human Health Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

             "description": "This is a summary of mercury (Hg) data from fish collected in the Lahontan Reservoir area of the Carson River Basin.   NDOW collected the fish and the EPA Region 9 Laboratory analyzed the tissue for mercury (Hg) for EPA's Impaired Waters Program, water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. These data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan Reservoir area, used by recreationalists and fishermen, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.\n\nThe elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink. This area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink.\n\nThe EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

The goal of the study is to select a remedy that eliminates, reduces, or controls risks from site-related compounds of concern to human health and the environment.  Specifically, the RI involves the investigation and study of the heavy metals contamination and the associated tributaries into the Carson River watershed resulting from site-related contaminant migration and to evaluate past and current releases and their impact to human health and the environment.\n\n    The Site includes mercury-contaminated soils at former mill sites, mercury contamination in waterways adjacent to the mill sites, and mercury contamination in sediments and banks fish and wildlife over more than a 80 mile length of the River, beginning near Carson City, Nevada and extending downstream to the Lahontan Valley and ultimately at its terminus at the USFWS Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. Contamination at the Site is a legacy of the Comstock mining era of the late 1860s, when mercury was imported to the area for processing of gold and silver ore. Ore mined from the Comstock Lode was transported to the mill sites, where it was crushed and mixed with mercury to amalgamate the precious metals (Washoe Process). The mills were primarily located in Virginia City, Silver City, Gold Hill, Dayton, Six Mile Canyon, Gold Canyon, and adjacent to the Carson River between New Empire and Dayton. During the mining era, an estimated 7,500 tons of mercury were discharged into the River drainage, primarily in the form of mercury-contaminated tailings.",

Incremental samples were collected from three separate areas within the CRMS: Six Mile Canyon Area near Mark Twain, NV; California Pan Mill in Virginia City, NV; and Sacramento Mill in Virginia City, NV. The purpose of the data collection was to help characterize the extent of Hg, Pb, and As in surface (0 to 6-inch) and in some locations subsurface (0 to 24-inch) soils in the three study areas. A secondary purpose of the study was to demonstrate incremental sampling techniques and field XRF analysis to EPA Region 9 and NDEP Staff. The XRF results columns in the attribute table were generated by XRF data collected in accordance with the EPA-Approved Quality Assurance Project Plan and are considered definitive results suitable for project decisions. 30-point incremental samples were sieved to the 100-mesh fraction, placed \u201cinterference free\u201d XRF read bags, and analyzed with EPA Headquarters\u2019 Niton XRF. At least two XRF measurements were collected on each side of the bag resulting in at least four readings that were used to calculate the sample bag average that appears in the XRF Results columns for Hg, Pb, and As. If triplicate results were collected for a given sample, the mean is reported in the XRF Results columns for Hg, Pb, and As and the results for each of the three replicates are detailed in the XRF Notes column.",

More specifically, it contains reach codes for networked features and isolated lakes, flow direction, names, stream level, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined to represent water bodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

             "description": "USGS conducted preliminary assays on aged (3 mo.) surface sediment (0-4 cm) collected from 13 sites during October 1998 in order to decipher general spatial trends in Hg-speciation, microbiology and relevant biogeochemistry. During the second field campaign sample processing and incubations were conducted at ambient temperature within hours of sediment collection to provide a more accurate measure of in-situ process rates and analyte concentrations. The third field sampling (October 1999), involving 14 sampling and was conducted with a similar approach as in June 1999. The latter two data sets provide a direct seasonal comparison (summer/fall, high/lo flow conditions) of Hg transformation dynamics in the CRS. Sediment depth profiles (0-16 cm) were investigated at four sites during June 1999 and at two of these four during October 1999. Eroding vertical bank material was sampled in the Hg-contaminated Fort Churchill region during both 1999 dates. Laboratory experiments were conducted using sediment collected during the latter two sampling dates.\n\nThe study purpose sought to: a) identify important zones of net methylmercury (MeHg) production and consumption within the CRS, b) determine which environmental factors most strongly influence these processes and c) provide estimates of seasonal variability. Measurements were made of microbial Hg-transformations (via radiotracer) and in-situ Hg speciation (total mercury (Hgt), MeHg, and particle-associated acid-extractable Hg(II)). Acid extractable Hg(II) was used as a surrogate measure for the Hg(II) most readily available to bacteria for methylation. A novel Hg-biosensor technique was also used to assess bioavailable Hg(II) in pore-water. A suite of ancillary microbial processes and sediment geochemical parameters were also measured to more fully characterize each site, and to relate these measurements to observed Hg-transformation rates and Hg-speciation.\n\nThe EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.

             "description": "The Region 9 CRMS risk assessor specifically identified the need to obtain data for Tribal lands near Fallon, Nevada.  Based on a 1994 study performed on OU1 samples, an estimated 12% of total mercury measurements is mercuric chloride (HgCl2).  The Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) summarized the OU1 historical analytical approaches for \u201cspeciation\u201d with currently available methods summarized.  Based on team scoping meeting with EPA Region 10 and the Region 9 Toxicologist, use of the Brooks Applied Lab (BRL) sequential extraction was selected primarily for reasons of comparability of approaches to simplify data assessment.  (EPA Method 3200 was presented for comparative purposes.)\n\nThere are significant sources of uncertainty in \u201cspeciation\u201d using any approach, as each is technically a procedurally defined fractionation that may include other mercury species not specifically identified.  As an example of this uncertainty, under the OU1 study of the EPA Las Vegas Lab data, it was unclear which fraction would have captured mercury oxide or whether the residual chlorides caused minor amounts of sulfide to combine with the nitric acid fraction. While the Oak Ridge approach may have reported mercuric chloride in the elemental mercury fraction.\n\nThe primary factors driving the need for this speciation data were uncertainty about the quality of the historical OU1 data; applicability of the OU1 data at the locations below Lahontan Reservoir, and concerns expressed by the Region 9 CRMS risk assessor to better obtain direct measurement data near the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe.  The data generated by this sampling were reviewed for laboratory quality control but decisions with the data were made by the EPA Region 9 CRMS risk assessor.\n",

             "description": "This feature class depicts Comstock-era mill locations within the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS). These locations were obtained in order to define the investigation area boundaries of Operable Unit 1 (OU1) within CRMS. Completion of this dataset took place over several years and phases, as described below. \n\nEPA survey:\nThe first mill survey took place in 1993 by EPA, contracted by Piedmont Engineering.113 mills were identified in this survey. Later, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) conducted historic research on Comstock-era mills to expand upon this dataset, identifying an additional 87 mill sites, bringing the total number of mills in the dataset to 200. This process is described below.\n\nNDEP Historical Research:\nMill site locations were determined based on georeferenced maps procured from the EPA, NDEP, Storey County and the UNR digital map library. All maps were georeferenced based on available landmarks by heads-up digitizing techniques. The maps utilized had varying degrees of accuracy based on their date of production. Some maps utilized dated back to the 1860's.\nOnce all historic maps were scanned, imported and georeferenced, all map sources were evaluated and mill site locations were digitized based on the preponderance of evidence (by comparing mill locations as shown on the various source maps) to determine each mill's location.\n\nA vector layer of mill sites was thus constructed using georeferenced raster layer resources. This layer of mill sites contains the locations of 188 historic Comstock Era mills as well as 12 additional tailings locations that are not directly associated with a mill site. 33 additional sites were identified; these consisted of sites that were known to exist but not located on historic maps, as well as cyanide mills. \n\nBroadbent and Associates, Inc. field surveys:\nIn 2012 NDEP contracted Broadbent and Associates, Inc. to survey all mill sites defined in this dataset. The contractor successfully verified the remains and evidence of 73 mills. Inconclusive mill evidence was found for 98 of the sites in the dataset. For 65 mill sites, the contractor was not given permission by the landowner to access the property and therefore the mill site location was not surveyed. Survey status is unknown for 1 mill.\n\nThe contractor provided a feature class of all 236 mills accompanied by a detailed report on their survey efforts, listed below:\nBroadbent and Associates, Inc., Eric M. Seitz, Project Manager. January 31, 2013, Final Report \u2013 Comstock Archaeological Mill Site Inventory, Unpublished. \n\nNDEP reviewed this report and the associated feature class to confirm each mill point location and provide attribute information on the survey status of each mill site. NDEP added the attrtibute field \"Field Verified\" to provide information on the field verification status of each site. A value of \"No\" indicates the site was not surveyed in the field. This was due to to access limitations and denials for sites located on private property. A value of \"Yes\" indicates the site was surveyed and evidence of the mill was found. A value of \"Surveyed\" indicates the site was surveyed but inconclusive or little evidence of a mill was found.\n",

An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Onda Verde subdivision is located within Operable Unit 2 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS).",

             "description": "URS Corporation (URS) developed a Sampling and Analysis Plan in September 2011 that was consistent with the CRMS draft Long Term Sampling and Response Plan. URS submitted a draft SAP to NDEP for review and incorporated NDEP\u2019s comments in the Final SAP. In October and November 2011, URS performed a Phase II ESA on the Site. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate if impacts related to the CRMS are present on the 138 undeveloped residential lots and one partially developed lot. The lots subject to the Phase II ESA were owned by two separate entities and the Phase II ESA was divided accordingly. Section I: URS sampled lots 2 - 160, located in the westernmost section of the subdivision. Samples took place between 10/24/2011 and 11/2/2011. The sample date in the attribute table indicates the last date in the sampling period for this segment. Section 2: URS Corporation sampled lots M41 - M86, located in the easternmost section of the subdivision. Samples took place between 10/26/2011 and 11/1/2011. The sample date in the attribute table indicates the last date in the sampling period for this segment. Sample locations were collected using a Trimble GeoXT GPS unit.

             "description": "This feature class depicts the boundaries of Operable Unit 1 (OU1) within the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS), including the four Area of Investigation boundaries.\n\nNDEP lead an initiative to refine the boundaries shown on maps identifying the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site (CRMS) from the initial site identification and description as the Carson River hydrographic basin beginning in Carson City, NV to its terminal points in Churchill County, NV. This description of the CRMS was used in many of the early site investigation studies and reports and continued to be used in all public education and long-term site management controls until approximately 2012. Using site contaminant fate and transport determinations from the CRMS OU1 Remedial Investigation (RI) and Conceptual Site Model (CSM), it seemed inappropriate to include the much larger area of the hydrographic basin as being potentially impacted by site contaminants of concern (CoC). NDEP created protocols to estimate areas that are likely to have been impacted by CoCs and created maps using these protocols to redraw the CRMS boundary limits.\n \nIn the development of these protocols, NDEP used: \nHistoric records and documentation of probable source areas; The 2012 archaeological mill site research and field study conducted by Broadbent and Associates to locate the historic source areas; Soil and sediment transport mechanisms identified in the CSM and general soil transport and sedimentology principals to predict areas where CoCs have likely been located at and downstream of the historic sources. \n\nThe overall area of transport was estimated to be reasonably large to include possible anthropogenic activity as well as historic and future natural events such as flooding and channel migration. Additionally, NDEP added a \"buffer\u201d to extend the potential areas beyond the conservatively defined primary areas of potential contamination to further address unknown and future effects. These buffers have been identified separately from the primary areas of concern and labeled as such on maps using these protocols. These revisions were formalized in the 2013 Explanation of Significant Differences to the OU-1 Record of Decision (RoD) to adopt the new site definition and boundaries identified by NDEP as new estimates of the CRMS extents. \n\nNDEP identified four geographic areas of prime importance to the CRMS. Originally labeled by NDEP as \"Risk Areas\u201d, the intent of this terminology was to indicate these were the areas understood to have the most likely \"risk\u201d of contamination. Under consultation with EPA R9 risk assessment staff, the term has been changed to \"Area of Investigation\u201d to avoid confusion that any actual quantitative level of human or ecological risk has been determined for these areas. They are only estimates of potential contamination and new or additional information that contradicts these boundaries as being insufficient will be used to adopt new boundaries as appropriate. The four Areas of Investigation have become the foundation for the residential soil sampling program mandated by the OU-1 RoD. Summarized briefly; \n\nInvestigation Area 1 (IA 1)- This includes all areas in the Carson River drainage basin from about the area of the historic settlement of Empire in Carson City, NV downstream to the existing or historic terminal points of the river at Carson Lake, Carson Sink, Indian Lakes and the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge that lie outside the buffer zones of the other three Investigation Areas. It is least probable that CRMS CoCs will be located in these areas. It is unlikely that any sampling will be requested on areas developed within IA 1, but it might be requested in special circumstances, especially near and around the source areas of the contamination where historic activities could potentially have caused contamination beyond the typical boundaries as identified by the CSM. \n\nInvestigation Area 2 (IA 2)- This area is defined as a buffer that lies 100 feet along a normal horizontal to the Investigation Area 3 boundary. For Comstock-era mill sites and isolated tailings piles, this translates to the area between 350 feet and 450 feet from the center point of the historic feature. For the 100-year FEMA floodplain and areas of irrigation, this is the area beginning at the limit of the flood plain boundary or irrigated land along a normal to 100 feet. \n\nInvestigation Area 3 (IA 3)- This area is defined as a buffer that lies 100 feet along a normal horizontal to the Investigation Area 4 boundary for Comstock-era mills or isolated tailings piles. For Comstock-era mill sites and isolated tailings piles, this translates to the area between 250 feet and 350 feet from the center point of the historic feature. It is also defined as the limits of the FEMA 100-year floodplain or past or current flood irrigation practices. A tributary of the Carson River must have a Comstock-era mill site or tailings pile located along it to be mapped in IA3 and only the portion of the tributary downstream of the historic feature is included, not including the IA3 area and buffer drawn around the historic feature itself. If a tributary does not have FEMA 100-year flood plain defined, then IA3 has been defined as the area 100 feet along a normal to Investigation Area 4 boundary of that tributary. \n\nInvestigation Area 4 (IA 4)- This area represents the highest likelihood of mercury contamination. Multiple steps were used to define the extent of this area, described below: \n\nThe area within a 250 feet radius from the center point of a Comstock-era mill \nComstock-era tailings pile polygon with a 250 ft buffer \nThe centerline of the current channel of the Carson River enclosed in a polygon 100-feet wide (50 feet either side). \nTributaries to the Carson River, where Comstock-era mills and tailings piles were located are enclosed in a polygon 50-feet wide (25 feet either side) from the approximate center of the tributary channel. \nIrrigation canals are enclosed in a polygon 20 feet wide (10 feet either side) from the approximate center of the ditch.\n\n",

             "description": "EPA has compiled a significant volume of soil, sediment, surface water and biota geodata, collected either directly, by our contractors and in many cases by our Federal, State and Tribal agency partners (grantees) to complete the remedial investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study at the Operable Unit (OU) 2 (i.e., the river, the floodplain and biota).  EPA\u2019s goal for the OU2 area is to select a remedy in 2020 that reduces, or controls risks to human health and the environment.  Specifically, this RI involves the investigation and evaluation of the heavy metals (mercury, arsenic and lead) contamination and associated drainages in the Carson River Basin which has resulted from contaminant migration from the Carson River Mercury Mines Site.\n\nThe Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessments, contained within the RI, evaluated past and current releases and their impact to human health and the environment.  The primary concern is the effect of mercury contamination from the mining operations on the residences near the former stamp mills, the fisheries, waterfowl, water plants and recreational users of the Carson River (\u201cRiver\u201d) Basin.  The OU1 area Superfund Site consists of mining wastes and releases from approximately 236 abandoned gold and silver mines from three basic source areas: the main stem of the River starting at New Empire (Morgan Mill) to Dayton, the Comstock Lode in Gold, Six and Sevenmile Canyons and several mills around Washoe Lake. Mercury from the former mill sites, has contaminated soils at and near the former mill sites, sediments in the drainages and the floodplain, the river banks, the fish and wildlife over more than a 130-mile length of the River extending downstream to the Lahontan Valley and ultimately at its terminus at the USFWS Stillwater and Fallons National Wildlife Refuges.\n\nContamination from the Site is a legacy of the Comstock mining era of the late 1860s, when mercury was imported to the area for processing of gold and silver ore. Ore mined from the Comstock Lode was transported to the individual mill sites, where it was crushed and mixed with mercury to amalgamate the precious metals before refining. The mills were located in the drainages in and around Virginia City, Silver City, Gold Hill, Dayton, Six Mile Canyon, Gold Canyon, and along main stem of the Carson River between New Empire and Dayton. An estimated 7,500 tons of mercury were discharged into the tributaries and River, primarily in the form of mercury-contaminated tailings. ",

             "description": "The dynamic nature of the annual volume of water discharged down the Carson River over a 10-year period, which included a century flood and drought, was examined in order to gain a better understanding of mercury movement, biological availability, and exposure to waterbirds nesting at Lahontan Reservoir. Total annual water discharge directly influenced total mercury (THg) in unfiltered water above the reservoir and downstream of a mining area, whereas methyl mercury (MeHg) at the same site was negatively related to annual discharge. Annual water storage at Lahontan Reservoir in the spring and early summer, as expected, was directly related to annual Carson River discharge. In contrast to the findings from above the reservoir, annual MeHg concentrations in water sampled below the reservoir were positively correlated with the total discharge and the amount of water stored in the reservoir on 1 July; that is, the reservoir is an important location for mercury methylation, which agrees with earlier findings. However, unfiltered water MeHg concentrations were about 10-fold higher above than below the reservoir, which indicated that much MeHg that entered as well as that produced in the reservoir settled out in the reservoir.\n\n    Avian exposure to mercury at Lahontan Reservoir was evaluated in both eggs and blood of young snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax). Annual MeHg concentrations in unfiltered water below the reservoir, during the time period (days 90\u2013190) when birds were present, correlated significantly with mercury concentrations in night-heron blood, snowy egret blood, and night-heron eggs, but not snowy egret eggs. A possible reason for lack of an MeHg water correlation with snowy egret eggs is discussed and relates to potential exposure differences associated with the food habits of both species. THg concentrations in water collected below the reservoir were not related to egg or blood mercury concentrations for either species.\n\n    The initial phase of this study was a 2-year evaluation of the effects of Hg on fish-eating birds nesting at Lahontan Reservoir and Carson Lake and at reference areas in northeastern Nevada (Henny et al. 2002). In the first year (1997), reproduction of snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) was studied via the \u2018\u2018sample egg\u2019\u2019 technique (Blus 1984) (i.e., evaluate reproductive success of each clutch in relationship to the total Hg [THg] concentrations in the sample egg collected from that clutch). Both species laid eggs with comparatively low THg concentrations (Henny et al. 2002). Most eggs had THg concentrations below 0.80 lg/g wet weight (ww), the putative threshold concentration at which reproductive problems might be expected (Heinz 1979; Newton and Haas 1988).\n\n    The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

Each Regional Workgroup has one state and one federal co-chair from environment agencies in each country, and work closely with the NADB to implement projects to fulfill the goals and objectives in Border 2020.  Local Task Forces have been created to identify priority issues and help facilitate pilot projects by engaging with local, state, and tribal governments; academia; NGOs; and the public.\n\nThe California/Baja California Regional Workgroup plan and coordinate activities at the regional level, develop biennial action plans, and support the efforts of local Task Forces.  Each Regional Workgroup has one state and one federal co-chair from environment agencies in each country, and work closely with the NADB to implement projects to fulfill the goals and objectives in Border 2020.  Local Task Forces have been created to identify priority issues and help facilitate pilot projects by engaging with local, state, and tribal governments; academia; NGOs; and the public.\n\nThe Four-State Region extends from the Coahuila-Chihuahua border in Mexico (when that border reaches the Rio Grande, it is in the Big Bend area) eastward to the Gulf of Mexico. The region includes parts of three states and a total of at least 29 municipalities on the Mexican side, and 168 cities and towns on the U.S. side. Recognizing this, the workgroup divided itself into three geographically based Task Forces-Amistad, Falcon, and Gulf, each of which has established subject-specific committees related to its priority concerns.\n\nThe Texas-New Mexico-Chihuahua region stretches approximately 500 miles (800 km) along the international boundary from the Coronado National Forest to Big Bend National Park and includes the following major sister cities: Columbus-Palomas, Las Cruces-El Paso-Ciudad Juarez, and Presidio-Ojinaga. Federal, state and tribal partners from the U.S. and Mexico serve as the co-chairs of the TX/NM/CHIH Regional Workgroup (RWG). The co-chairs support local Task Force efforts and coordinate activities at the regional and local levels.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Riverpark subdivision is located within Operable Unit 1 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS).",

Resource Concepts, Inc. conducted the soil sampling on behalf of the developer Lennar Homes. All final reports were transmitted to NDEP.\n\nEach lot was sampled at two locations: one in the front yard and one in the back yard. One of the samples represented soils from 0 -1 foot below grade (fbg), and the other represented soils from 1- 2 fbg. Samples for each unit were taken over a span of several days. Sample date provided in the attribute table lists the final date of sampling. Sample date ranges for each unit are listed below:\n\nPhase III\nUnit 8: Samples were collected on December 28, 2004.\nUnit 11: Samples were collected between March 1 and March 6, 2006.\nUnit 12: Samples were collected between March 7 and March 9, 2006.\nUnit 13: Samples were collected between March 6 and March 15, 2006.\nUnit 14: Samples were collected on March 20, March 23, and March 24, 2006.\nUnit 15: Samples were collected between August 22 and August 28, 2006.\n\nPhase IV\nUnit 1: Samples were collected on October 10 and October 11, 2006.\nUnit 2: Samples were collected on October 25 and October 26, 2006.\nUnit 3: Samples were collected on April 3 and April 5, 2007.\nUnit 4: Samples were collected on November 28 and November 29, 2006.\n\nAll samples were surveyed in the field using a Trimble 5800 survey-grade GPS receiver tied into centerline monuments. All sample results below the 0.05 mg/kg detection limit are recorded as ND (Non-Detectable).\n\nSample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy of the following report figures:\n\nFigure 1-A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 1(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006), Figure 2-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 2(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006),Figure 3-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 3(Summit Engineering Corp., modified May 22, 2007),\n\nFigure 4- A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 4 (Summit Engineering Corp., modified November 27, 2006).\n\nFigure 8A, Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Figure 8B Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 7, 2006) and Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 14 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 9, 2006).\n\nFigure 11-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 11 ( TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006);\n\nFigure 12-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 12 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006).\n\nFigure 13-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 29, 2006),\n\nFigure 15-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 15 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 8, 2006).\n\nThese figures include the note \"Sample site locations are approximate relative to lot lines in this figure.\" Georeferencing of the sample locations included matching significant landmarks identified on the figures contained in the report to the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u00e2??s parcel map.\n\nReport figures and more information on field sampling procedures can be found in the following source documents:\n\nResource Concepts, Inc., Robin A.

These samples were intended to represent the potential exposure of residents after home construction and the sampling program and design was performed in accordance with guidelines of the draft LTSRP in effect at that time. The following resources were used in compiling this dataset: Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., January 5, 2006, Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1, Final Sampling Results, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C. Report describes the collection of 445 samples collected after completion of finish grade on the Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 residential properties. The report states an additional 28 samples were collected and analyzed in this effort for quality assurance/quality control purposes. This report also briefly summarizes work performed in the 35 acre \u201cOld Pond\u201d area. The report includes a summary table of analytical results titled \u201cSanta (sic) Maria Ranch-Phase I Sampling at Final Lot Grade\u201d. Analytical results from this summary table were associated with the corresponding sample ID to the respective map location. Converse Consultants, drafted by KIB, December 23, 2005, Final Sample Locations, Figure No. 1, sample location plan accompanying January 5, 2006 report referenced above. Figure 1 shows proposed Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 parcel boundaries, streets and open space. It also includes roughly 35 acres of contiguous land east of the residential development proposed to remain as open space. Figure 1 maps the locations of 445 sample locations described in the Final Sampling Results report. Sample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy Figure 1 and matching to significant landmarks in the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u2019s parcel map. Final samples were collected between March 2 and 15, 2005. The sample date in the attribute table refers to the final date of the sampling period. After final sampling completed, 10 additional lots were identified that required additional fill. Samples were collected in these lots on November 28 and 30, 2005.",

Letter report to Dale Denio, North Tahoe Investment Group, L.L.C. summarizing 12 soil samples collected from test pits in vicinity of a historic pond called the \"Old Pond\u201d located on site. \n\nConverse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., July 27, 2004, Santa Maria Ranch, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C., Unpublished. Letter report summarizing sampling and removal activities conducted February 19, 2004 through June 14, 2004 during site preparation and grubbing (mass grading) activities. Report describes 9 test pits excavated and sampled in areas of proposed borrow for backfill during construction, 12 soil samples from the historic pond area (Old Pond) reported in the February 29, 2004 report referenced above and 70 soil samples collected from across the site to assess and monitor areas of disturbed soil. The report\u2019s analytical summary tables are categorized as Borrow Area Test Pits, Old Pond Area, and Mass Grading.\n\nConverse Consultants, drafted by KJB and checked by KIB, July 27, 2004, Test Pit Location Diagram, Figure No. 1, Unpublished. Sample location plan accompanying July 27, 2004 report referenced above. Figure 1 shows proposed Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 parcel boundaries, streets and open space. It also includes roughly 35 acres of the eastern section of the property proposed to remain as open space. Figure 1 maps the locations of 128 sample locations, 64 locations labeled as \"Sample Location Borrow\u201d and 64 locations labeled as \"Sample Location Fill\". Those locations identified as \"Sample Location Fill\u201d indicate the analytical result of the mercury concentration reported in mg/kg at the associated sample depth. The \"Sample Location Fill\u201d locations have no sample ID associated with them. The \"Sample Location Borrow\u201d locations have only a sample ID number associated with them. Sample concentrations have been associated with mapped locations using the report\u2019s summary tables. No geographic coordinates were provide by Converse Consultants in the narrative report or on the accompanying figure. Sample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy Figure 1 and matching to significant landmarks in the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u2019s parcel map. \n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nRecords with null values for mercury_results represent ND (non-detection). \n\nThe test pit location diagram (Figure 1) contains fewer sample locations than indicated in the results table (65 on the map, vs. 68 in the results table).\n\nNo results values were provided for fill samples, so those features are ommitted from this feature class. \n\nThe test pit location diagram contains duplicate sample IDs; some of these sample IDs do not match those in the table. The best efforts were made to match up the sample locations on the map with the correct results.\n",

Tentative map of planned subdivision residential parcel and planned infrastructure lay-out, Pezonella Associates March 28, 2003 letter report identifies the sample locations of the preliminary investigation by lot numbers identified on this tentative map. This tentative map was georeferenced and samples were located by arbitrarily placing the sample point at the centroid of lot sampled. Three control points were used in georeferencing with a first order polynomial transformation. For quality control, proposed lot boundaries on the tentative map were compared to existing parcel boundaries from the Lyon County Assessor\u2019s office. The lot numbers associated with each sample point correspond to the original lot numbers as identified in the \"Tentative Map for Santa Maria Ranch\", produced by Western Engineering and Surveying Services in 2003. Lot numbers have since changed. The current lot numbers are indicated in the Santa Maria Ranch Phase I Parcels feature class.",

             "description": "This feature class depicts the locations and analytical data for the soil samples taken by Converse Consultants in 2009. These samples represent a preliminary site characterization and the sample design was biased to the Town Ditch where it ran through the proposed development. Converse Consultants believed this diversion ditch represented a \"most likely\" source of contamination within the proposed development as it diverted water and sediment from the Carson River in vicinity of Winter Ranch. NDEP provided comment to the proposed sample design and additional sample locations were added. The following resources were used in compiling this dataset: Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., January 19, 2009, Soil Sampling, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C., Unpublished. Preliminary soil sampling conducted prior to development. Sampling in this investigation restricted to 9 locations located within the former Town Ditch. Two soil samples analyzed from each location representing 0 to 1ft below ground surface and 1 to 2 ft below ground surface. Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., June 30, 2009, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to David Friedman, NDEP, Unpublished. This letter transmits the GPS coordinates of the 9 locations of the soil samples collected from the Town Ditch and provides explanation of the sample design rationale as requested by NDEP. Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., December 10, 2009, Soil Sampling, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C., Unpublished. Preliminary soil sampling conducted prior to development. This report of a supplemental investigation to the work reported in the January 19, 2009 document. The supplemental study was conducted at the request of NDEP after reviewing the January 19, 2009 findings report and sample design rationale described by Converse Consultants in the June 30, 2009 letter. NDEP requested additional samples be collected from three other areas with potential contamination within the proposed SMR Phase II study area. These areas of suspected contamination include Daney Canyon drainage, the Carson River 100-year floodplain and the historic Ophir Mill site. Near surface soil samples collected near the Ophir Mill site with high levels of mercury detected were reported in the CRMS OU1 RI. Five additional locations were sampled in this supplemental study. Two soil samples analyzed from each location representing 0 to 1ft below ground surface and 1 to 2 ft below ground surface. GPS coordinates for the 5 additional locations were provided in this report. ",

             "description": "The primary purpose of the sediment collection was to obtain vertical profile information from several areas in which no data existed and/or to compare with existing data to demonstrate the mercury and metals deposition resulting from the Comstock-era release (i.e., beginning in the 1860s). The specific areas targeted in the field work were from the Lahontan Reservoir, Sheckler Lake, and downstream areas potentially impacted by the historic river flows prior to construction of Lahontan Reservoir.  In 2015, the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir were at historic low levels as a result of a four-year drought.  This presented the agency access to collect sediment core samples from areas that were normally below the waterline. EPA\u2019s principal study question was whether mercury is indeed sediment bound and that Lahontan Reservoir, since it construction in 1915, serves as a mercury sink.  The secondary purpose of the sediment sampling effort was to collect a range of mercury concentrations for assessing field screening equipment using Thermal Decomposition, Amalgamation, and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (See EPA SW7473) and comparing the results to laboratory analytical data.  The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

There are a total of 15 pairs of sister cities (31 total features) recognized in the U.S.-Mexico Border Program that span the entire length of the U.S.-Mexico border. These sister cities highlight the areas along the border that contain the most dense populations. Data was gathered by Jacoup Roiz from Google Maps GPS coordinates in 2019.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

USBR provided an information overview and reference source on mercury (Hg) in soils for water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. These data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan Reservoir area, focused on the camp sites and the beaches, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada.\n\nRunoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink. This area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow.\n\nWhen Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI, for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues. The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment. ",

Plans call for the program to be applied throughout the U.S. Initially, however, several pilot studies were established in diverse drainage basins to develop techniques for use in both groundwater and surface water studies. The Carson River Basin, Churchill and Lyon Counties, Nevada, is a  pilot study area for groundwater. The Carson River originates on the east flank of the Sierra Nevada mountains and drains eastward to terminate in the Carson Sink. This report presents data from that study.\n\nOne of the objectives of the study is to investigate the relationship between water quality and the composition of the solid mineral material in contact with the water. A regional assessment of the geochemistry of surficial materials was obtained by soil samples. Subsurface assessment was obtained from drill core of shallow (at least to the depth of the water table) wells drilled specifically for this study.\n\nBoth groundwater and solid materials were sampled, but this report contains the analytical data only for the solid mineral materials that were collected. All analyses were performed in laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Denver, CO.",

             "description": "The Carson River is a vital water resource for local municipalities and migratory birds travelling the Pacific Flyway. Historic mining practices that used mercury (Hg) to extract gold from Comstock Lode ore has left much of the river system heavily contaminated with Hg, a practice that continues in many parts of the world today.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2013, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) collected and analyzed Carson River water for Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations resulting in a sixteen-year record of unfiltered total mercury (uf.THg), filtered (dissolved) Hg (f.THg), total methylmercury(uf.MeHg), filtered MeHg (f.MeHg), and particulate-bound THg (p.THg) and MeHg (p.MeHg) concentrations. This represents one of the longest continuous records of Hg speciation data for any riverine system, thereby providing a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term trends in concentrations and annual loads. During the period of analysis, uf.THg concentration and load trended downward at rates of 0.85% and 1.8% per year, respectively. Conversely, the f.THg concentration increased at a rate of 1.7% per year between 1998 and 2005, and 4.9% per year between 2005 and 2013. Trends inflow-normalized partition coefficients for both Hg and MeHg suggest a statistically significant shift from the particulate to thefiltered phase. The upwardly accelerating f.THg concentration and observed shift from the solid phase tothe aqueous phase among the pools of Hg and MeHg within the river water column signals an increased risk of deteriorating ecological conditions in the lower basin with respect to Hg contamination.\n\nMore broadly, the 16-year trend analysis, completed 140 years after the commencement of major Hg releases to the Carson River, provides a poignant example of the ongoing legacy left behind by gold and silver mining techniques that relied on Hg amalgamation, and a cautionary tale for regions still pursuing the practice in other countries.  EPA funded work from 1997 through 2013.\n\nSamples were collected at the Weeks Bridge location from April 1997 through February 1999, and at seven other Carson River locations from April 1998 through February 1999, and at Weeks Bridge and below Lahontan Reservoir from 2000 through 2013.  Assist EPA in studying the transport of mercury-contaminated water and sediment in the Carson River system in western Nevada.  The study included periodic measurements of streamflow, and the collection and analysis of water samples for total mercury, methylmercury, and suspended sediment at two Carson River locations.

             "description": "The Carson River is a vital water resource for local municipalities and migratory birds travelling the Pacific Flyway. Historic mining practices that used mercury (Hg) to extract gold from Comstock Lode ore has left much of the river system heavily contaminated with Hg, a practice that continues in many parts of the world today.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2013, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) collected and analyzed Carson River water for Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations resulting in a sixteen-year record of unfiltered total mercury (uf.THg), filtered (dissolved) Hg (f.THg), total methylmercury(uf.MeHg), filtered MeHg (f.MeHg), and particulate-bound THg (p.THg) and MeHg (p.MeHg) concentrations. This represents one of the longest continuous records of Hg speciation data for any riverine system, thereby providing a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term trends in concentrations and annual loads. During the period of analysis, uf.THg concentration and load trended downward at rates of 0.85% and 1.8% per year, respectively. Conversely, the f.THg concentration increased at a rate of 1.7% per year between 1998 and 2005, and 4.9% per year between 2005 and 2013. Trends inflow-normalized partition coefficients for both Hg and MeHg suggest a statistically significant shift from the particulate to thefiltered phase. The upwardly accelerating f.THg concentration and observed shift from the solid phase tothe aqueous phase among the pools of Hg and MeHg within the river water column signals an increased risk of deteriorating ecological conditions in the lower basin with respect to Hg contamination.\n\nMore broadly, the 16-year trend analysis, completed 140 years after the commencement of major Hg releases to the Carson River, provides a poignant example of the ongoing legacy left behind by gold and silver mining techniques that relied on Hg amalgamation, and a cautionary tale for regions still pursuing the practice in other countries.  EPA funded work from 1997 through 2013.  Samples were collected at the Below Lahontan location from April 1997 through February 1999, and at seven other Carson River locations from April 1998 through February 1999, and at Weeks Bridge and below Lahontan Reservoir from 2000 through 2013.  Assist EPA in studying the transport of mercury-contaminated water and sediment in the Carson River system in western Nevada.\n\nThe study included periodic measurements of streamflow, and the collection and analysis of water samples for total mercury, methylmercury, and suspended sediment at two Carson River locations.  The study also included field measurements and the collection and analysis of samples from the north basin of Lahontan Reservoir.  EPA used the data to determine loadings of the dissolved and particulate fractions of total mercury and methylmercury into and from Lahontan Reservoir, to better understand sources and transformations of mercury in the Carson River system, evaluate the effects of reservoir stratification on methylmercury production, and ultimately to help determine whether remedial action is warranted to reduce the levels of mercury contamination in and near the Carson River. A journal article from Eric Morway, Carl Thodal and Mark Marvin-DiPascuale, USGS,  summarizing the findings is entitled \"Morway_Thodal_MMD_HgMeHg_2017.pdf\".  This study, a component of the Remedial Investigation for the Carson River Superfund Site, included collection and analysis of water samples for total mercury\u00a0and\u00a0methylmercury\u00a0from Weeks Bridge\u00a0above Lahontan Reservoir, located on the\u00a0Carson River.\n\nThe USGS Water Science Center has collected and analyzed water samples in the Carson River system through an Interagency Agreement with EPA. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.

             "description": "The primary purpose of the surface water collection was to correlate methylmercury information with sediment core data from several areas in which no data existed and/or to compare with existing data to demonstrate the mercury and metals deposition resulting from the Comstock-era release (i.e., beginning in the 1860s). The specific areas targeted in the field work were from the Lahontan Reservoir, Sheckler Lake, and downstream areas potentially impacted by the historic river flows prior to construction of Lahontan Reservoir.  In 2015, the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir were at historic low levels as a result of a four-year drought.  This presented the agency access to collect sediment core samples from areas that were normally below the waterline. EPA\u2019s principal study question was whether mercury is indeed sediment bound and that Lahontan Reservoir, since it construction in 1915, serves as a mercury sink.  The secondary purpose of the sediment sampling effort was to collect a range of mercury concentrations for assessing field screening equipment using Thermal Decomposition, Amalgamation, and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (See EPA SW7473) and comparing the results to laboratory analytical data.

Piedmont Engineering was contracted by NDEP to conduct an archeological survey of Comstock-era mining and milling features. These locations were obtained in order to define the investigation area boundaries of the Carson River Mercury Site. The field survey took place in 1993; NDEP later created the geospatial data representing the surveyed features. Additional features were added by NDEP using historical documents and aerial imagery.\n\nThe hardcopy Piedmont Engineering maps of Comstock-era mills and tailings sites were georeferenced by NDEP. Tailings polygons were digitized in ArcGIS Desktop. The original hardcopy maps were drawn at a scale of 1:2400 (written as 1\" = 200' in the maps).",

This study used the same base transect line (located north of the runway) created for the WCFS survey in 1997 so that any locations with detections could be spatially related to new detections. The event consisted of using portable hand-held augering equipment to collect soil samples from depths of 3 to 5 ft bgs. These samples were taken from areas that had been determined to have subsurface anomalies during the WCFS survey. A total of 37 soil samples were collected and analyzed for total PCBs, lead, chromium, cadmium, and mercury. No PCBs were detected in the soils above the detection limit of 2 mg/kg (URS, 1999). One sample showed elevated lead concentrations of 939 mg/kg. Baseline lead values were determined to be approximately 23.4 mg/kg in soil at Tern Island (URS, 1999).",

The service displays data derived from CAD data originally published in URS Greiner Woodward Clyde, 1999, Environmental Investigation: Former U.S. Coast Guard LORAN Station, Tern Island, French Frigate Shoals, Hawaii. URS Greiner Woodward Clyde (URSGWC) was retained by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) to conduct an environmental investigation at the former USCG long range navigation (LORAN) station on Tern Island. The investigation concentrated on the northwestern corner of Tern Island where the greatest environmental impact from the US military's past occupation of the island appears to have occurred. In addition, the map service displays FFS boundaries and points of interest, locations of marine debris removal by NOAA, mean biomass data, and locations of Tern Island buildings.",

Use of this product for Commercial Purposes by a person/company/organization for a profit or fee is strictly prohibited. This dataset cannot be re-sold. Please refer to the separately attached license from DigitalGlobe, Inc. for additional information. Digital orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a digital image with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary dynamic digital orthophoto is a 50 centimeter ground resolution, image cast to the customer specified projection and datum defined in the Spatial Reference Information section of this metadata document. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and ensure full coverage if the imagery is reprojected. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. DigitalGlobe WorldView-2 Satellite Orthoimagery was delivered to NOAA in GeoTIFF file format. This specific dataset was delivered to NOAA orthorectified to scale 1:12,000. This GeoTIFF composite contains the following four Multi-Spectral bands: Band 1: Blue (450 - 510 nm), Band 2: Green (510 - 580 nm), Band 3: Red (625 - 690 nm) and (585 - 625 nm) and Band 4: Color Infrared 1/NIR 1 (770 - 895 nm).",

The law requires facilities in certain industries, which manufacture, process, or use significant amounts of toxic chemicals, to report annually on their releases of these chemicals. The reports contain information about the types and amounts of toxic chemicals that are released each year to the air, water, and land as well as information on the quantities of toxic chemicals sent to other facilities for further waste management. All of this information is stored in the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) database. The data here represents facilities and chemical information that have been extracted from EPA TRIS system for reporting year 2012. The associated chemical data, table R9 TRI Chemicals 2012 is a one to many relationship.",

Six years of below normal precipitation left much of the reservoir dry during the summer, 1992, and allowed for the precise delineation and mapping of the stratigraphic units that underlie Lahontan Reservoir.\n\nThe units were defined on the basis of spatial and topographic position, grain-size, composition, and the presence or absence of weathering zones. Once delineated, the units were mapped on 1: 12,000 scale aerial photographs. Subsequently, the photographic data were transferred to a stable base map for interpretation and analysis. Twelve stratigraphic units have been defined, nine of which post-date dam construction in 1915. One post-dam unit was deposited by eolian processes, while the remaining eight represent sedimentation in three lacustrine depositional environments: coastal, deep-water, and deltaic.",

R9 tribal boundaries were acquired from the R9 Technology and Data Solutions Center are are based on data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Pacific Region Office and the AZ/NV Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Surface Management office. Tribal layers for both regions were merged and clipped to the border region for use in the U.S. - Mexico Border Program Application.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border.

Canneries thrive in this tiny U.S. territory because they allow Asian fishing companies to avoid U.S. import tariffs of up to 35 percent on processed fish. Goods have duty- and quota-free entry to the United States if 30 percent of their value is added in the territory. Federal law prohibits foreign commercial fishing vessels from offloading tuna at U.S. ports; however, American Samoa is exempted. Thus the greater part of the South Pacific tuna catch is landed here, supplying the United States with the bulk of its canned tuna, worth US$500 million a year. In aggregate, the canneries contribute about US$25 million a year to the local economy in wages, and spend another US$40 million on support services, fuel, and provisioning.",

These observations are organized according to the following map layers: Family Affairs Observations, Fleet Debris Levels, Return Vessels Special Reports, Roll Call Debris Data-Race, Special Report Debris-Race, Vessel Specific Observations, and Return Vessel Specific Levels Observations. The March, 2011 tsunami that affected northern Japan washed enormous amounts of debris out to sea. While most of this debris sank quickly out at sea, much remains on the surface and by ocean current and wind is working its way across the Pacific Ocean. In early days, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) could track the debris slick by satellite, but by early 2012, the debris had become too dispersed to track. News stories have reported containers with motorcycles on Haida Gwaii, whole fishing boats in Alaska, and sections of concrete dock in Oregon. Recent reports are about the struggles of local governments to deal with cleaning up and disposing of flotsam washing up on local beaches.",

             "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).\n\nAn incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.\n\nThe boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\n\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\n\nThe boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.\n\nNDEP extracted the Virginia City Census-Designated Place boundary polygon from the TIGER/Line database in 2020.",

List of dairies located in California that do not use anaerobic digesters to produce biogas, and estimates of how much biogas could be produced if these dairies were to use anaerobic digesters to manage dairy waste. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board provided EPA Region 9 with herd size data by from their 2005 General Waste Discharge annual report (contact person at the Water Quality Control Board: Doug Patterson, Doug.Patteson@waterboards.ca.gov). List of food processing facilities (in NV, AZ, CA, HI) producing waste that could be used for co-digestion at wastewater treatment facilities and other entities with anaerobic digesters. The facilities included were based on a list of businesses classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as food manufacturing businesses. Dunn and Bradstreet compiled the list in 2010 per the request by the EPA. List of Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) with anaerobic digesters in Arizona. The list of facilities was obtained from the annual biosolids report required under 40 CFR 503 (Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge) for WWTF with influent flows over 1 million gallons per day. Original data set was based on 2004 reporting, which was the last year Arizona WWTFs were required to report to the EPA, but was partially updated based on direct communication between EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program and some of the WWTFs.

California Organic Collection Programs: List of organic collection programs in California that have the potential to provide waste for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. A study conducted by New Found Lands Institute in 2008 with a grant provided by EPA Region 9 was the source of the information about organic collection programs. List of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) hauling and rendering companies serving locations in the State of California and that have the potential to provide FOG for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters.

USBR provided an information overview and reference source on mercury (Hg) in soils for water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. \n\nThese data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan spillway area, focused on the wetlands used by recreationalists and hunters, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the closed terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink.\n\nThis area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. This data was collected to help achieve goals set by the CWA that requires individual States to identify impaired water bodies and create enforceable WQ objectives to protect surface water quality within State bounds (CWA Sections 303d and 305 b).  These objectives were to focus on priority toxic pollutants, pursuant to CWA Section 307a. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.

Lead is a heavy metal that is often found in urban soil. It usually comes from sources such as chipped paint on pre-1978 housing, historic pollution from leaded gas, or lead recycling (smelting). Children exposed to lead can have health problems, including impaired brain and physical development. In June 2018, EPA and DTSC took soil samples in city-owned property along streets, not private property, at nearly 200 randomly selected locations across West Oakland. This area was selected because of its mix of possible sources of lead, including industry, older homes that may be painted with leaded paint and nearby freeways.",

Under the auspices of the Truckee-Carson-Pyramid Lake Water Settlement Agreement, the Department of the Interior has implemented a program to acquire rights for water to restore and maintain a portion of the historic wetlands in Lahontan Valley. Although inflow to wetlands will be partially restored, the effects of increased inflow to wetland contamination is uncertain.\n\nIn 1990, the Nevada State Office, in conjunction with Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), instituted a monitoring program on Stillwater NWR to assess implications of inorganic contaminants to fish, wildlife, and human health and to assess changes in inorganic contaminant concentrations in wetlands maintained With freshwater and agricultural drainage water. This program entailed the measurement of water quality parameters and the determination of trace element concentrations in water, sediment, and biological matrices. These data and the data tables provide results of the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge, Indian Lakes and Fallon National Wildlife Refuge, focused on the wetlands in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health and ecological exposure pathways.\n\nThe original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada.

             "description": "The current conceptual site model (CSM) includes data gaps related to the extent of mercury contamination throughout the site, as well as the presence of other metal contaminants in soil. This study focuses on three areas in OU01: the Six Mile Canyon Area in Dayton, NV, the California Pan Mill Area in Virginia City, NV, and the Sacramento Mill Area just north of Virginia City, NV.  Surface and near surface soils with COC concentration greater than the project action limits present a potential risk for direct contact and soil migration. Data gaps exist in the understanding the sources, extent, and migration pathways of contaminants at this area and the applicability of the Incremental Sampling (IS) and (X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) approach to comply with the LTSRP. The project will address these data gaps through incremental sampling and real time XRF.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the IS Study where field sample collection techniques were evaluated as part of this study using XRF. Sample processing included seiving, to compare ISM with the current LTSRP method based on four five-point composite samples per residential parcel. The goal to is to validate the CSM and improve the screening of vast areas of mercury-contaminated soils while continuing to evaluate the performance of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation for the simultaneous analysis of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) in soil affected by the mining operations associated with the Comstock Lode. however sample processing will be. The most effective processing and analytical techniques will be selected for use in a follow-up study which will evaluate field sample collection. It is anticipated that the most effective and efficient sampling and analysis techniques will be incorporated into future investigations for the Carson River area.\n\nGeneral Comments: The location coordinates represent the center point of the Decision Unit (DU) as calculated by GIS. For DUs that cross roads or driveways (SMCD2 and SMCSCR-South) the midpoint may plot in the middle of the road. The center point for SMCCBS was selected manually due to the unusual shape of the DU. The calculated GIS center point falls outside of the DU.  DU columns provided on each tab for easy sorting and QC check. It is not a critical data point since the DU name is embedded in the Sample ID. For Source Units (SU) samples, the DU column is N/A if the SU was located outside of a DU, this column is filled out if the SU was located inside of a DU. Date represents sample collection date.\n  \nTab-Specific Comments: XRF field results did not use unique Lab ID sample #s so left that column blank. Did not establish specific XRF reporting limits for this project. Manually added a \u201cU\u201d for the XRF ND samples to match the lab formats. Region 9 lab results for the XRF comparison samples: Left all the ICP metals in the database. R9 lab DMA data only reported Pb, As, Se, and Hg per the team decision. SPLP Extraction #2 results for the samples selected for leaching analysis - removed the rows that identify the extraction procedure and contained no lab data. SPLP Extraction #3 results for the samples selected for leaching analysis - removed the rows that identify the extraction procedure and contained no lab data. Notes column indicates this is DI water extraction.",

             "description": "CSO attributes and location information are from a variety of datasets for each state:\n\nConnecticut: Beginning with GIS data compiled by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (\u201cCT DEEP\u201d) and displayed on their CSO Right-to-Know site (https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Municipal-Wastewater/Combined-Sewer-Overflows-Right-to-Know), EPA filtered the data for the purposes of this map and made corrections based upon updated information available in EPA\u2019s files. EPA\u2019s map only displays municipalities with CSO outfalls, whereas CT DEEP\u2019s map includes municipalities with CSO-related bypasses at their Wastewater Treatment Facilities (but no Combined Sewer Collection System CSO outfalls). EPA\u2019s map only displays CSO outfalls \u2013 the point at which CSOs are discharged to the receiving water - whereas CT DEEP\u2019s map includes CSO regulators (the structure through which wastewater and stormwater exits the conveyance pipe towards the Wastewater Treatment Facility).\n\nMaine: Service containing both facility and outfall locations permitted under the Maine Pollution Elimination System (MEPDES) and administered by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP). The data has been collected using multiple methods over 2 decades under the direction of the Maine DEP GIS Unit. All location data was quality checked by MEDEP MEPDES Inspectors and GIS Unit staff in 2018.\n\nMassachusetts: Attribute and location information from a combination of MassDEP CSOs(https://mass-eoeea.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=08c0019270254f0095a0806b155abcde) (metadata - https://mass-eoeea.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0262b339c2c74213bdaaa15adccc0e96) and NPDES permits(https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/massachusetts-final-individual-npdes-permits).\n\nNew Hampshire: Active CSO outfalls collected from NH NPDES permits(https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/new-hampshire-final-individual-npdes-permits). EPA made corrections based upon updated information available in EPA\u2019s files.\n\nRhode Island: RI CSO Outfall Point Features. The outfalls managed by the Narragansett Bay Commission are downloadable from a GIS file through RIGIS (Rhode Island Geographic Information System https://www.rigis.org/datasets/nbc-sewer-overflows/explore?location=41.841121%2C-71.414224%2C13.57&showTable=true). Data was intended for use in utility facility engineering structure inventory. Last updated: 2019. Downloaded: 11/19/2021. Metadata (https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/2108bab269df47f988e59c18a556f37d/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html)\n\nVermont: Attribute and location information from Vermont Open Geodata Poral (https://geodata.vermont.gov/datasets/VTANR::stormwater-infrastructure-point-features/explore?location=43.912839%2C-72.414150%2C9.29). Point, line, and polygon data was collected and compiled through field observations, municipal member knowledge, ortho-photo interpretation, digitization of georeferenced town plans and record drawings, and state stormwater permit plans. Accuracy of all data is for planning purposes and field verification is at the user\u2019s discretion.

In general, all generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous waste are required to provide information about their activities to state environmental agencies. These agencies, in turn pass on the information to regional and national EPA offices. Accidents or other activities at facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes have sometimes led to the release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into soil, ground water, surface water, or air.
