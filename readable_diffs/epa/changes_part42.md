-            "description": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

-            "description": "Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

             "description": "This high-level metadata data document will be supplemented with detailed regional metadata at a later date. The NHDPlusV2 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). Interest in estimating stream flow volume and velocity to support pollutant fate-and-transport modeling was the driver behind the joint USEPA and USGS effort to develop the initial NHDPlus, referenced in this document as NHDPlusV1. NHDPlusV1 has been used in a wide variety of applications since its initial release in the fall of 2006. This widespread positive response prompted the multi-agency NHDPlus team to develop NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2). The NHDPlusV2 includes a stream network (based on the NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlusV2 also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the NHD network and building \"walls\" using the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The hydro-enforced digital elevation model (DEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the USGS, USEPA and contractors, has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process. The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by-flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; select a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes. The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and runoff distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs. NHDPlusV2 in CONUS contains a snapshot (2012) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved over the snapshot used in NHDPlusV1. These updates have not been stored in the central NHD repository at USGS. NHDPlusV2 in the islands is basin on a 2014/2015 snapshot of the 1:24,000 NHD. NHDPlusV2 users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlusV2 with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Updates to the 1:100,000-scale NHD snapshot should be sent to the USEPA as the primary steward. Updates to the 1:24,000-scale NHD shapshot should be sent to the USGS. Purpose: The geospatial data sets included in NHDPlusV2 are intended to support a variety of water-related applications. They already have been used in an application to develop estimates of mean annual streamflow and velocity for each NHDFlowline feature in the conterminous United States. The results of these analyses are included with the NHDPlusV2 data. NHDPlusV2 serves as the sample frame for the stream and lake surveys conducted by the USEPA under the National Aquatic Resources Surveys program. A water-quality model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) called SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes), can utilizes the NHDPlusV2 network functionality to track the downstream transport of nutrients, sediments, or other substances. NHDPlusV2 water bodies and estimates of streamflow and velocity are used in SPARROW to identify reservoir retention and in-stream loss factors. NHDPlusV2 climatic and land surface attributes can be used in SPARROW to identify potential factors in the delivery of nutrients from the land surface to streams. NHDPlusV2 data is also being used in select areas for a USGS Web-based application, called StreamStats. StreamStats provides tools to interactively select any point in the implemented areas, delineate watersheds, and to obtain streamflow and watershed characteristics for the selected point. NHDPlusV2 has been designed to accommodate many users' needs for future applications. NHDPlusV2 provides the framework and tools necessary to customize the behavior of the network relationships as well as building upon the attribute database, for which the user can assign their own data to the network.",

These waters were listed by the state as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The status of TMDLs were also tracked. TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. Under Section 305(b) of the CWA, the states, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United States are required to submit reports on the quality of their waters to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) every 2 years.",

Combined sewer systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. Most of the time, combined sewer systems transport all of their wastewater to a sewage treatment plant, where it is treated and then discharged to a water body. During periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt, however, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant. For this reason, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess untreated wastewater directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.

The REAP divides eighteen individual measures into three main sub-layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This geodatabase contains the composite of these three layers. There are 2 composite grids within this geodatabase (composite & composite rank). The composite grid results from the sum of the 3 sub-layers with scores ranging from 3 to 300. The higher scores represent areas that may be of a higher ecological importance. The compositerank grid represents a ranking of the scores in the composite grid. Each cell is placed into 1 of the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (top 1% of scores), 10 (top 10% of scores), 25 (top 25% of scores), 50 (top 50% of scores), and 100 (the bottom 50% of scores).

There are three measures that make up the diversity layer: appropriateness of land cover, contiguous size of undeveloped area, and the Shannon land cover diversity index. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the three measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more diverse. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least diverse. In the diversityrank grid, the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (top 1% of scores), 10 (top 10% of scores), 25 (top 25% of scores), 50 (top 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores).

This report summarizes the analytical and field results from a pilot investigation performed to assess mercury contamination. Understanding the sources and transformations of mercury aided in planning future RI activities and pilot studies to assess mercury fate and transport in the Carson River and the Lahontan Reservoir. Soil samples from erosional banks along a 4-mile segment of the Carson River upstream of the Lahontan Reservoir were collected and analyzed in this pilot investigation to characterize mercury variability in exposed banks prone to erosion. This report presents the following information: Results of soil sampling and analysis, evaluation of data quality and compliance with the field sampling plan (FSP), discussion of the data, conclusions and recommendations for further study.  The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

             "description": "As a component of the ecological assessment for the Carson River Mercury Site, EPA conducted a survey of benthic macroinvertebrates to evaluate the potential adverse effects of mercury in surface water and sediment of the Carson River. Measures of benthic community response to mercury contamination derived from the benthic survey are presented in this the EcoRisk Assessment, Appendix C. A characterization of the existing environment at the sampling locations-including the habitat characteristics, fish and wildlife populations, and surrounding land use.\n\n    Rapid BioAssessment Protocol II (RBP) involves the standardized collection, enumeration, and identification of major benthic taxa to the family level in riffle/run habitats. Standard data sheets are used to record results at each sampling. location. Collections are compared to a reference location, and an evaluation is made as to the impairment, or lack thereof, of the benthic community from stressors within the watershed.\n\n    The biological condition of the community can be ranked according to three categories of impact: nonimpaired, moderately impaired, or severely impaired, where the degree of impairment implies less than optimal community structure, the loss of intolerant species, and dominance by a few tolerant taxa compared to background. RBP II also involves assessment of habitat characteristics such as stream flow, bottom conditions, and riparian vegetation. In addition, standard water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, color, and turbidity are determined. The RBP II was conducted on August 17 and 18, 1994 during a period of drought. ",

Dairy waste threatens the quality of drinking water for up to 20 million Californians. The pollution created by dairies comes primarily from manure. Across California, dairy cows create more than 65 billion pounds of manure per year. Even when excess manure is used as fertilizer, this waste runs off fields into California's waterways, eventually contaminating aquatic habitats and public water sources. A major source of reactive organic gases, dairy manure also contributes to air pollution.",

An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Carson River Estates subdivision is located within Operable Unit 1 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS). Parcel boundaries were extracted from the Lyon County parcels layer, and then attributed with information pertaining to the environmental covenant (if applicable).",

             "description": "For the Ecological Risk Assessment Report, EPA collected these samples, consisting of benthic invertebrates (crayfish), from three contaminated locations in the Carson River upstream from Lahontan Reservoir (Santiago Ruins, Dayton State Park, and Fort Churchill) and one background location (Ruhenstroth Dam).  As a component of the ecological assessment for the Carson River Mercury Site, a survey of benthic macroinvertebrates was conducted to evaluate the potential adverse effects of mercury in surface water and sediment of the Carson River. Measures of benthic community response to mercury contamination derived from the benthic survey are presented in this the EcoRisk Assessment, Appendix C. A characterization of the existing environment at the sampling locations-including the habitat characteristics, fish and wildlife populations, and surrounding land use.\n\nRapid BioAssessment Protocol II (RBP) involves the standardized collection, enumeration, and identification of major benthic taxa to the family level in riffle/run habitats. Standard data sheets are used to record results at each sampling. location. Collections are compared to a reference location, and an evaluation is made as to the impairment, or lack thereof, of the benthic community from stressors within the watershed. The biological condition of the community can be ranked according to three categories of impact: nonimpaired, moderately impaired, or severely impaired, where the degree of impairment implies less than optimal community structure, the loss of intolerant species, and dominance by a few tolerant taxa compared to background. RBP II also involves assessment of habitat characteristics such as stream flow, bottom conditions, and riparian vegetation. In addition, standard water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, color, and turbidity are determined.\n\nThe RBP II was conducted on August 17 and 18, 1994 during a period of drought. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU1 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 1994) as well as the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), describing the nature and extent of contamination from the Site, primarily the Ecological Risk Assessment Report.  The RI report also contains the Human Health Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

Forty one (41) aerial radiological surveys of potential uranium mining areas (1,144 square miles) were conducted within the Navajo Nation during the period from October 1994 through October 1999. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region 9 funded the surveys and the US Department of Energy (USDOE) Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSL) in Las Vegas, Nevada conducted the aerial surveys. The aerial survey data were used to characterize the overall radioactivity (ground surface exposure rate) and excess Bismuth 214 levels within the surveyed areas.",

Excess Bismuth 214 is based upon measured minus expected Bismuth 214 times a per flight determined constant equal to a ratio of statistically most likely values. Forty one (41) aerial radiological surveys of potential uranium mining areas (1,144 square miles) were conducted within the Navajo Nation during the period from October 1994 through October 1999. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region 9 funded the surveys and the US Department of Energy (USDOE) Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSL) in Las Vegas, Nevada conducted the aerial surveys. The aerial survey data were used to characterize the overall radioactivity (ground surface exposure rate) and excess Bismuth 214 levels within the surveyed areas.",

             "description": "This is a summary of mercury (Hg) data from fish collected in the Lahontan Reservoir area of the Carson River Basin.   NDOW collected the fish and the EPA Region 9 Laboratory analyzed the tissue for mercury (Hg) for EPA's Impaired Waters Program, water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. These data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan Reservoir area, used by recreationalists and fishermen, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.\n\nThe elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink. This area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink.\n\nThe EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

             "description": "EPA has collected soil, sediment, surface water and biota data to complete the remedial investigation (RI) at the Operable Unit (OU) No. 2 of the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site (CRMS). The goal of the study is to select a remedy that eliminates, reduces, or controls risks from site-related compounds of concern to human health and the environment.  Specifically, the RI involves the investigation and study of the heavy metals contamination and the associated tributaries into the Carson River watershed resulting from site-related contaminant migration and to evaluate past and current releases and their impact to human health and the environment.\n\n    The Site includes mercury-contaminated soils at former mill sites, mercury contamination in waterways adjacent to the mill sites, and mercury contamination in sediments and banks fish and wildlife over more than a 80 mile length of the River, beginning near Carson City, Nevada and extending downstream to the Lahontan Valley and ultimately at its terminus at the USFWS Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. Contamination at the Site is a legacy of the Comstock mining era of the late 1860s, when mercury was imported to the area for processing of gold and silver ore. Ore mined from the Comstock Lode was transported to the mill sites, where it was crushed and mixed with mercury to amalgamate the precious metals (Washoe Process). The mills were primarily located in Virginia City, Silver City, Gold Hill, Dayton, Six Mile Canyon, Gold Canyon, and adjacent to the Carson River between New Empire and Dayton. During the mining era, an estimated 7,500 tons of mercury were discharged into the River drainage, primarily in the form of mercury-contaminated tailings.",

Incremental samples were collected from three separate areas within the CRMS: Six Mile Canyon Area near Mark Twain, NV; California Pan Mill in Virginia City, NV; and Sacramento Mill in Virginia City, NV. The purpose of the data collection was to help characterize the extent of Hg, Pb, and As in surface (0 to 6-inch) and in some locations subsurface (0 to 24-inch) soils in the three study areas. A secondary purpose of the study was to demonstrate incremental sampling techniques and field XRF analysis to EPA Region 9 and NDEP Staff. The XRF results columns in the attribute table were generated by XRF data collected in accordance with the EPA-Approved Quality Assurance Project Plan and are considered definitive results suitable for project decisions. 30-point incremental samples were sieved to the 100-mesh fraction, placed \u201cinterference free\u201d XRF read bags, and analyzed with EPA Headquarters\u2019 Niton XRF. At least two XRF measurements were collected on each side of the bag resulting in at least four readings that were used to calculate the sample bag average that appears in the XRF Results columns for Hg, Pb, and As. If triplicate results were collected for a given sample, the mean is reported in the XRF Results columns for Hg, Pb, and As and the results for each of the three replicates are detailed in the XRF Notes column.",

More specifically, it contains reach codes for networked features and isolated lakes, flow direction, names, stream level, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined to represent water bodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

             "description": "USGS conducted preliminary assays on aged (3 mo.) surface sediment (0-4 cm) collected from 13 sites during October 1998 in order to decipher general spatial trends in Hg-speciation, microbiology and relevant biogeochemistry. During the second field campaign sample processing and incubations were conducted at ambient temperature within hours of sediment collection to provide a more accurate measure of in-situ process rates and analyte concentrations. The third field sampling (October 1999), involving 14 sampling and was conducted with a similar approach as in June 1999. The latter two data sets provide a direct seasonal comparison (summer/fall, high/lo flow conditions) of Hg transformation dynamics in the CRS. Sediment depth profiles (0-16 cm) were investigated at four sites during June 1999 and at two of these four during October 1999. Eroding vertical bank material was sampled in the Hg-contaminated Fort Churchill region during both 1999 dates. Laboratory experiments were conducted using sediment collected during the latter two sampling dates.\n\nThe study purpose sought to: a) identify important zones of net methylmercury (MeHg) production and consumption within the CRS, b) determine which environmental factors most strongly influence these processes and c) provide estimates of seasonal variability. Measurements were made of microbial Hg-transformations (via radiotracer) and in-situ Hg speciation (total mercury (Hgt), MeHg, and particle-associated acid-extractable Hg(II)). Acid extractable Hg(II) was used as a surrogate measure for the Hg(II) most readily available to bacteria for methylation. A novel Hg-biosensor technique was also used to assess bioavailable Hg(II) in pore-water. A suite of ancillary microbial processes and sediment geochemical parameters were also measured to more fully characterize each site, and to relate these measurements to observed Hg-transformation rates and Hg-speciation.\n\nThe EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

             "description": "The Region 9 CRMS risk assessor specifically identified the need to obtain data for Tribal lands near Fallon, Nevada.  Based on a 1994 study performed on OU1 samples, an estimated 12% of total mercury measurements is mercuric chloride (HgCl2).  The Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) summarized the OU1 historical analytical approaches for \u201cspeciation\u201d with currently available methods summarized.  Based on team scoping meeting with EPA Region 10 and the Region 9 Toxicologist, use of the Brooks Applied Lab (BRL) sequential extraction was selected primarily for reasons of comparability of approaches to simplify data assessment.  (EPA Method 3200 was presented for comparative purposes.)\n\nThere are significant sources of uncertainty in \u201cspeciation\u201d using any approach, as each is technically a procedurally defined fractionation that may include other mercury species not specifically identified.  As an example of this uncertainty, under the OU1 study of the EPA Las Vegas Lab data, it was unclear which fraction would have captured mercury oxide or whether the residual chlorides caused minor amounts of sulfide to combine with the nitric acid fraction. While the Oak Ridge approach may have reported mercuric chloride in the elemental mercury fraction.\n\nThe primary factors driving the need for this speciation data were uncertainty about the quality of the historical OU1 data; applicability of the OU1 data at the locations below Lahontan Reservoir, and concerns expressed by the Region 9 CRMS risk assessor to better obtain direct measurement data near the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe.  The data generated by this sampling were reviewed for laboratory quality control but decisions with the data were made by the EPA Region 9 CRMS risk assessor.\n",

             "description": "This feature class depicts Comstock-era mill locations within the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS). These locations were obtained in order to define the investigation area boundaries of Operable Unit 1 (OU1) within CRMS. Completion of this dataset took place over several years and phases, as described below. \n\nEPA survey:\nThe first mill survey took place in 1993 by EPA, contracted by Piedmont Engineering.113 mills were identified in this survey. Later, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) conducted historic research on Comstock-era mills to expand upon this dataset, identifying an additional 87 mill sites, bringing the total number of mills in the dataset to 200. This process is described below.\n\nNDEP Historical Research:\nMill site locations were determined based on georeferenced maps procured from the EPA, NDEP, Storey County and the UNR digital map library. All maps were georeferenced based on available landmarks by heads-up digitizing techniques. The maps utilized had varying degrees of accuracy based on their date of production. Some maps utilized dated back to the 1860's.\nOnce all historic maps were scanned, imported and georeferenced, all map sources were evaluated and mill site locations were digitized based on the preponderance of evidence (by comparing mill locations as shown on the various source maps) to determine each mill's location.\n\nA vector layer of mill sites was thus constructed using georeferenced raster layer resources. This layer of mill sites contains the locations of 188 historic Comstock Era mills as well as 12 additional tailings locations that are not directly associated with a mill site. 33 additional sites were identified; these consisted of sites that were known to exist but not located on historic maps, as well as cyanide mills. \n\nBroadbent and Associates, Inc. field surveys:\nIn 2012 NDEP contracted Broadbent and Associates, Inc. to survey all mill sites defined in this dataset. The contractor successfully verified the remains and evidence of 73 mills. Inconclusive mill evidence was found for 98 of the sites in the dataset. For 65 mill sites, the contractor was not given permission by the landowner to access the property and therefore the mill site location was not surveyed. Survey status is unknown for 1 mill.\n\nThe contractor provided a feature class of all 236 mills accompanied by a detailed report on their survey efforts, listed below:\nBroadbent and Associates, Inc., Eric M. Seitz, Project Manager. January 31, 2013, Final Report \u2013 Comstock Archaeological Mill Site Inventory, Unpublished. \n\nNDEP reviewed this report and the associated feature class to confirm each mill point location and provide attribute information on the survey status of each mill site. NDEP added the attrtibute field \"Field Verified\" to provide information on the field verification status of each site. A value of \"No\" indicates the site was not surveyed in the field. This was due to to access limitations and denials for sites located on private property. A value of \"Yes\" indicates the site was surveyed and evidence of the mill was found. A value of \"Surveyed\" indicates the site was surveyed but inconclusive or little evidence of a mill was found.\n",

The information contained in MRDS was intended to reflect the reports used as sources and is current only as of the date of those source reports. Consequently MRDS does not reflect up-to-date changes to the operating status of mines, ownership, land status, production figures and estimates of reserves and resources, or the nature, size, and extent of workings.

The MRDS is a large and complex relational database developed over several decades by hundreds of researchers and reporters. While database records describe mineral resources worldwide, the compilation of information was intended to cover the United States completely, and its coverage of resources in other countries is incomplete. The content of MRDS records was drawn from reports previously published or made available to USGS researchers. Some of those original source materials are no longer available. The information contained in MRDS was intended to reflect the reports used as sources and is current only as of the date of those source reports. Consequently MRDS does not reflect up-to-date changes to the operating status of mines, ownership, land status, production figures and estimates of reserves and resources, or the nature, size, and extent of workings. Information on the geological characteristics of the mineral resource are likely to remain correct, but aspects involving human activity are likely to be out of date.",

An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Onda Verde subdivision is located within Operable Unit 2 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS).",

URS submitted a draft SAP to NDEP for review and incorporated NDEP\u2019s comments in the Final SAP. In October and November 2011, URS performed a Phase II ESA on the Site. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate if impacts related to the CRMS are present on the 138 undeveloped residential lots and one partially developed lot. The lots subject to the Phase II ESA were owned by two separate entities and the Phase II ESA was divided accordingly. Section I: URS sampled lots 2 - 160, located in the westernmost section of the subdivision. Samples took place between 10/24/2011 and 11/2/2011. The sample date in the attribute table indicates the last date in the sampling period for this segment. Section 2: URS Corporation sampled lots M41 - M86, located in the easternmost section of the subdivision. Samples took place between 10/26/2011 and 11/1/2011. The sample date in the attribute table indicates the last date in the sampling period for this segment. Sample locations were collected using a Trimble GeoXT GPS unit. Analytical data for each sample point is contained with the related table, OndaVerde_SampleResults. Parameters sampled include mercury, arsenic, and lead.

             "description": "This feature class depicts the boundaries of Operable Unit 1 (OU1) within the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS), including the four Area of Investigation boundaries.\n\nNDEP lead an initiative to refine the boundaries shown on maps identifying the Carson River Mercury Superfund Site (CRMS) from the initial site identification and description as the Carson River hydrographic basin beginning in Carson City, NV to its terminal points in Churchill County, NV. This description of the CRMS was used in many of the early site investigation studies and reports and continued to be used in all public education and long-term site management controls until approximately 2012. Using site contaminant fate and transport determinations from the CRMS OU1 Remedial Investigation (RI) and Conceptual Site Model (CSM), it seemed inappropriate to include the much larger area of the hydrographic basin as being potentially impacted by site contaminants of concern (CoC). NDEP created protocols to estimate areas that are likely to have been impacted by CoCs and created maps using these protocols to redraw the CRMS boundary limits.\n \nIn the development of these protocols, NDEP used: \nHistoric records and documentation of probable source areas; The 2012 archaeological mill site research and field study conducted by Broadbent and Associates to locate the historic source areas; Soil and sediment transport mechanisms identified in the CSM and general soil transport and sedimentology principals to predict areas where CoCs have likely been located at and downstream of the historic sources. \n\nThe overall area of transport was estimated to be reasonably large to include possible anthropogenic activity as well as historic and future natural events such as flooding and channel migration. Additionally, NDEP added a \"buffer\u201d to extend the potential areas beyond the conservatively defined primary areas of potential contamination to further address unknown and future effects. These buffers have been identified separately from the primary areas of concern and labeled as such on maps using these protocols. These revisions were formalized in the 2013 Explanation of Significant Differences to the OU-1 Record of Decision (RoD) to adopt the new site definition and boundaries identified by NDEP as new estimates of the CRMS extents. \n\nNDEP identified four geographic areas of prime importance to the CRMS. Originally labeled by NDEP as \"Risk Areas\u201d, the intent of this terminology was to indicate these were the areas understood to have the most likely \"risk\u201d of contamination. Under consultation with EPA R9 risk assessment staff, the term has been changed to \"Area of Investigation\u201d to avoid confusion that any actual quantitative level of human or ecological risk has been determined for these areas. They are only estimates of potential contamination and new or additional information that contradicts these boundaries as being insufficient will be used to adopt new boundaries as appropriate. The four Areas of Investigation have become the foundation for the residential soil sampling program mandated by the OU-1 RoD. Summarized briefly; \n\nInvestigation Area 1 (IA 1)- This includes all areas in the Carson River drainage basin from about the area of the historic settlement of Empire in Carson City, NV downstream to the existing or historic terminal points of the river at Carson Lake, Carson Sink, Indian Lakes and the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge that lie outside the buffer zones of the other three Investigation Areas. It is least probable that CRMS CoCs will be located in these areas. It is unlikely that any sampling will be requested on areas developed within IA 1, but it might be requested in special circumstances, especially near and around the source areas of the contamination where historic activities could potentially have caused contamination beyond the typical boundaries as identified by the CSM. \n\nInvestigation Area 2 (IA 2)- This area is defined as a buffer that lies 100 feet along a normal horizontal to the Investigation Area 3 boundary. For Comstock-era mill sites and isolated tailings piles, this translates to the area between 350 feet and 450 feet from the center point of the historic feature. For the 100-year FEMA floodplain and areas of irrigation, this is the area beginning at the limit of the flood plain boundary or irrigated land along a normal to 100 feet. \n\nInvestigation Area 3 (IA 3)- This area is defined as a buffer that lies 100 feet along a normal horizontal to the Investigation Area 4 boundary for Comstock-era mills or isolated tailings piles. For Comstock-era mill sites and isolated tailings piles, this translates to the area between 250 feet and 350 feet from the center point of the historic feature. It is also defined as the limits of the FEMA 100-year floodplain or past or current flood irrigation practices. A tributary of the Carson River must have a Comstock-era mill site or tailings pile located along it to be mapped in IA3 and only the portion of the tributary downstream of the historic feature is included, not including the IA3 area and buffer drawn around the historic feature itself. If a tributary does not have FEMA 100-year flood plain defined, then IA3 has been defined as the area 100 feet along a normal to Investigation Area 4 boundary of that tributary. \n\nInvestigation Area 4 (IA 4)- This area represents the highest likelihood of mercury contamination. Multiple steps were used to define the extent of this area, described below: \n\nThe area within a 250 feet radius from the center point of a Comstock-era mill \nComstock-era tailings pile polygon with a 250 ft buffer \nThe centerline of the current channel of the Carson River enclosed in a polygon 100-feet wide (50 feet either side). \nTributaries to the Carson River, where Comstock-era mills and tailings piles were located are enclosed in a polygon 50-feet wide (25 feet either side) from the approximate center of the tributary channel. \nIrrigation canals are enclosed in a polygon 20 feet wide (10 feet either side) from the approximate center of the ditch.\n\n",
