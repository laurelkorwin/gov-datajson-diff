Curations include information regarding the study design, chemical identity, dosing, treatment group parameters, treatment-related (significantly different from control) and critical (adverse) effects for all dose treatment groups, as well as endpoint testing status according to guideline specifications. \nToxRefDB data was examined for all subchronic (SUB) studies with complete curations, which included registrant-submitted toxicity studies from the US EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) and guideline studies sourced from the National Toxicology Program (NTP). \n\nStatistically significant differences between treatment and control group data at p<0.05 within the source documents was extracted and denoted with a \u201ctreatment-related\u201d Boolean indicator \u201ctrue\u201d. Across the studies with absolute liver weights and relative-to-body (RLW) liver weights, the treatment-related mean effect values at the lowest effect (LE) dose levels as well as mean control liver weights were determined for all chemical-study-sex-species-exposure route groupings. The LE-ALW and LE-RLW changes were quantified as effect size differences from control using the following equation:\nEffect_size = 100 x (LE Effect_value \u2013 Control Effect_Value) / Control Effect_Value\n\nAny microscopic liver pathology effects occurring at the corresponding LE dose level of weight change were also identified and listed in the dataset. Histopathology terms were presented as they appeared in ToxRefDB without harmonizing different hierarchical levels and aggregating multiple terms used to depict the same lesions.\nThe final dataset that includes chemical stressor information, study source identifiers, study type, sex, species, strain, administration route, administration method, dose level, mg/kg/day value, qualitative and quantitative effect information, effect size from control, and pathology effects if present. The dataset includes data from 389 subchronic studies on 273 chemicals. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMezencev, R., M. Feshuk, L. Kolaczkowski, G. Peterson, Q. Zhao, S. Watford, and J. Weaver.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset estimates the average agricultural buffer width, the percentage of agricultural lands with flow paths that would intersect natural land cover before reaching a stream, and the percentage of each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that is unbuffered agricultural land. Subwatershed summaries are calculated for the contiguous United States. The map uses a combined land use/land cover map from the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL). It combines agriculture, forests, grasslands and wetlands with stream networks and elevation datasets in flow path models to find agricultural flow paths that do or do not intersect buffers, and counts the agricultural flow paths through buffers adjacent to streams in order to determine average buffer widths on agricultural lands. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "The national agricultural water demand metric provides insight into the amount of water used for agricultural irrigation in the contiguous United States. The estimates are derived from a water usage rate per 30m cell based on 2010 irrigation water use; an indication of agricultural irrigation based on 2011 crop, 2011 land use, and 2007/2012 remotely sensed irrigation; and summarized by watershed or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). Agricultural irrigation water use, as defined in this case, meets a variety of needs before, during, and after growing seasons (e.g., dust suppression, field preparation, chemical application, weed control, salt removal from root zones, frost protection, crop cooling, and harvesting). Estimates include self-supplied surface and groundwater, as well as supplies from irrigation-specific organizations (e.g., companies, districts, cooperatives, government). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Values are provided for total oxidized nitrogen (HNO3, NO, NO2, N2O5, NH3, HONO, PAN, organic nitrogen, and particulate NO3), oxidized nitrogen wet deposition, oxidized nitrogen dry deposition, total reduced nitrogen (NH3 and particulate NH4), reduced nitrogen dry deposition, reduced nitrogen wet deposition, total dry nitrogen deposition, total wet nitrogen deposition, total nitrogen deposition (wet+dry), total sulfur (SO2 + particulate SO4) dry deposition, total sulfur wet deposition, and total sulfur deposition.  The dataset is based on output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) run using the bidirectional flux option for the 12-km grid size for the US, Canada, and Mexico. The CMAQ output has been post-processed to adjust the wet deposition for errors in the location and amount of precipitation and for regional biases in the TNO3 (HNO3 + NO3), NHx (NH4 + NH3), and sulfate wet deposition.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset demonstrates the effect of changes in pollution concentration on local populations in 750 block groups in Austin, Texas. The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Residential water use reporting in the EnviroAtlas-defined study area is available through the Texas Water Development Board.

A potential view of water is defined as having a body of water that is greater than 300m2 within 50m of a residential location. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home. The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015 version) map.

The values were estimated from maps produced by the PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University. The original data was at the scale of 800 m grid cells representing average precipitation from 1981-2010 in mm. The data was converted to inches of precipitation and then zonal statistics were estimated for a final value of average annual precipitation for each 12 digit HUC.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 24 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrate species.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Biodiversity Metrics by 12-digit HUC for the Southwestern United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and the US Geological Survey (USGS) to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, as well as a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. The EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, the community level domestic water use is calculated per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). Water use in this EnviroAtlas-defined study area is estimated at 67-86 GPD across three counties. It was calculated as a weighted average of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water Use estimates for public-supplied and self-supplied use according to population. The dasymetric data is a geospatial distribution of population across the landscape. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "The Birmingham, AL EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 2,778 km2 around the city of Birmingham and portions of surrounding counties. The area classified is based on the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Area for Birmingham, AL with a 1 km buffer added. This area includes the majority of Jefferson County and a large percentage of Shelby County, as well as very small portions of Bibb, Blount, Chilton, and St. Clair counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) that were collected in summer 2011. LiDAR datasets collected in 2010, 2011 and 2013 were also used to create this MULC. Six land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were obtained from the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 500 completely random and 95 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded an overall user's accuracy of 83.4% (MAX) and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy of 87.6% (RIGHT) (see confusion matrices below). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University (NMSU), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for bird species. Metrics include all bird species richness, lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by the Center for Applied Spatial Ecology, New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit (NMCFWRU), NMSU to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Intersections are defined as any point where 3 or more roads meet and density is calculated using kernel density, where closer intersections are weighted higher than further intersections. Intersection density is highly correlated with walking for transportation. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "The Baltimore, MD EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 4,545 km2 around the city of Baltimore and portions of surrounding counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and infrared light) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints). Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees, Grass/Herbaceous, Agriculture, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer from the years 1981, 1999, and 2013 (http://wetlands.fws.gov). An analysis of about 600 completely random and 90 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 90% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 93% within the census block group boundary (see confusion matrices below). These data were developed as part of the Chesapeake Bay High-Resolution Land Cover Project, a cooperative agreement between the Chesapeake Conservancy and the National Park Service, funded through an interagency agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Chesapeake Conservancy, under the direction of Margaret Markham, created the initial statewide 1-meter land cover data. EPA added agriculture and wetlands taken from ancillary data sources. See detailed processing steps and workflow below.

The road width is estimated for each road and percent tree cover is calculated in a 8.5 meter strip beginning at the estimated road edge. Percent tree cover is calculated for each block between road intersections. In this community, tree cover is defined as Trees & Forest and Woody Wetlands. Tree cover provides valuable benefits to neighborhood residents and walkers by providing shade, improved aesthetics, and outdoor gathering spaces. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Biological nitrogen fixation in natural/semi-natural ecosystems by 12-digit HUC for the Conterminous United States, 2006",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean biological nitrogen fixation in natural/semi-natural ecosystems per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated using a correlation with actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999). AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation describing the correlation of AET with climate (average annual daily temperature, average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual maximum daily temperature, and annual precipitation) and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous US (Sanford and Selnick 2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum daily temperatures and total precipitation for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM climate dataset (http://prism.oregonstate.edu). Average annual climate data were then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html; 22 March 2011 release) using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0. AET for individual HUC12s was estimated using equations described in Sanford and Selnick (2013). BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled with an equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and actual evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion of non-developed and non-agricultural land in the HUC12. The first half of the equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the central and high estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that suggest that natural BNF rates are less than previous estimates based on scaled-up estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The land use/land cover modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We believe it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with large proportions of urban or agricultural development. These data represent an average N input to individual HUC12s, i.e., they are not specific to an individual land use type within the HUC12.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Per capita water use within the EnviroAtlas-defined study area is available through the Texas Water Development Board. The estimated water use per capita per day in Brownsville in 2015 was 101 gallons. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Ten land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees, shrubs, grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation, agriculture, orchards, woody wetland, and emergent wetland. An accuracy assessment of 704 completely random and 24 stratified random photo-interpreted reference points yielded an overall accuracy of 82 % (fuzzy) and 77% (non-fuzzy).

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Cultivated biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural lands by 12-digit HUC in the Conterminous United States, 2006",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean cultivated biological nitrogen fixation (C-BNF) in cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Nitrogen (N) inputs from the cultivation of legumes, which possess a symbiotic relationship with N-fixing bacteria, were calculated with a recently developed model relating county-level yields of various leguminous crops with BNF rates. We accessed county-level data on annual crop yields for soybeans (Glycine max L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), various dry beans (Phaseolus, Cicer, and Lens spp.), and dry peas (Pisum spp.) for 2006 from the USDA Census of Agriculture (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). We estimated the yield of the non-alfalfa leguminous component of hay as 32% of the yield of total non-alfalfa hay (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). Annual rates of C-BNF by crop type were calculated using a model that relates yield to C-BNF. We assume yield data reflect differences in soil properties, water availability, temperature, and other local and regional factors that can influence root nodulation and rate of N fixation. We distributed county-specific, C-BNF rates to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands delineated in the 2006 National Land Cover Database (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county. C-BNF data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset consists of the 2010 Puerto Rico and 2012 U.S. Virgin Islands C-CAP (Coastal Change Analysis Program) rasters, modified for use in EnviroAtlas. The original C-CAP rasters were produced by the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Office for Coastal Management. In the EnviroAtlas version, the C-CAP rasters have been mosaicked together. Fields containing equivalent NLCD (National Land Cover Database) classes have been added so that processes used to develop NLCD-based EnviroAtlas datasets can be more easily applied to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; the colormap has also been modified to match the NLCD colormap.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Local use data, as prepared for several cities for the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and at the county level by USGS, were used. Within the Chicago study area, the 1998-2010 average estimates ranged from 33 to 196 GPD.

The study area spans 10 counties (7 in Illinois, 3 in Indiana). These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints). Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, Agriculture, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 600 completely random and 97 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 81% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 87% (see confusion matrices below).

             "description": "The Cleveland, OH EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 2,737 km2 around the city of Cleveland and portions of surrounding counties. The area classified is based on the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Area for Cleveland, OH with a 1 km buffer added. This area includes the majority of Cuyahoga and Lake Counties, and portions of Ashtabula, Geauga, Medina, Lorain, Portage and Summit Counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) in 2011 and 2013. The NAIP imagery was collected on several dates: August 12, 2011, September 03, 2011 and August 24, 2013. The data was comprised of 85% 2011 NAIP and 15% 2013 NAIP imagery. LiDAR data collected between March 18, 2006 and May 07, 2006 covered the entire study area. Six land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were copied from the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer from 2006. An analysis of 500 completely random and 81 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded an overall user's accuracy of 86.2% (see confusion matrix below).

Tree cover provides valuable benefits to neighborhood residents and walkers by providing shade, improved aesthetics, and outdoor gathering spaces. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

In addition to the three climate variables provided by the NEX-DCP30 dataset (minimum monthly temperature, maximum monthly temperature, and precipitation) a corresponding estimate of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was developed to match the spatial and temporal scales of the input dataset. PET represents the cumulative amount of water returned to the atmosphere due to evaporation from Earth\u2019s surface and plant transpiration under ideal circumstances (i.e., a vegetated surface shading the ground and unlimited water supply). PET was calculated using the Hamon PET equation (Hamon, 1961) and CBM model for daylength (Forsythe et al. 1995) for the 4 RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and organized by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) and annually for the years 2006 \u2013 2099.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Cluster analysis for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains the results of a cluster analysis of ecological integrity indices for stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset portrays the percent of workers who commute to work using various modes, and the percent who work from home within each Census Block Group (CBG) during 2008-2012. Data were compiled from the Census ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year Summary Data. The commute modes are the travel methods workers use to get from home to work. The commute modes mapped include private vehicle use (drive alone or carpooling), public transit, bicycling, and walking. Workers who work from home were also reported. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Points",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset is a point feature class showing the locations of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "description": "This dataset shows the temporal frequency and spatial extent of cyanobacteria cells in large, freshwater lakes and reservoirs across the continental United States derived from 300x300 meter MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite imagery from 2002-2012 and functionally similar Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite imagery from 2017-2021. This dataset was produced through a partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This cyanobacteria dataset was derived using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Envisat MERIS sensor and their Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor. MERIS and OLCI are nadir-pointing imaging spectrometers which measure the solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 15 and 21 spectral bands, respectively (visible through near-infrared). MERIS and OLCI imagery was used to identify long-wavelength spectral bands (from red through near-infrared portion of the spectrum) to locate algal blooms within freshwaters and estuaries of the continental United States. EnviroAtlas allows users to spatially explore this cyanobacteria data in the online interactive map viewer. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the continental United States.

             "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, the community domestic water use was calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Durham, NC, the Division of Water Resources (DWR), part of the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources (NCDENR), has made local water supply plans centrally available online. All local governments are required to provide public water service. Community water systems with 1,000+ service connections or 3,000+ residents are required to prepare a local water supply plan. These plans include residential, also known as domestic, water usage. To account for variations due to weather, a ten-year average was calculated for Durham, Hillsborough, and the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA), which supplies southeast Orange County, including Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The ten-year average included available data between 2000 and 2010. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Risk is defined as there being greater than a 50% chance of having a drinking water violation. Observed violations of the nitrate standard in public drinking water was used to make predictions across the conterminous United States. The data on nitrate violations comes from the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) and the data used as predictor variables in the prediction models comes from EPA's StreamCat database. The original predictions were made at the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Catchment scale and summarized at the HUC12 scale and/or 300 m pixel scale. The maps show that 19% of the conterminous United States is at risk of groundwater sourced drinking violations, while 16% of the U.S. is at risk of nitrate violations from surface water sources. Regions with the highest risk of nitrate drinking violations from groundwater sources are found in the southwest, south central plains, parts of north west, mid-Atlantic. Surface water sourced nitrate violations have the greatest risk primarily in the southwest and south-central areas of the U.S. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

The values are based on 2010 water demand and 2010 population distribution, and have been summarized by subwatershed, or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12). For the purposes of this metric, domestic water use includes residential uses, such as for drinking, bathing, cleaning, landscaping, and pools. Depending on the location, domestic water can be self-supplied, such as by private wells, or publicly-supplied, such as by municipalities. Sources include surface water and groundwater. Estimates are for primary residences only (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals).

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Indices of Ecological Integrity of stream confluences for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains indices of ecological integrity in the upstream catchments and watersheds of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Depending upon the type of market or project and data availability, polygons reflect market coverage areas, project footprints, or project primary impact areas in which ecosystem service markets and projects operate. The data were collected via surveys and desk research conducted by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace from 2008 to 2016 on biodiversity (i.e., imperiled species/habitats; wetlands and streams), carbon, and water markets. Additional biodiversity data were obtained from the Regulatory In-lieu Fee and Bank Information Tracking System (RIBITS) database in 2015. Attribute data include information regarding the methodology, design, and development of biodiversity, carbon, and water markets and projects. This dataset was produced by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace for EnviroAtlas in order to support public access to and use of information related to environmental markets.

The data were collected via surveys and desk research conducted by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace during 2014 regarding markets operating to protect watershed ecosystem services. Utilizing these data, the number of water market coverage areas overlaying each HUC8 watershed were calculated to produce this dataset. Only water markets identified as operating at the watershed level (i.e., single or multiple watersheds define the market boundaries) were included in the count of water markets per HUC8 watershed. Excluded were water markets operating at the national, state, county, or federal lands level and all water projects. Attribute data include the watershed's 8-digit hydrologic unit code and name, in addition to the watershed-level water market count associated with the watershed.

Layers include data collected via surveys and desk research conducted by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace from 2008 to 2016 on biodiversity (i.e., imperiled species/habitats; wetlands and streams), carbon, and water markets and enabling conditions that facilitate, directly or indirectly, market-based approaches to protecting and investing in those ecosystem services. This dataset was produced by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace for EnviroAtlas in order to support public access to and use of information related to environmental markets. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset shows the employment rate, or the percent of the population aged 16-64 who have worked in the past 12 months. The employment rate is a measure of the percent of the working-age population who are employed. It is an indicator of the prevalence of unemployment, which is often used to assess labor market conditions by economists. It is a widely used metric to evaluate the sustainable development of communities (NRC, 2011, UNECE, 2009). This dataset is based on the American Community Survey 5-year data for 2008-2012. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The EnviroAtlas Potentially Restorable Wetlands on Agricultural Land (PRW-Ag) dataset shows potentially restorable wetlands at 30-meter resolution. Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potentially restorable wetlands, as developed for this map, are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Estimated floodplain map for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "Understanding the relationship between flood inundation and floodplains is critical for ecosystem and community health and well-being, as well as targeting floodplain and riparian restoration. Many communities in the United States, particularly those in rural areas, lack inundation maps due to the high cost of flood modeling. Only 60% of the conterminous United States has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This EnviroAtlas dataset provides an estimate of the 100-year floodplain for the conterminous United States at 30-meter resolution to fill the gaps in the FIRM. The model hit rate for the CONUS was 0.79 compared to the FIRM, indicating that the model captured 79% of the 100-year floodplain identified by FEMA. This product provides complete coverage for the CONUS by identifying floodplains in areas without FIRMs, while also identifying floodplains in tributaries sometimes excluded by FEMA. More information can be found in the journal article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.353). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Fresno, CA, urban water management plan data is available through the California Department of Water Resources (CADWR). Suppliers that provide over 3,000 acre-feet or serve more than 3,000 connections are required to evaluate future water supplies and implement plans to reduce 2010 baseline consumption by 20% by 2020. Within the EnviroAtlas Fresno study area, there are two service providers, City of Fresno and City of Clovis, with baseline 2010 water use estimates of 313 and 249 GPD respectively.

The roads are interstates, arterials, and collectors within the EnviroAtlas community boundary. Forest is defined as Trees & Forest and Orchards. Sufficient tree bufferage is defined as 25% coverage within the circular moving window with a radius of 14.5m at any given point along the roadway. There are potential negative health effects for those living in a location without a sufficient tree buffer. Those populations are estimated here using dasymetric data calculated for the EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Synthetic N fertilizer inputs in 2006 were estimated using county-level estimates of farm N fertilizer inputs. We acquired county-level data describing total farm-level inputs (kg N/yr) of synthetic N fertilizer to individual counties in 2006 from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2012/5207/). These data were converted to per area rates (kg N/ha/yr) of synthetic N fertilizer application by dividing the total N input by the land area (ha) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands within a county as determined from county-level (http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/Boundaries.html) summarization of the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD; http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_data.php). We distributed county-specific, annual per area N inputs rates (kg N/ha/yr) to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county using the raster calculator tool in ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA). Fertilizer data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types.
