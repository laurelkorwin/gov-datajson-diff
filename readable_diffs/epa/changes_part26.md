-            "description": "Exposure of the airways to cigarette smoke (CS) is the primary risk factor for developing several lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). CS consists of a complex mixture of over 6000 chemicals including the highly reactive \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Acrolein is thought to be responsible for a large proportion of the non-cancer disease risk associated with smoking. Emerging evidence suggest a key role for CS-induced abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology and function in airway epithelial cells in COPD pathogenesis. Although in vitro studies suggest acrolein-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in airway epithelial cells, it is unknown if in vivo inhalation of acrolein affects mitochondrial content or the pathways controlling this. In this study, rats were acutely exposed to acrolein by inhalation (nose-only; 0-4 ppm), 4 hours/day for 1 or 2 consecutive days (n=6/group). Subsequently, the activity and abundance of key constituents of mitochondrial metabolic pathways as well as expression of critical proteins and genes controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy were investigated in lung homogenates. A transient decreasing response in protein and transcript abundance of subunits of the electron transport chain complexes was observed following acrolein inhalation. Moreover, acrolein inhalation caused a decreased abundance of key regulators associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively a differential response on day 1 versus day 2. Abundance of components of the mitophagy machinery was in general unaltered in response to acrolein exposure in rat lung. Collectively, this study demonstrates that acrolein inhalation acutely and dose-dependently disrupts the molecular regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in rat lung. Hence, understanding the effect of acrolein on mitochondrial function will provide a scientifically supported reasoning to shortlist aldehydes regulation in tobacco smoke.

It can be accessed through the following means: Data can be obtained from corresponding author of the paper.

Three major scenarios were presented in the manuscript: 1) mechanical recycling (existing recycling infrastructure), 2) implementing chemical recycling to the existing plastics recycling, and 3) extracting chemical additives before the manufacturing stage.\nUsers would primarily modify values on the yellow tab \"US 2018 Facts - Sensitivity\". Values highlighted in yellow may be changed for sensitivity analysis purposes. Please note that the values shown for MSW generated, recycled, incinerated, landfilled, composted, imported, exported, re-exported, and other categories in this tab were based on 2018 data. Analysis for other years can be made possible with a replicate version of this spreadsheet and the necessary data to replace those of 2018.\nMost of the tabs, especially those that contain \"Stream # - Description\", do not require user interaction. They are intermediate calculations that change according to the user inputs. It is available for the user to see so that the calculation/method is transparent. The major results of these individual stream tabs are ultimately compiled into one summary tab. All streams throughout the plastics life cycle, for each respective scenario (1, 2, and 3), are shown in the \"US Mat Flow Analysis 2018\" tab. For each stream, we accounted the approximate mass of plastics found in MSW, additives that may be present, and non-plastics. Each spreadsheet contains a representative diagram that matches the stream label. This illustration is placed to aid the user with understanding the connection between each stage in the plastics' life cycle.\nFor example, the Scenario 1 spreadsheet uniquely contains Material Flow Analysis Summary, in addition to the LCI. In the \"Material Flow Analysis Summary\" tab, we represented the input, output, releases, exposures, and greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of materials inputted into a specific stage in the plastics life cycle.\nThe \"Life Cycle Inventory\" tab contributes additional calculations to estimate land, air, and water releases.\nFigures and Data - A gs analysis on eol plastic management\nThis word document contains the raw data used to create all the figures in the main manuscript.

We isolated RNA and DNA \u00b1 ORG\u0394 from paired FFPE and frozen human renal and ovarian carcinoma specimens collected as part of the National Cancer Institute Biospecimen Pre-analytical Variables program. Tumor types were microscopically confirmed from adjacent tissue sections. Following extraction, DNA was fragmented and sequence differences were compared between frozen and FFPE sample pairs. Treatment with ORG\u0394 improved concurrent SNP calls in FFPE DNA compared to non-ORG\u0394 FFPE samples and enhanced confidence in SNP calls for all FFPE DNA samples, beyond that of matched frozen samples. In general, the concordant SNPs identified in paired frozen and FFPE DNA samples agreed for both genotype and homozygosity vs. heterozygosity of calls regardless of ORG\u0394 treatment. The increased confidence in ORG\u0394 FFPE DNA variant calls relative to the matched frozen DNA suggests a novel application of this method. With further optimization, this method may improve quality of DNA-sequencing data in frozen as well as FFPE tissue samples. These findings could have important implications for studies using FFPE samples, especially if adequate matched controls are not available. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nWehmas, L., C.

DC prevalence rate was defined as the propor-tion of people within a county who had previously been diagnosed with diabetes (high fasting plasma glu-cose \uf0b3126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of \uf0b36.5%, or diabetes diagnosis) but do not currently have high fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c for the period 2004-2012. DC prevalence estimates were calculated using a two-stage approach. The first stage used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to predict high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (\u2265126 mg/dL) and/or HbA1C levels (\u22656.5% [48 mmol/mol]) based on self-reported demographic and behavioral characteristics (16). This model was then applied to Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to impute high FPG and/or HbA1C status for each BRFSS respondent (16). The second stage used the imputed BRFSS data to fit a series of small area models, which were used to predict county-level prevalence of diabetes-related outcomes, including DC (16).\nThe EQI was constructed for 2006-2010 for all US counties and is composed of five domains (air, water, built, land, and sociodemographic), each composed of variables to represent the environmental quality of that domain. Domain-specific EQIs were developed using principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce these variables within each domain while the overall EQI was constructed from a second PCA from these individual domains (L. C. Messer et al., 2014). To account for differences in environment across rural and urban counties, the overall and domain-specific EQIs were stratified by rural urban continuum codes (RUCCs) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).\nResults are reported as prevalence rate differences (PRD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the highest quintile/worst environmental quality to the lowest quintile/best environmental quality expo-sure metrics. PRDs are representative of the entire period of interest, 2004-2012. Due to availability of DC data and covariate data, not all counties were captured, however, the majority, 3134 of 3142 were utilized in the analysis.

Formation of respective metabolites 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid was validated by analytical methods and demonstrated to be conserved across orders of biological organization in both microsomal and liver slice assays. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined for the microsomal conversion of imidacloprid to 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid in rainbow trout (Km=79.2 \u00b5M; Vmax=0.75 pmole/min/mg) and rat (Km=158.7 \u00b5M; Vmax=38.4 pmole/min/mg). Kinetics for the microsomal demethylation of acetamiprid to N-desmethyl-acetamiprid were determined in the rat (Km=70.9 \u00b5M; Vmax=4.10 pmoles/min/mg). N-desmethyl-acetamiprid was found in detectable but below quantifiable levels across the range of test concentrations which precluded a calculation of kinetic rate constants in rainbow trout (RBT).

The resulting dataset is available in the supplemental file \u201cSupplemental_Application.xlsx\u201d.\nIt should be noted that the dataset used in this demonstration is biased toward environmentally relevant chemicals, many of which appear in a large number of chemical lists on the Dashboard (see the DATA_SOURCES column in \u201cSupplemental_Application.xlsx\u201d for both ESI+ and ESI-).  \n\nTraining and test datasets were constructed using the PaDEL descriptors and the ESI+ and ESI- endpoint values discussed previously. These training and test sets are provided in the supplemental file \u201cSupplemental_train_test.xlsx\u201d.\n\nA list of descriptors is provided in the supplemental file \u201cSupplemental_Descriptors.xlsx\u201d.\n\nA similar plot (Figure S1) of variable importance for the ESI+ upsampled model, and a similar plot (Figure S2) of variable importance for the ESI- upsampled model can be found in \u201cSupplemental_Figures.docx\u201d. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLowe, C., K.

Throughout the duration of this study, steady state was not reached, suggesting that concentrations continue to increase during this time. Simulations showed that nano copper oxide and ionic copper accumulated to the highest concentrations in the surface sediments, followed by the deeper sediments. The simulations were sensitive to the heteroaggregation attachment efficiency, which is a function of lake water chemistry and thus site specific. Simulations with lower attachment efficiencies resulted in lower concentrations of nano copper oxide in surface water and sediments, while higher attachment efficiencies showed higher concentrations of nano copper oxide. These results suggest the importance of water chemistry on the potential ecological impact of nano copper oxide. Additionally, a modeling scenario was performed where the use of nano copper oxide on boats ceased after 50 years. Simulated results showed a phase where concentrations of nano copper oxide and ionic copper dropped, followed by a slower reduction in simulated concentrations. In the water column, ionic copper reaches a higher concentration, yet recovery concentrations decrease faster, while nano copper oxide concentrations are lower in the accumulation phase and end up higher in the recovery phase. These results have implications on the potential long-term effects of the use of nano copper oxide. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nRoss, B., and C. Knightes.

Research to determine how effective these different UVC sources are against microorganisms and viruses is often conducted using different methods and laboratory conditions, which can make it difficult to compare results between studies and understand how effective UVC devices will be in real-world settings. In this research, we compare how some of these different experimental factors affect the efficacy of UVC light for disinfecting surfaces. We propose that microscopic differences between even smooth materials can potentially shield microorganisms and viruses from UVC light, making the surface an important factor in determining how effective the light can be, and that the UVC dose reported to achieve a 90% reduction cannot always be linearly extrapolated to predict the 99.9% reduction dose.

The differences are attributed to the alteration of effective actinic flux affected by single-scattering albedo (SSA). ADEs through the dynamics pathway act as an equally or even more important route compared with the photolysis pathway in affecting secondary aerosol concentration in both summer and winter. ADEs through dynamics traps formed sulfate within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) which increases sulfate concentration in winter. Meanwhile, the impact of ADEs through dynamics is mainly reflected in the increase of gaseous-precursor concentrations within the PBL which enhances secondary aerosol formation in summer. For nitrate, reduced upward transport of precursors restrains the formation at high altitude and eventually lowers the nitrate concentration within the PBL in winter, while such weakened vertical transport of precursors increases nitrate concentration within the PBL in summer, since nitrate is mainly formed near the surface ground. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nWang, J., J.

Mice were treated with 6.25-25 ppm Pb acetate (PbOAc) or 7.5-30 ppm Pb in reference soil SRM 2710a having 0.552% Pb among other heavy metals such as Cd.  Feces and ceca were collected following 9 days of treatment and the microbiome analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.  Treatment effects on the microbiome were observed in both feces and ceca of mice.  Changes in the cecal microbiomes of mice fed  Pb were similar except for a few exceptions regardless of source.   Akkermansia, a common gut bacterium, was highest ranked species in control microbiomes whereas Lactobacillus ranked highest in treated mice. Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios in the ceca of PbOAc and SRM 2710a treated mice increased suggestive of changes in gut microbiome metabolism that promotes obesity. Bacilli/Clostridia  increased in the ceca of PbOAc treated mice and may be indicative of increased risk of host sepsis.  Family Deferribacteraceae also were modulated by PbOAc or SRM 2710a, respectively, possibly impacting iron metabolism.  Understanding the relationship between microbiome composition and Pb concentration, especially in soil, may ultimately provide new insights into the utility of various remediation methodologies that modulate the effects and assist in the selection of an optimal treatment for a specific contaminated site. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGeorge, S., R.

A modified MEOGRT was used to evaluate multigenerational effects of 2-ethylhexyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (2-EHHB) under flow-through conditions starting with adults (parent generation, F0) through a 3-week reproductive phase of the second generation (F2). Fish were exposed to one of five 2-EHHB test concentrations or a dechlorinated tap water control. Fecundity was affected at the lowest exposure (5.32\u202f\u00b5g/L) and greater sensitivity occurred in the F1 and F2 generations. Percent fertility was also diminished progressing from >101 \u00b5g/L in the F0 generation to 101 and 48.8 \u00b5g/L in the F1 and F2 generations, respectively. Growth indices were decreased for F0 adult females and F1 subadults and adults at 48.8 \u00b5g/L 2-EHHB. Histopathologic examination of gonads, liver, kidney, and thyroid yielded possible delayed reproductive tract development in F1 subadult males, masculinization of the renal phenotype in F1 adult females (renal tubular eosinophilia), and reduced hepatic energy storage (liver glycogen vacuoles) in F1 males at 11.3 \u00b5g/L and F1 and F2 generation females at 48.8 \u00b5g/L. Endocrine-related findings included a decrease in anal fin papillae in F2 adult males at 101 \u00b5g/L. Results of this study demonstrate effects on growth, development, and reproduction that may be mediated by endocrine (weak estrogenic) and non-endocrine mechanisms. Duration of the MEOGRT should not be routinely extended beyond the OCSPP 890 guideline study design.

The manuscript presents the data on the evaluation of performance of the traditional culture (TC) and the rapid viability-polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) methods for compatibility with detection of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk), a surrogate for the anthrax causing Bacillus anthracis, in maritime environmental surface and grab samples. Employing the commonly used surface sampling tools such as Sponge-Sticks and vacuum filter cassettes, samples containing background materials were collected from the response boat-small, response boat-medium, navigation computer screens on these boats, pier concrete, and wood surfaces at the USCG base in Portsmouth, VA. Also collected were grab samples (e.g., grass, gravel, boat wash-water). These samples were spiked in the laboratory with the spores of Bacillus thuringiensis which is commonly used as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. The spiked samples were then processed to recover spores and analyzed by the two analytical methods. The performance of these methods was compared and is described in this manuscript. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNelson, S., K. Hofacre, M. Calfee, S. Serre, E.

The manuscript presents the data on the evaluation of performance of the traditional culture (TC) and the rapid viability-polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) methods for compatibility with detection of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk), a surrogate for the anthrax causing Bacillus anthracis, in maritime environmental surface and grab samples. Employing the commonly used surface sampling tools such as Sponge-Sticks and vacuum filter cassettes, samples containing background materials were collected from the response boat-small, response boat-medium, navigation computer screens on these boats, pier concrete, and wood surfaces at the USCG base in Portsmouth, VA. Also collected were grab samples (e.g., grass, gravel, boat wash-water). These samples were spiked in the laboratory with the spores of Bacillus thuringiensis which is commonly used as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. The spiked samples were then processed to recover spores and analyzed by the two analytical methods. The performance of these methods was compared and is described in this manuscript. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNelson, S., K. Hofacre, M. Calfee, S. Serre, E.

Concentrations lower than the detection limits were censored and substituted with the detection limits. NH4 concentrations were generally quite low and near or below detection limits, so we do not examine the NH4 trend. TON concentrations were not directly measured during the survey and hence were calculated as the difference between TN and inorganic N (NO3 plus NH4). Negative TON values were found at 40 sites and were treated as values below the detection limit. We also included DOC concentrations and stream DOC/TON ratios from the surveys in the analysis to further understand changes in stream organic matter over time. ",
