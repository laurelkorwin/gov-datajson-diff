-            "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset portrays the total number of historic places located within each Census Block Group (CBG). The historic places data were compiled from the National Register of Historic Places, which provides official federal lists of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects significant to American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Intersections are defined as any point where 3 or more roads meet and density is calculated using kernel density, where closer intersections are weighted higher than further intersections. Intersection density is highly correlated with walking for transportation. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Because these data are based on SSURGO map units' percent hydric there are four thresholds used to classify if a particular map unit would be hydric. These thresholds are 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, where a map unit area that had a value of 42% for the SSURGO hydric measurement (based on the raster dataset named \"sum_comppct_r2_hydric\") would be considered non-hydric under the 60% threshold but hydric under both the 20% and 40% thresholds. For this dataset, the threshold of 80% is used. This dataset was produced by Tetra Tech, Inc. to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

These metrics were created from grouping national level single species habitat models created by the USGS Gap Analysis Program into smaller ecologically based, phylogeny based, or stakeholder suggested composites. The dataset includes reptile species richness metrics for all reptile species, lizards, snakes, turtles, poisonous reptiles, Natureserve-listed G1,G2, and G3 reptile species, and reptile species listed by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), PARC (Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation) and SWPARC (Southwest Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation). This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and USGS to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

According to EPA report 600/R-97/130, roads can affect stream water in many ways and roads in close proximity to streams have the most potential for adverse effects on stream water quality. Since roads have an impervious surface, and ditches are built to channel water from roads into streams, the rate of water runoff is higher where there are more roads. Not only does this lead to increased scour of the river channel and stream banks, but it can also be a preferential pathway for runoff associated with road salting or routine maintenance which, along with other spills on the roadway, can lead to overall reductions in water quality.

It also includes the soil loss and sediment yield prevented by natural vegetation, calculated as the difference between soil loss or sediment yield with existing land cover and under the vegetation removal scenario. This dataset is based on a collection of six rasters showing runoff, sediment delivery ratio, and sediment yield to streams and waterbodies under two land cover scenarios. The two scenarios are the existing vegetation scenario based on the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and a scenario in which natural land cover was replaced with barren land. Average annual soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion was calculated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) equation for both scenarios. A Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) was then applied to both scenarios. The SDR was multiplied by the average annual soil loss to estimate net sediment yield to downstream waterways under both scenarios. These datasets can be used together to quantify the soil retention services of natural vegetation. The datasets used as inputs include the 2011 NLCD, 1971-2000 Rainfall-runoff erosivity factor from PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model), the U.S. Geological Survey's 30-meter digital elevation model (DEM), Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO2) data, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s crop management zones (CMZs).

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to San Diego, CA, Urban Water Management Plans (available via data.ca.gov and individual providers) and an average of available Residential Gallons Per Capita per Day (R-GPCD) data (available through the California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB)) were used. Within the EnviroAtlas community boundary, provider estimates range from 61 to 362 GPD.

-            "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, community level domestic water demand is calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by Census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to San Diego, CA, Urban Water Management Plans (available via data.ca.gov and individual providers) and an average of available Residential Gallons Per Capita per Day (R-GPCD) data (available through the California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB)) were used. Within the EnviroAtlas community boundary, provider estimates range from 61 to 362 GPD. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to classify a land cover product with seven land cover classes: Tree Canopy, Grass/Shrub, Bare Earth, Water, Buildings, Roads, Other Paved Surfaces.\n\nThis EPA-modified dataset was derived from the SAL seven-class land cover product. Land cover data were resampled to a 1-meter spatial resolution by EPA for MULC data product integration. Updates to the data were completed by EPA in 2020 to correct for errors or data voids in the original dataset and modified, as necessary, to meet MULC mapping product standards. The seven land cover classes mapped by SAL were condensed by EPA into five baseline land cover class categories as follows: Water, Impervious, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous. Additional corrections to the five condensed land cover classes were implemented using the five land cover classes prior to any additional land cover class category additions and final modifications.\n\nThe mapped area is confined to the boundaries of US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for San Diego County, with an added 1-km buffer area around the San Diego dataset extent (with exception of areas on the southern U.S - Mexico border). A total of seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands.\n\nThe mapped area encompasses a total approximate area of 3,974 square kilometers and is confined to the boundaries of US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for San Diego County, with an added 1-km buffer area (with exception of the data extent along the southern U.S - Mexico borderline). A total of seven land cover classes were mapped in the finalized product: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands.\n\nIntegrated wetland features were derived using ancillary National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) polygon data (version 2), downloaded from the Unites States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Wetland Mapper web mapping service (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/mapper.html). Metadata for the NWI wetlands data layer can be found at http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Metadata.html. \n\nAn accuracy assessment of the classified product, using 1259 combined random and stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference sample points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 52.0 percent and a fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 83.4 percent.\n\nThis dataset was collaboratively developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, the United States Forest Service Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessment program, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.
