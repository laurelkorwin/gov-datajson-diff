-            "description": "Tracers of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from thirteen aromatic hydrocarbons were quantified in laboratory smog chamber experiments. Class-specific SOA tracers emerged, including 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxo-pentatonic acid (DHOPA) from monoaromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phthalic acid from naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene, and methyl-nitrocatechol isomers from o,m,p-cresol oxidation. Organic carbon mass fractions (fSOC) for these and other tracers were determined and extend the SOA tracer method widely used to apportion biogenic SOC. The extended SOA tracer model was applied to evaluate the sources of SOC in Atlanta, GA during summer 2015 and winter 2016 after modifying the chamber-derived fSOC\u00ac values to reflect SOA yields and local VOC levels (fSOC\u2019). Monoaromatic, diaromatic, and cresol SOC contributed an average of 24%, 8%, and 0.12% of organic carbon (OC) mass during summer and 17%, 5%, and 0.27% during winter, respectively. Cresol SOC peaked during winter and was highly correlated with levoglucosan (r=0.93, p<0.001), consistent with it originating from biomass burning. Together, aromatic, biogenic, and biomass burning derived SOC accounted for an average of 77% and 28% of OC in summer and winter, respectively. The new understanding of SOA composition from aromatic VOCs advances the tracer-based method by including important precursors of SOC and enables a better understanding of the sources of atmospheric aerosol. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nAl-Naiema, I.M., J.

Format: Data is CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality) air quality modeling data contained in 12km grids (covering the eastern US) and 36 km grids (covering the entire US) for the years 2004, 2005, and 2006. Each CMAQ grid contains a concentration value for an air pollutant (fine particulate matter - PM2.5), and this concentration value can be used to determine the impact of air pollution concentrations on hospital emergency department admissions for asthma, and hospital inpatient admissions for asthma, myocardial infraction (MI), and heart failure (HF) in Baltimore Maryland. CMAQ data is in both *.IOAPI (Input/Output Applications Programming Interface) format and *.csv (comma-separated value) format. Health data was used in this analysis, but the health data cannot be released because it contains personally identifiable information (PII) on living individuals, and is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) of 1996 (as amended), and is exempt from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The health dataset contains information about human research subjects, and access to it was limited by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) decision of 19 February 2014 (Protocol #13-76), and updated on 8 December 2016. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBraggio, J., E.

Sample input data and three sets of model outputs covering the conterminous United States are included with this data set. The three sets of outputs represent three different applications of the CMAQ as described in Rasool et al. (2016). The BDSNP module helps to improve the timing and spatial distribution of estimates of soil nitric oxide (NO) emissions through parameterization of soils, meteorology, land use, and mineral nitrogen availability from both fertilization and deposition.

Groundwater-tracing data obtained using in situ automatic sampling or detection devices may result in very high-density data sets. Data-dense tracer BTCs obtained using in situ devices and stored in dataloggers can result in visually cluttered overlapping data points. The relatively large amounts of data detected by high-frequency settings available on in situ devices and stored in dataloggers ensure that important tracer BTC features, such as data peaks, are not missed. Alternatively, such dense datasets can also be difficult to interpret. Even more difficult, is the application of such dense data sets in solute-transport models that may not be able to adequately reproduce tracer BTC shapes due to the overwhelming mass of data. One solution to the difficulties associated with analyzing, interpreting, and modeling dense data sets is the selective removal of blocks of the data from the total dataset. Although it is possible to arrange to skip blocks of tracer BTC data in a periodic sense (data decimation) so as to lessen the size and density of the dataset, skipping or deleting blocks of data also may result in missing the important features that the high-frequency detection setting efforts were intended to detect. Rather than removing, reducing, or reformulating data overlap, signal filtering and smoothing may be utilized but\nsmoothing errors (e.g., averaging errors, outliers, and potential time shifts) need to be considered. Appropriate probability distributions to tracer BTCs may be used to describe typical tracer BTC shapes, which usually include long tails. Recognizing appropriate probability distributions applicable to tracer BTCs can help in understanding some aspects of the tracer migration. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publications:\nField, M.

The data show that IVOCs make up a significant fraction of the total source of secondary organic aerosol in urban environments and that mobile sources make up only about one third to half of the total IVOC emissions. Other urban sources of IVOCs were explored. These data are visualized and presented in the figures published in a peer-reviewed manuscript (with corresponding title) in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.\n\nThe raw CMAQ output data are backed up and preserved on the ATMOS supercomputing system at the National Computing Center in Durham, North Carolina.

The data show that IVOCs make up a significant fraction of the total source of secondary organic aerosol in urban environments and that mobile sources make up only about one third to half of the total IVOC emissions. Other urban sources of IVOCs were explored. These data are visualized and presented in the figures published in a peer-reviewed manuscript (with corresponding title) in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.\n\nThe raw CMAQ output data are backed up and preserved on the ATMOS supercomputing system at the National Computing Center in Durham, North Carolina.

-            "description": "Poor air quality in Alaska\u2019s remote communities due to road dust is one of the top environmental concerns of residents in these communities. Most communities are disconnected from the road network, with community roads that are predominantly unpaved. In Alaska, high costs limit widespread paving of roads, leaving communities to rely on alternative dust control strategies. The goals for this study were to assess the magnitude and impact of the dust problem in rural Alaska and use a diversity of experience, including regulatory, research, engineering, and cultural, to develop a road-dust management approach for rural Alaska. The plan incorporates different levels of dust management: institutional controls, road watering, chemical dust suppressants, and road surface stabilization. Geographical zones where use of each different dust management level will be most appropriate are identified based on rainfall frequency. Approximately 50% of Alaska\u2019s communities can manage road dust with institutional controls and road watering. Many of the road-dust management ideas presented are transferable to other global regions that experience similar economic and community access challenges as Alaska.

Some UVFs are hydrophobic (log Kow > 4) which has led to concern that they may bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of two widely-used UVFs, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OCT) in rainbow trout exposed via the diet.  EHMC and OCT were significantly metabolized by trout and this metabolism substantially reduced bioaccumulation relative to levels observed for a set of poorly transformed chemicals having similar log Kow values.  Derived bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and biomagnification factors (BMFs) for both UVFs were well below established bioaccumulation criteria, suggesting that EHMC and OCT are unlikely to pose a bioaccumulation hazard in trout.  This research substantially increases existing knowledge concerning the fate and effects of UVFs in the environment. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSaunders, L., A.

EHMC and OCT were significantly metabolized by trout and this metabolism substantially reduced bioaccumulation relative to levels observed for a set of poorly transformed chemicals having similar log Kow values.  Derived bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and biomagnification factors (BMFs) for both UVFs were well below established bioaccumulation criteria, suggesting that EHMC and OCT are unlikely to pose a bioaccumulation hazard in trout.  This research substantially increases existing knowledge concerning the fate and effects of UVFs in the environment. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSaunders, L., A. Hoffman, J. Nichols, and F. Gobas. Dietary bioaccumulation and biotransformation of hydrophobic organic sunscreen agents in rainbow trout.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY.

The modeling system was applied to track the contribution from a wildfire (Wallow) and prescribed fire (Flint Hills) using both source sensitivity and source apportionment approaches. The model estimated fire contribution to primary and secondary pollutants are comparable using source sensitivity (brute-force zero out) and source apportionment (Integrated Source Apportionment Method) approaches. Model estimated O3 enhancement relative to CO is similar to values reported in literature indicating the modeling system captures the range of O3 inhibition possible near fires and O3 production both near the fire and downwind. O3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) are formed in the fire plume and transported downwind along with highly reactive VOC species such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde that are both emitted by the fire and rapidly produced in the fire plume by VOC oxidation reactions. PAN and aldehydes contribute to continued downwind O3 production. The transport and thermal decomposition of PAN to nitrogen oxides (NOX) enables O3 production in areas limited by NOX availability and the photolysis of aldehydes to produce free radicals (HOX) causes increased O3 production in NOX rich areas. The modeling system tends to overestimate hourly surface O3 at routine rural monitors in close proximity to the fires when the model predicts elevated fire impacts on O3 and Hazard Mapping System (HMS) data indicates possible fire impact. A sensitivity simulation in which solar radiation and photolysis rates were more aggressively attenuated by aerosol in the plume reduced model O3 but does not eliminate this bias. A comparison of model predicted daily average speciated PM2.5 at surface rural routine network sites when the model predicts fire impacts from either of these fires shows a tendency toward overestimation of PM2.5 organic aerosol in close proximity to these fires. The standard version of the CMAQ treats primarily emitted organic aerosol as non-volatile. An alternative approach for treating organic aerosol as semi-volatile resulted in lower PM2.5 organic aerosol from these fires but does not eliminate the bias. Future work should focus on modeling specific fire events that are well characterized in terms of size, emissions, and have extensive measurements taken near the fire and downwind to better constrain model representation of important physical and chemical processes (e.g. aerosol photolysis attenuation and organic aerosol treatment) related to wild and prescribed fires. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBaker, K., M.

In recent years, several studies have shown that the downwash algorithms within AERMOD often perform poorly in certain applications. Some studies have proposed modifications to the downwash algorithm in AERMOD to bring the model closer to representing the underlying physical processes associated with building downwash and closer to more accurately modeling observed pollutant concentrations.

The present study introduces a simple algorithm to enhance AERMOD\u2019s ability to appropriately match the dispersion pattern in the complex flow case of non-orthogonal winds. This algorithm, which is based on a rich set of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), applies to a variety of building dimensions, stack locations, and stack heights.

-            "description": "Understanding variation in physiological traits across taxa is a central question in evolutionary biology that has wide-ranging implications in biomedicine, disease ecology, and environmental protection. Sialic acid (Sia), and in particular, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), is chemically bound to galactose and the underlying glycan via \u03b12\u20133 or \u03b12\u20136 glycosidic linkage (i.e., Sia\u03b12\u20133Galactose or Sia\u03b12\u20136Galactose), conferring two different cell surface structures that affects cell to cell communication and interactions with foreign agents including microparasites and toxins. As an initial step towards understanding variation of Sia across the class Aves, we collected red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) and measured Sia quantity in 76 species and 340 individuals using HPLC-MS/MS and glycosidic linkage type in 24 species and 105 individuals using hemagglutination assay. Although Sia quantity did not, \u03b12\u20136 glycosidic linkage did exhibit a discernable phylogenetic pattern as evaluated by a phylogenetic signal (\u03bb) value of 0.7. Sia quantity appeared to be higher in after hatch year birds than hatch year birds (P\u202f<\u202f0.05); moreover, ~80% of the measured Sia across all individuals or species was expressed by ~20% of the individuals or species. Lastly, as expected, we detected a minimal presence of 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid in the avian RBCs tested. These data provide novel insights and a large baseline dataset for further study on the variability of Sia in the class Aves which might be useful for understanding Sia dependent processes in birds. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: These data are not EPA-owned. It can be accessed through the following means: The data can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author of the manuscript. The corresponding author is Mark Jankowski (jankowski.mark@epa.gov). Alternatively, the data can be accessed by contacting the principle investigator of the funding entity, Jeanne Fair (jmfair@lanl.gov). Format: As described in the manuscript, several hundred birds were sampled to determine the quantity of sialic acid and the glycosidic linkage type present on the blood cell surface of those sampled birds. The information was used to summarize the variation of sialic acid on avian red blood cells from an individual and a phylogenetic perspective. Therefore, the dataset includes all sample identification information including date and location of sample acquisition, bird taxonomic information, and sialic acid results. Citation information for this dataset can be found in the EDG's Metadata Reference Information section and Data.gov's References section.",

+            "description": "Understanding variation in physiological traits across taxa is a central question in evolutionary biology that has wide-ranging implications in biomedicine, disease ecology, and environmental protection. Sialic acid (Sia), and in particular, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), is chemically bound to galactose and the underlying glycan via \u03b12\u20133 or \u03b12\u20136 glycosidic linkage (i.e., Sia\u03b12\u20133Galactose or Sia\u03b12\u20136Galactose), conferring two different cell surface structures that affects cell to cell communication and interactions with foreign agents including microparasites and toxins. As an initial step towards understanding variation of Sia across the class Aves, we collected red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) and measured Sia quantity in 76 species and 340 individuals using HPLC-MS/MS and glycosidic linkage type in 24 species and 105 individuals using hemagglutination assay. Although Sia quantity did not, \u03b12\u20136 glycosidic linkage did exhibit a discernable phylogenetic pattern as evaluated by a phylogenetic signal (\u03bb) value of 0.7. Sia quantity appeared to be higher in after hatch year birds than hatch year birds (P\u202f<\u202f0.05); moreover, ~80% of the measured Sia across all individuals or species was expressed by ~20% of the individuals or species. Lastly, as expected, we detected a minimal presence of 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid in the avian RBCs tested. These data provide novel insights and a large baseline dataset for further study on the variability of Sia in the class Aves which might be useful for understanding Sia dependent processes in birds. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: These data are not EPA-owned. It can be accessed through the following means: The data can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author of the manuscript. The corresponding author is Mark Jankowski (jankowski.mark@epa.gov). Alternatively, the data can be accessed by contacting the principle investigator of the funding entity, Jeanne Fair (jmfair@lanl.gov). Format: As described in the manuscript, several hundred birds were sampled to determine the quantity of sialic acid and the glycosidic linkage type present on the blood cell surface of those sampled birds. The information was used to summarize the variation of sialic acid on avian red blood cells from an individual and a phylogenetic perspective. Therefore, the dataset includes all sample identification information including date and location of sample acquisition, bird taxonomic information, and sialic acid results. Citation information for this dataset can be found in the EDG's Metadata Reference Information section and Data.gov's References section.",

Emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods, referred to as Scope 3 emissions in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard, represent a significant emissions source for many organizations. To assist in quantifying these emissions, we have developed a comprehensive set of supply chain emission factors covering all categories of goods and services in the US economy. These factors are intended for quantifying emissions from purchased goods and services using the spend-based method defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. The factors were prepared using USEEIO models, which are a life cycle models of goods and services in the US economy.\n\nThe supply chain emission factors are presented in units of kilogram emissions per US dollar of purchases for a category of goods and services with a defined life cycle scope. Sets of factors covering all sectors of the economy are provided for years from 2010 to 2016 with two levels of sector aggregation. The factors are provided for both industries and commodities, where commodities are equivalent to a category of good or service, and industries are producers of one or more commodities. A set of five data quality scores covering data reliability, temporal, geographical and technological correlation and completeness of data collection is provided along with each factor.\n\nThe factors presented are as follows:\n1. Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins: emissions associated with cradle to factory gate\n2. Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors: emissions associated with factory gate to shelf, which includes emissions from transportation, wholesale and retail as well as adjustments for price markups\n3. Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins: emissions associated with cradle to shelf (equal to the sum of the above two factors)\n\nEnd users of products will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins most appropriate for their use. Organizations purchasing intermediate products at the factory gate will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins to be most appropriate.\n\nSee the Executive Summary of the associated report for an example calculation using the factors.\n\nAll factors are associated with limitations and variations in underlying data quality. We encourage the reader to carefully read the report to understand the differences across these sets, underlying assumptions in their calculation, their limitations to decide if they are appropriate for their intended use.

It further introduces a separate recovery experiment, using SRM 2585, designed to shed light on factors that affect analyte loss during extraction, cleanup, instrumental analysis, and data processing. Many compounds have been measured and reported in SRM 2585 to date; cross-referencing these compounds against those detected via NTA provides a unique means with which to critically evaluate NTA performance in a real-world context. The recovery experiment described herein further informs factors (e.g., matrix, extraction procedures) that influence compound identification using NTA. Finally, by analyzing the same mixture of compounds at different concentrations and in the presence and absence of dust matrix, the performance of NTA is evaluated here from a quantitative perspective, rather than a typical qualitative perspective. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNewton, S., J.

Using a repeat sales model , we examined the effect of GI on the value of nearby single-family homes, based on housing sales and characteristic data from 2000 to 2018. We evaluated the sales price for homes using a buffer zone of 0-0.5km, and three additional models: homes within 0-0.25km, 0.25-0.5km, and greater than 0.5km from parks where GI was installed for 25,472 sale pairs. In addition to the repeat sales model, we performed a hot spot analysis on several demographic characteristics to capture systematic differences at a smaller spatial scale and over a longer time period than the repeat sales model could capture. We used US Census data on race and household income to examine changing patterns over time and space, and a spatial lag Maximum Likelihood Estimation model to determine if the location of GI correlated with either of these demographics. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHoover, F., J.

MULC data categorize the landscape into these land cover classes: impervious surface, tree, grass-herbaceous, shrub, soil-barren, water, wetland and agriculture. MULC data are used to calculate approximately 100 EnviroAtlas metrics that serve as indicators of nature\u2019s benefits (ecosystem goods and services). MULC, a dataset for which development is ongoing, is produced by multiple classification methods using aerial photo and LiDAR datasets. The mean overall fuzzy accuracy across the EnviroAtlas communities is 88% and mean Kappa coefficient is 0.84. MULC is available in EnviroAtlas via web browser, web map service (WMS) in the user\u2019s geographic information system (GIS), and as downloadable data at EPA Environmental Data Gateway. Fact Sheets and metadata for each MULC Community are available through EnviroAtlas. Some MULC applications include mapping green and grey infrastructure, connecting land cover with socioeconomic/demographic variables, street tree planting, urban heat island analysis, mosquito habitat risk mapping and bikeway planning. This article provides practical guidance for using MULC effectively and developing similar high resolution (HR) land cover data. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nPilant, D., K.
