These MULC data and maps were derived from several sources from multiple years: leaf-off LiDAR; 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1-ft pixel orthoimagery; additional leaf-on and leaf-off imagery as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints.). Ten land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forested, Shrub, Grass/Herbaceous NonWoody Vegetation, Agriculture, Orchard, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 600 completely random and 251 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 78% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 86% (see confusion matrices below). This dataset was produced by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, the United States Forest Service Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessment program, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains information about physical characteristics, such as temperature, elevation, and precipitation, in the upstream catchments of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Domestic water demand was calculated and applied using the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) PWS Service Areas layer, population served per provider, and average water use per provider. Within the EnviroAtlas study area, there are 43 service providers with 2010-2013 estimates ranging from 34 to 102 GPD.

Having little potential access to window views of trees is defined as having no trees & forest land cover within 50 meters. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home.

Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these provider-supplied estimates are also considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Portland, ME, the Portland Water District (PWD) is the main provider for the study area. Within the study area, PWD supports Portland, South Portland, Westbrook, Scarborough, and Cape Elizabeth. PWD estimates current residential water use to be ~52 GPD. The southern portion of the study area is supported by the Biddeford and Saco Water Company (BSWC). Within the study area, their service area includes Biddeford, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, and Pine Point. BSWC estimates current residential water usage to be ~50 GPD.

Crops are only those that either benefit from or require pollinators in order to produce or improve crop production. The maximum distance a tree habitat could be from the crop pixel was 2.8 km. If the crop had no tree habitat within this distance (euclidean) then it was selected as needing habitat. The total areas of crops without nearby pollinator habitat was then summed by 12 digit HUCS.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset demonstrates the effect of changes in pollution concentration on local populations in 1176 block groups in Portland, Oregon. The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The total area classified was approximately 2160 square kilometers. The land cover data were generated from 1-m, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Imagery Program. Imagery for Oregon was collected in 2012, and imagery for Washington was collected in 2011. In addition, ancillary datasets were derived for the classification from two LiDAR datasets collected in 2007 and one LiDAR dataset collected in 2010. Eight land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees and forest, grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation, agriculture, and wetlands (both woody and emergent). An accuracy assessment using 600 completely random and 54 stratified random land cover reference points yielded an overall accuracy of 78.6%. Using a liberal interpretation with similar classes (e.g. soil / grass, soil / agriculture) the overall fuzzy accuracy is 91.4%.

Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Potentially restorable wetlands for this map are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate water and historically had poor drainage and hydric soils. By restoring some of these wetlands, it is hoped that the benefits of wetlands would also be restored.

The input data for this layer fall into three categories: topographic variables, soils, and satellite imagery. \nTopographic - DEM's sourced from USGS 3D Elevation Program (10-m)\n-Elevation\n-Aspect\n-Slope\n-Compound Topographic Index (CTI)\n-Vertical Overland Flow Distance (VOFD)\n-Horizontal Overland Flow Distance (HOFD)\n-Pythagoras Overland Flow Distance (POFD)\n-Soils - Natural Resource Conservation Service's gNATSGO and gSSURGO products\n\u00b7 Potential Wetland Soils (PWS)\n-European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (10-m) \n\nUsing these variables, the Random Forest model was run for each 2 digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) in Google Earth Engine. The model used wetlands from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) to create training data, masking out deep water areas such as the centers of lakes and rivers, and excluding estuarine and marine wetlands. For each HUC an equal number of wetland an non-wetland training points proportional to the size of the HUC were generated, with 30% of those points being reserved for accuracy assessment.

The input data for this layer fall into three categories: topographic variables, soils, and satellite imagery. \nTopographic - DEM's sourced from USGS 3D Elevation Program (10-m)\n-Elevation\n-Aspect\n-Slope\n-Compound Topographic Index (CTI)\n-Vertical Overland Flow Distance (VOFD)\n-Horizontal Overland Flow Distance (HOFD)\n-Pythagoras Overland Flow Distance (POFD)\n-Soils - Natural Resource Conservation Service's gNATSGO and gSSURGO products\n\u00b7 Potential Wetland Soils (PWS)\n-European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (10-m) \n\nUsing these variables, the Random Forest model was run for each 2 digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) in Google Earth Engine. The model used wetlands from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) to create training data, masking out deep water areas such as the centers of lakes and rivers, and excluding estuarine and marine wetlands. For each HUC an equal number of wetland and non-wetland training points proportional to the size of the HUC were generated, with 30% of those points being reserved for accuracy assessment. \n\n\nThis dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "The EnviroAtlas Potentially Restorable Wetlands on Agricultural Land (PRW-Ag) dataset shows potentially restorable wetlands at 30-meter resolution. Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potentially restorable wetlands, as developed for this map, are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.

Because these data are based on SSURGO map units' percent hydric there are four thresholds used to classify if a particular map unit would be hydric. These thresholds are 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, where a map unit area that had a value of 42% for the SSURGO hydric measurement (based on the raster dataset named \"sum_comppct_r2_hydric\") would be considered non-hydric under the 60% threshold but hydric under both the 20% and 40% thresholds. For this dataset, the threshold of 80% is used. This dataset was produced by Tetra Tech, Inc. to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "The EnviroAtlas Potential Wetland Areas (PWA) dataset shows potential wetland areas at 30-meter resolution. Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potential wetland areas, as developed for this map, are lands that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

This EnviroAtlas dataset describes the percentage of a 51-m riparian buffer that is vegetated. There is a potential for decreased water quality in areas where the riparian buffer is less vegetated. The displayed line represents the center of the analyzed riparian buffer. The water bodies analyzed include hydrologically connected streams, rivers, connectors, reservoirs, lakes/ponds, ice masses, washes, locks, and rapids within the EnviroAtlas community area. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for reptile species, based on the number of reptile species as measured by predicted habitat present within a pixel. These metrics were created from grouping national level single species habitat models created by the USGS Gap Analysis Program into smaller ecologically based, phylogeny based, or stakeholder suggested composites. The dataset includes reptile species richness metrics for all reptile species, lizards, snakes, turtles, poisonous reptiles, Natureserve-listed G1,G2, and G3 reptile species, and reptile species listed by IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), PARC (Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation) and SWPARC (Southwest Partners in Amphibian and Reptile Conservation). This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and USGS to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset describes several metrics related to road-stream crossings and roads near streams at the watershed scale. According to EPA report 600/R-97/130, roads can affect stream water in many ways and roads in close proximity to streams have the most potential for adverse effects on stream water quality. Since roads have an impervious surface, and ditches are built to channel water from roads into streams, the rate of water runoff is higher where there are more roads. Not only does this lead to increased scour of the river channel and stream banks, but it can also be a preferential pathway for runoff associated with road salting or routine maintenance which, along with other spills on the roadway, can lead to overall reductions in water quality.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas national dataset shows the average annual soil loss and sediment yield to waterbodies by 12-digit HUC subwatershed for the conterminous United States for 2011 with existing land use / land cover and under a scenario in which natural vegetation is removed. It also includes the soil loss and sediment yield prevented by natural vegetation, calculated as the difference between soil loss or sediment yield with existing land cover and under the vegetation removal scenario. This dataset is based on a collection of six rasters showing runoff, sediment delivery ratio, and sediment yield to streams and waterbodies under two land cover scenarios. The two scenarios are the existing vegetation scenario based on the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and a scenario in which natural land cover was replaced with barren land. Average annual soil loss due to sheet and rill erosion was calculated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) equation for both scenarios. A Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) was then applied to both scenarios. The SDR was multiplied by the average annual soil loss to estimate net sediment yield to downstream waterways under both scenarios. These datasets can be used together to quantify the soil retention services of natural vegetation. The datasets used as inputs include the 2011 NLCD, 1971-2000 Rainfall-runoff erosivity factor from PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model), the U.S. Geological Survey's 30-meter digital elevation model (DEM), Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO2) data, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s crop management zones (CMZs).

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for San Diego, California. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the US Forest Service to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to San Diego, CA, Urban Water Management Plans (available via data.ca.gov and individual providers) and an average of available Residential Gallons Per Capita per Day (R-GPCD) data (available through the California State Water Resources Control Board (CSWRCB)) were used. Within the EnviroAtlas community boundary, provider estimates range from 61 to 362 GPD.

             "description": "The San Diego, CA Meter Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset was generated from sub-meter image pixel resolution data created by the University of Vermont (UVM) Spatial Analysis Laboratory (SAL) through the combined use of 2014 USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) four band (red, green, blue and near infrared) aerial ortho-imagery, 2014 LiDAR data covering coastal extents, 2015 LiDAR data covering inland areas, and GIS ancillary data provided by the city of San Diego or created by the UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory under the direction of Jarlath O'Neil-Dunne. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to classify a land cover product with seven land cover classes: Tree Canopy, Grass/Shrub, Bare Earth, Water, Buildings, Roads, Other Paved Surfaces.\n\nThis EPA-modified dataset was derived from the SAL seven-class land cover product. Land cover data were resampled to a 1-meter spatial resolution by EPA for MULC data product integration. Updates to the data were completed by EPA in 2020 to correct for errors or data voids in the original dataset and modified, as necessary, to meet MULC mapping product standards. The seven land cover classes mapped by SAL were condensed by EPA into five baseline land cover class categories as follows: Water, Impervious, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous. Additional corrections to the five condensed land cover classes were implemented using the five land cover classes prior to any additional land cover class category additions and final modifications.\n\nThe mapped area is confined to the boundaries of US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for San Diego County, with an added 1-km buffer area around the San Diego dataset extent (with exception of areas on the southern U.S - Mexico border). A total of seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands.\n\nThe mapped area encompasses a total approximate area of 3,974 square kilometers and is confined to the boundaries of US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for San Diego County, with an added 1-km buffer area (with exception of the data extent along the southern U.S - Mexico borderline). A total of seven land cover classes were mapped in the finalized product: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands.\n\nIntegrated wetland features were derived using ancillary National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) polygon data (version 2), downloaded from the Unites States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Wetland Mapper web mapping service (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/mapper.html). Metadata for the NWI wetlands data layer can be found at http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Metadata.html. \n\nAn accuracy assessment of the classified product, using 1259 combined random and stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference sample points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 52.0 percent and a fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 83.4 percent.\n\nThis dataset was collaboratively developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, the United States Forest Service Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessment program, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

A potential view of water is defined as having a body of water that is greater than 300m2 within 50m of a residential location. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home. The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015) map. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, the community level domestic water use is calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). Two reports were used with city- or water supply authority- level domestic water demand data, in addition to county level data. The 2013 Jefferson County Data Book provides detailed publicly, privately, and self supplied water use and population served for 2013 and covers the Jefferson County, MO portion of the EnviroAtlas study area. The 2019 Census of Missouri Public Water Systems provides detailed publicly supplied water use and population served for 2019 and covers all of Missouri. The 2010 USGS Estimated Use of Water in the United States in 2010 report covers the missing areas, including counties in Illinois within the study area. Data from these reports were weighted across publicly, privately, and self-supplied sources by population served, resulting in a single water use estimate between 25 and 427 GPD for each of the subregions in the study area.

These MULC data and maps were derived from several sources from multiple years: LiDAR (2008-2012); 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP, 2012, 2014-2016); leaf-off 6-inch pixel four-band imagery (2015) as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints.). Eight land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forested, Grass/Herbaceous Non Woody Vegetation, Agriculture, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 745 completely random and 226 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 81% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 90% (see confusion matrices below).

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset is a point feature class showing the locations of stream confluences, with attributes showing indices of ecological integrity in the upstream catchments and watersheds of stream confluences and the results of a cluster analysis of these indices. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "The Tacoma, WA Meter Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset was generated from 1-meter image pixel resolution data sourced from 2011 USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) four band (red, green, blue and near infrared) aerial ortho-imagery. LiDAR point density data (9/m^2 point spacing), available for years 2010 and 2011, was used to map most areas of Pierce County, and supplemental LiDAR data, available for earlier years, was used to map area segments where 2010-2011 LiDAR data was not available.  A 7-band stack consisting of 1-meter, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) aerial photography, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and lidar-derived intensity and height above ground was created and primarily used to classify land cover using Genie Pro automated feature extraction software. Several ancillary datasets, such as hydrographic and transportation feature data, were edited in ArcGIS and integrated into the classification workflow.\n\nThe Tacoma, WA land cover dataset includes data for the Tacoma metropolitan area of Pierce County, WA, and encompasses a total approximate area of 1,995 square kilometers. The thematic landcover data is confined to areas included within the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical area boundaries for Pierce County, WA, with an additional 1km buffer extension that include bits of Kitsap, King and Thurston Counties.\n\nThe following seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands.\n\nMapped water bodies were generated using combined high-resolution LiDAR and ancillary hydrological data.\n\nIntegrated wetland features were derived using ancillary National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) polygon data (version 2), downloaded from the Unites States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Wetland Mapper web mapping service (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/mapper.html). Metadata for the NWI wetlands data layer can be found at http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Metadata.html.\n\nAn accuracy assessment of the classified product, using 482 completely random and 46 (Soil/Barren) stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference sample points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 85.1 percent and a fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 86.9 percent.\n\nFor data workflow processing details see Overview Description section.\n\nThis dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas/DataFactSheets).",

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset demonstrates the effect of changes in pollution concentration on local populations in 1,833 block groups in Tampa Bay, Florida. The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Florida, oversight of water resources is handled by five water management districts, each comprised of a board of Governor-appointed volunteers. These Districts focus on water supply, flood protection, water quality, and natural system preservation. Tampa is in the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). Within the EnviroAtlas Tampa boundary, there are 67 service providers with 2003-2007 estimates ranging from 59 to 230 GPD.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA,) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., upland game, waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. This dataset contains information on Reptile Species Richness, the number of reptile species per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC). The EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset summarizes by county the number of farm operations with beef cows and the number of heads they manage. The data come from the Census of Agriculture, which is administered every five years by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and include the years 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The Census classifies cattle managed on operations as beef cows, dairy cows, or other cattle (which encompasses heifers, steers, bulls, and calves). Only data regarding beef cows are displayed in this layer. Operations are categorized into small, medium, or large, based on how many heads they manage. For each county and Census year, the dataset reports the number of farm operations that manage beef cows, the number of heads on their property at the end of the Census year, and a breakdown of the operations into small, medium, and large. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

The data come from the Census of Agriculture, which is administered every five years by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and include the years 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The Census classifies cattle managed on operations as beef cows, dairy cows, or other cattle (which encompasses heifers, steers, bulls, and calves). Data regarding all three categories are displayed in this layer. Operations are categorized into small, medium, or large, based on how many heads they manage. For each county and Census year, the dataset reports the number of farm operations that manage cattle, the number of heads on their property at the end of the Census year, and a breakdown of the operations into small, medium, and large. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

For each county and Census year, the dataset reports the number of farm operations that manage turkeys and the number of heads on their property at the end of the Census year. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",
