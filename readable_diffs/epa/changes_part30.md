This article was published in AWWA Water Science.\n\nThe article abstract is as follows:\nThe feasibility of using a 26-1 fractional factorial design to screen  the relative importance of six water quality and operational factors in the removal of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) by PAC was evaluated through jar testing.  The factors were: PAC type, PAC dose, TOC concentration, turbidity, alum dose, and timing of PAC versus coagulant application.  Follow-up tests were  performed to examine the interaction of PAC dose and TOC concentrations.  All  MC-LR analyses were performed by ELISA and LC/MS/MS.  The top three effect magnitudes were the same by ELISA and LC/MS/MS:  PAC dose > PAC type > PAC application time.  Correlation coefficients between removals estimated by ELISA and LC/MS/MS were > 0.9 (p << 0.05).  With both methods, the effects of PAC type and dose were found to be markedly larger than the other factors.  The follow-up tests indicated a greater impact of PAC dose at higher NOM concentrations. Factorial designs are not commonly used to plan drinking water jar test experiments.  The results generated in this study were plausible with respect to the existing body of adsorption knowledge, thus helping to demonstrate the feasibility of the factorial approach. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nAlexander, M., T.

Unfortunately, the composition of many service lines (SLs) is uncertain. The town of Bennington, Vermont, for example, has unreliable SL records, making it challenging to build an inventory and conduct an LSL replacement program. In 2017, Bennington commenced a project to identify SL materials and replace all LSLs. 159 control homes, consisting of 99 LSL and 60 non-LSL sites, were chosen for record reviews, visual SL observations, fully flushed (FF) and sequential profile water sampling, and test excavations to evaluate method accuracies. Of the 159 control homes, records for 90 % of the 99 known LSL homes were accurate. Whereas 3 % of the 60 non-lead SL homes\u2019 records accurately identified SL material. Fully flushed and sequential profile samples (SPSs) were 73 % and 95 % accurate for identifying LSLs and 95 % and 83 % accurate for identifying non-LSLs, respectively. Results were 100 % accurate when visual observations, FF samples, and test excavation were used in a stepwise approach. A stepwise approach consisting of visual SL observations, FF samples, and SPSs achieved a 98 % accuracy at identifying LSLs and a 67 % cost reduction compared to performing test excavations at each home. Findings from this control group study are critical for state, tribal, and local officials to inform their decisions about the selected approach to identify unknown SLs.

This dataset is not publicly accessible because: EPA was not the lead in this work. The data is owned and maintained by the lead author Patrick Smart and their organization MSK Engineers. It can be accessed through the following means: Data will be made available on request. Contact the corresponding author from MSK Engineers, PE, MSK Engineers 150 Depot Street, Bennington, VT, United States, Patrick Smart (psmart@mskeng.com). Format: Data consists of the records review from 159 control homes, consisting of 99 lead service lines  and 60 non-LSL sites.  Data summary from visual service line observations, fully flushed and sequential profile water sampling, and test excavations to evaluate method accuracies were compiled. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSmart, P., L.

Surface waters in the United States have displayed elevated concentrations of PFAS, but so far discrete water sampling has been the commonly applied sampling approach. Here we field-tested a novel integrative passive sampler, a microporous polyethylene (PE) tube, and derived sampling rates (Rs) for 9 PFAS in surface waters. Three sampling campaigns were conducted, deploying PE tube passive samplers in the effluent of two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent sites plants (WWTPs) and across Narragansett Bay (RI, US) for one month each in 2017/2018. Passive samplers exhibited linear uptake of PFAS in the WWTP effluents over 16-29 days, with in-situ Rs for nine PFASs ranging from 10 mL day-1 (PFPeA) to 29 mL day-1 (PFOS). Similar sampling rates of 19 \u00b1 4.8 mL day-1 were observed in estuarine field deployments. Applying these Rs values in a different WWTP effluent predicted dissolved PFAS concentrations mostly within 50% of their observations in daily composite water samples, except for PFBA (where predictions from passive samplers were 3x greater than measured values), PFNA (1.9), PFDA (1.7) and PFPeS (0.1). These results highlight the potential use of passive samplers as measurement and assessment tools of PFAS in dynamic aquatic environments. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGardiner, C., A.

-            "description": "Individuals with psychosocial stress often experience an exaggerated response to air pollutants. Ozone (O3) exposure has been associated with the activation of the neuroendocrine stress-response system. We hypothesized that preexistent mild chronic stress plus social isolation (CS), or social isolation (SI) alone, would exacerbate the acute effects of O3 exposure on the circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones, and the expression of the genes regulating glucocorticoid stress signaling via an altered stress adaptation in a brain-region-specific manner. Male Wistar\u2013Kyoto rats (5 weeks old) were socially isolated, plus were subjected to either CS (noise, confinement, fear, uncomfortable living, hectic activity, and single housing), SI (single housing only, restricted handling and no enrichment) or no stress (NS; double housing, frequent handling and enrichment provided) for 8 weeks. The rats were then exposed to either air or O3 (0.8 ppm for 4 h), and the samples were collected immediately after. The indicators of sympathetic and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis (HPA) activation (i.e., epinephrine, corticosterone, and lymphopenia) increased with O3 exposure, but there were no effects from CS or SI, except for the depletion of serum BDNF. CS and SI revealed small changes in brain-region-specific glucocorticoid-signaling-associated markers of gene expression in the air-exposed rats (hypothalamic Nr3c1, Nr3c2 Hsp90aa1, Hspa4 and Cnr1 inhibition in SI; hippocampal HSP90aa1 increase in SI; and inhibition of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) Cnr1 in CS). Gene expression across all brain regions was altered by O3, reflective of glucocorticoid signaling effects, such as Fkbp5 in NS, CS and SI. The SI effects on Fkbp5 were greatest for SI in BNST. O3 increased Cnr2 expression in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulbs of the NS and SI groups. O3, in all stress conditions, generally inhibited the expression of Nr3c1 in all brain regions, Nr3c2 in the hippocampus and hypothalamus and Bdnf in the hippocampus. SI, in general, showed slightly greater O3-induced changes when compared to NS and CS. Serum metabolomics revealed increased sphingomyelins in the air-exposed SI and O3-exposed NS, with underlying SI dampening some of the O3-induced changes. These results suggest a potential link between preexistent SI and acute O3-induced increases in the circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones and brain-region-specific gene expression changes in glucocorticoid signaling, which may partly underlie the stress dynamic in those with long-term SI. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nValdez, M., D.

Coupons were grimed by maneuvering the test vehicles down a series of wet dirt roads. Coupons were attached and extracted at various points to evaluate C&D performance with and without grime. C&D efficacy using a water-supplied pressure washing system and a dilute sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution was determined by comparing the difference in recovered viable virus between positive control coupons and test coupons. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBoe, T., W.

Coupons were grimed by maneuvering the test vehicles down a series of wet dirt roads. Coupons were attached and extracted at various points to evaluate C&D performance with and without grime. C&D efficacy using a water-supplied pressure washing system and a dilute sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution was determined by comparing the difference in recovered viable virus between positive control coupons and test coupons. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBoe, T., W.

-            "description": "The US EPA developed a set of modeled meteorology, emissions, air quality and pollutant deposition spanning the years 2002 through 2019.  Modeled datasets cover the Conterminous US (CONUS) at a 12km horizontal grid spacing (12US1) and the Northern Hemisphere at a 108km (108NHEMI) using WRFv4.1.1 for meteorology and CMAQv5.3.2 for air quality modeling. New hemispheric and North American emissions inventories were developed using, to the extent possible, consistent input data and methods across all years, including emissions from mobile, fire, and oil and gas sources. Collectively these model outputs represent 100s of TB of data.  We have selected a subset of the model input and output datasets that we hope will be most useful to the air quality research community.  These datasets include:\n- Emissions inventory files for the CONUS for 2002-2019 suitable for input into the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) emission processor\n- Emissions trends data with annual total emissions, summed by pollutant and emissions source category\n- CMAQ-ready emissions, initial conditions and boundary condition input files for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019\n- CMAQ-ready meteorology files for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019. \n- Matched meteorology model output with surface observations for 2002-2019\n- Daily average CMAQ output for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019 for 14 pollutants\n- Daily average 3D CMAQ output for 44 layers for the 108NHEMI domain for 2002\u20132019\n- Annual total wet and dry deposition for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019\n- Hourly surface and 3D modeled meteorology, deposition and air concentrations for the 12US1 and 108NHEMI domains for 2002-2019. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFoley, K., G.

+            "description": "The US EPA developed a set of modeled meteorology, emissions, air quality and pollutant deposition spanning the years 2002 through 2019.  Modeled datasets cover the Conterminous US (CONUS) at a 12km horizontal grid spacing (12US1) and the Northern Hemisphere at a 108km (108NHEMI) using WRFv4.1.1 for meteorology and CMAQv5.3.2 for air quality modeling. New hemispheric and North American emissions inventories were developed using, to the extent possible, consistent input data and methods across all years, including emissions from mobile, fire, and oil and gas sources. Collectively these model outputs represent 100s of TB of data.  We have selected a subset of the model input and output datasets that we hope will be most useful to the air quality research community.  These datasets include:\n- Emissions inventory files for the CONUS for 2002-2019 suitable for input into the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) emission processor\n- Emissions trends data with annual total emissions, summed by pollutant and emissions source category\n- CMAQ-ready emissions, initial conditions and boundary condition input files for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019\n- CMAQ-ready meteorology files for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019. \n- Matched meteorology model output with surface observations for 2002-2019\n- Daily average CMAQ output for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019 for 14 pollutants\n- Daily average 3D CMAQ output for 44 layers for the 108NHEMI domain for 2002\u20132019\n- Annual total wet and dry deposition for the 12US1 domain for 2002-2019\n- Hourly surface and 3D modeled meteorology, deposition and air concentrations for the 12US1 and 108NHEMI domains for 2002-2019. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFoley, K., G.

As adequate supplies of TH are essential for brain development, exposures to perchlorate during pregnancy have raised concern for the developing brain. This paper describes the effects of exposure of pregnant rat dams to a classic chemical NIS inhibitor, perchlorate, on serum, thyroid gland and brain in the dam and pup. declines were observed in the newborn pup. TH were also reduced in the newborn pup brain, but both serum and brain hormones quickly recovered by PN2 despite continued maternal exposure.  Gene expression changes in the gland revealed dramatic increases in expression of Nis, serum perchlorate concentrations fell, and large increases in serum TSH were evident. Combined, these events contributed to rapid recovery of serum markers in the early postnatal period. Despite full recovery of serum and brain hormones, significant reductions in a number of molecular markers of TH-action remained in the cortex and hippocampus of the PN14 pup brain. The findings provide for the first-time quantitative information collected in the same study for thyroid hormones in the thyroid gland, serum, and brain. They provide essential quantitative data to reduce uncertainties in development of Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK), Biologically Based Dose Response (BBDR), and Quantitative Adverse Outcome (qAOP) models of thyroid disruption and neurodevelopment. They demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the neonatal thyroid gland to NIS inhibition and support the use of Comparative Thyroid Assay (CTA) for identifying thyroid system disrupting chemicals. They indicate that the postnatal rat may be much less sensitive to the neurological effects of TH insufficiency relative to humans based on species differences in the timing of brain development. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGilbert, M., I.

-            "description": "Production of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has shifted from long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids to short-chain compounds and those with ether bonds in the carbon chain. Next-generation perfluoroalkylether PFAS include HFPO-DA (\u201cGenX chemicals\u201d), Nafion Byproducts, and the PFOx homologous series that includes perfluoro-3,5,7,9-butaoxadecanoic acid (PFO4DA) and perfluoro-3,5,7,9,11-pentaoxadodecanoic acid (PFO5DoA). PFO4DA and PFO5DoA have been detected in serum and/or tissues from humans and wildlife proximal to contamination point sources. However, toxicity data are extremely limited, with no animal developmental toxicology data. To address these data gaps, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed via oral gavage to vehicle, PFO4DA, or PFO5DoA across a series of doses (0.1 to 62.5 mg/kg/day) from gestation day (GD) 18\u201322. Hepatic transcriptomics were assayed in dams and fetuses, and serum metabolomics in dams. These data were overlaid with serum PFO4DA and PFO5DoA concentrations to perform dose-response modeling. Both dams and fetuses exhibited dose-responsive disruption of hepatic gene expression in response to PFO4DA or PFO5DoA, with fetal expression disrupted at lower doses than dams. Several differentially expressed genes were upregulated by every dose of PFO5DoA in both maternal and fetal samples, including genes encoding enzymes that hydrolyze acyl-coA to free fatty acids. Maternal serum metabolomics revealed PFO4DA exposure did not induce significant changes at any tested dose, whereas PFO5DoA exposure resulted in dose-dependent differential metabolite abundance for 149 unique metabolites. Multi-omics pathway analyses of integrated maternal liver transcriptomics and serum metabolomics revealed significant convergent changes as low as 3 mg/kg/d PFO4DA and 0.3 mg/kg/d PFO5DoA exposure. Overall, transcriptomic and metabolomic effects of PFO4DA and PFO5DoA appear consistent with other carboxylic acid PFAS, with primary changes related to lipid metabolism, bile acids, cholesterol, and cellular stress. Importantly, PFO5DoA exposure more potently induced changes in maternal and fetal hepatic gene expression and maternal circulating metabolites, despite high structural similarity. Further, we report in vitro PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 receptor activation for both compounds as putative molecular mechanisms. This work demonstrates the potential developmental toxicity of alternative moiety perfluoroethers and highlights the developing liver as particularly vulnerable to transcriptomic disruption. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nJackson, T., C.

This is attributed to most of EGRs are the lower-drainage method and use a thinner substrate layer because of the structural load-bearing limits of buildings. Existing solutions depend on increasing the rainwater storage by thickening the substrate layer of EGRs, or replacing the substrate materials. We propose to enhance the water retention capacity of EGRs by adjusting vertical drainage positions and moving the lower-drainage at the bottom to upper-drainage over the substrate layer. To test the runoff control performance of EGRs with the upper-drainage method, we designed three EGR models with two different (upper- and lower-) drainage methods based on the common EGR\u2019s structure in practice and carried out total 48 experiments under different rainfall intensities with an artificial rainfall simulator. The experimental design also included adjusting structural factors of the EGR to further explore the influences of roof slope, status of vegetation growth (height and canopy cover ratio), and model size. The average runoff retention rate for the upper-drainage EGR was 61.82 %, which was much higher than the 23.94 % for the lower-drainage EGR. The concentrations of TN and TP in runoff with the upper-drainage were 2.83 and 0.18 mg/L, which were much lower than the 8.47 and 2.10 mg/L for the lower-drainage EGR. EGRs with upper-drainage overall performed better in runoff control than EGRs with lower-drainage. Vegetation height and model size did not significantly affect the rainwater control performance for different drainage methods, while the change of slope affected the rainwater interception of the EGRs with upper-drainage method.
