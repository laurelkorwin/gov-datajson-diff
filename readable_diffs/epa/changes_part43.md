             "description": "EPA has compiled a significant volume of soil, sediment, surface water and biota geodata, collected either directly, by our contractors and in many cases by our Federal, State and Tribal agency partners (grantees) to complete the remedial investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study at the Operable Unit (OU) 2 (i.e., the river, the floodplain and biota).  EPA\u2019s goal for the OU2 area is to select a remedy in 2020 that reduces, or controls risks to human health and the environment.  Specifically, this RI involves the investigation and evaluation of the heavy metals (mercury, arsenic and lead) contamination and associated drainages in the Carson River Basin which has resulted from contaminant migration from the Carson River Mercury Mines Site.\n\nThe Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessments, contained within the RI, evaluated past and current releases and their impact to human health and the environment.  The primary concern is the effect of mercury contamination from the mining operations on the residences near the former stamp mills, the fisheries, waterfowl, water plants and recreational users of the Carson River (\u201cRiver\u201d) Basin.  The OU1 area Superfund Site consists of mining wastes and releases from approximately 236 abandoned gold and silver mines from three basic source areas: the main stem of the River starting at New Empire (Morgan Mill) to Dayton, the Comstock Lode in Gold, Six and Sevenmile Canyons and several mills around Washoe Lake. Mercury from the former mill sites, has contaminated soils at and near the former mill sites, sediments in the drainages and the floodplain, the river banks, the fish and wildlife over more than a 130-mile length of the River extending downstream to the Lahontan Valley and ultimately at its terminus at the USFWS Stillwater and Fallons National Wildlife Refuges.\n\nContamination from the Site is a legacy of the Comstock mining era of the late 1860s, when mercury was imported to the area for processing of gold and silver ore. Ore mined from the Comstock Lode was transported to the individual mill sites, where it was crushed and mixed with mercury to amalgamate the precious metals before refining. The mills were located in the drainages in and around Virginia City, Silver City, Gold Hill, Dayton, Six Mile Canyon, Gold Canyon, and along main stem of the Carson River between New Empire and Dayton. An estimated 7,500 tons of mercury were discharged into the tributaries and River, primarily in the form of mercury-contaminated tailings. ",

The pipeline is anchored along its entire length for protection against frequent hurricanes and the large waves and strong currents that accompany them. The anchoring systems used were a combination of rock bolts and Manta Ray sand embedment anchors. Utulei Outfall: This was a very challenging pipeline design and installation because of the extreme slope that existed along the course of the pipeline. The outfall pipeline is 24\u201d in diameter, 350\u2019 in length, and it begins at the reef edge at a depth of 5\u2019 and plunges to a depth of 165\u2019. The pipeline has a free floating catenary section that spans the steep slope, and it is heavily anchored at the bottom in deep water.",

             "description": "The dynamic nature of the annual volume of water discharged down the Carson River over a 10-year period, which included a century flood and drought, was examined in order to gain a better understanding of mercury movement, biological availability, and exposure to waterbirds nesting at Lahontan Reservoir. Total annual water discharge directly influenced total mercury (THg) in unfiltered water above the reservoir and downstream of a mining area, whereas methyl mercury (MeHg) at the same site was negatively related to annual discharge. Annual water storage at Lahontan Reservoir in the spring and early summer, as expected, was directly related to annual Carson River discharge. In contrast to the findings from above the reservoir, annual MeHg concentrations in water sampled below the reservoir were positively correlated with the total discharge and the amount of water stored in the reservoir on 1 July; that is, the reservoir is an important location for mercury methylation, which agrees with earlier findings. However, unfiltered water MeHg concentrations were about 10-fold higher above than below the reservoir, which indicated that much MeHg that entered as well as that produced in the reservoir settled out in the reservoir.\n\n    Avian exposure to mercury at Lahontan Reservoir was evaluated in both eggs and blood of young snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax). Annual MeHg concentrations in unfiltered water below the reservoir, during the time period (days 90\u2013190) when birds were present, correlated significantly with mercury concentrations in night-heron blood, snowy egret blood, and night-heron eggs, but not snowy egret eggs. A possible reason for lack of an MeHg water correlation with snowy egret eggs is discussed and relates to potential exposure differences associated with the food habits of both species. THg concentrations in water collected below the reservoir were not related to egg or blood mercury concentrations for either species.\n\n    The initial phase of this study was a 2-year evaluation of the effects of Hg on fish-eating birds nesting at Lahontan Reservoir and Carson Lake and at reference areas in northeastern Nevada (Henny et al. 2002). In the first year (1997), reproduction of snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and black-crowned night-herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) was studied via the \u2018\u2018sample egg\u2019\u2019 technique (Blus 1984) (i.e., evaluate reproductive success of each clutch in relationship to the total Hg [THg] concentrations in the sample egg collected from that clutch). Both species laid eggs with comparatively low THg concentrations (Henny et al. 2002). Most eggs had THg concentrations below 0.80 lg/g wet weight (ww), the putative threshold concentration at which reproductive problems might be expected (Heinz 1979; Newton and Haas 1988).\n\n    The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

These workgroups were created according to the geographic location of the states in relation to one another in order to be able to better plan and coordinate activities at the regional level to achieve the U.S.-Mexico Border Program goals. \n\nThe Arizona/Sonora Regional Workgroup plan and coordinate activities at the regional level, develop biennial action plans, and support the efforts of local Task Forces.  Each Regional Workgroup has one state and one federal co-chair from environment agencies in each country, and work closely with the NADB to implement projects to fulfill the goals and objectives in Border 2020.  Local Task Forces have been created to identify priority issues and help facilitate pilot projects by engaging with local, state, and tribal governments; academia; NGOs; and the public.\n\nThe California/Baja California Regional Workgroup plan and coordinate activities at the regional level, develop biennial action plans, and support the efforts of local Task Forces.  Each Regional Workgroup has one state and one federal co-chair from environment agencies in each country, and work closely with the NADB to implement projects to fulfill the goals and objectives in Border 2020.  Local Task Forces have been created to identify priority issues and help facilitate pilot projects by engaging with local, state, and tribal governments; academia; NGOs; and the public.\n\nThe Four-State Region extends from the Coahuila-Chihuahua border in Mexico (when that border reaches the Rio Grande, it is in the Big Bend area) eastward to the Gulf of Mexico. The region includes parts of three states and a total of at least 29 municipalities on the Mexican side, and 168 cities and towns on the U.S. side. Recognizing this, the workgroup divided itself into three geographically based Task Forces-Amistad, Falcon, and Gulf, each of which has established subject-specific committees related to its priority concerns.\n\nThe Texas-New Mexico-Chihuahua region stretches approximately 500 miles (800 km) along the international boundary from the Coronado National Forest to Big Bend National Park and includes the following major sister cities: Columbus-Palomas, Las Cruces-El Paso-Ciudad Juarez, and Presidio-Ojinaga. Federal, state and tribal partners from the U.S. and Mexico serve as the co-chairs of the TX/NM/CHIH Regional Workgroup (RWG). The co-chairs support local Task Force efforts and coordinate activities at the regional and local levels.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

             "description": "This feature class contains parcel boundaries and their environmental covenant status within the Riverpark Subdivision in Lyon County, Nevada. An environmental covenant is an instrument used to define the appropriate activities and/or uses on real property that has been subject to contamination. It is a recordable instrument that is attached to the deed and runs with the property. It is almost always used on a property that was subject to clean-up action by a regulatory authority, either the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) or the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). In 2005 environmental covenants were created with the passage of Senate Bill No. 263 by the Nevada Legislature. The covenants meet a need to protect both the responsible party and regulatory agencies. Responsible parties must invest significant resources for removing contamination and constructing and maintaining engineering controls to limit the potential exposure from remnant contamination. Regulatory agencies on the other hand, such as NDEP or the US EPA, are responsible for enforcing and overseeing clean-up actions to assure protections remain in-place and are effective through their design life. The Riverpark subdivision is located within Operable Unit 1 of the Carson River Mercury Site (CRMS).",

             "description": "Soil investigation in the Riverpark subdivision took place over several phases. This feature class contains final grade samples taken in Phases III and IV. Resource Concepts, Inc. conducted the soil sampling on behalf of the developer Lennar Homes. All final reports were transmitted to NDEP.\n\nEach lot was sampled at two locations: one in the front yard and one in the back yard. One of the samples represented soils from 0 -1 foot below grade (fbg), and the other represented soils from 1- 2 fbg. Samples for each unit were taken over a span of several days. Sample date provided in the attribute table lists the final date of sampling. Sample date ranges for each unit are listed below:\n\nPhase III\nUnit 8: Samples were collected on December 28, 2004.\nUnit 11: Samples were collected between March 1 and March 6, 2006.\nUnit 12: Samples were collected between March 7 and March 9, 2006.\nUnit 13: Samples were collected between March 6 and March 15, 2006.\nUnit 14: Samples were collected on March 20, March 23, and March 24, 2006.\nUnit 15: Samples were collected between August 22 and August 28, 2006.\n\nPhase IV\nUnit 1: Samples were collected on October 10 and October 11, 2006.\nUnit 2: Samples were collected on October 25 and October 26, 2006.\nUnit 3: Samples were collected on April 3 and April 5, 2007.\nUnit 4: Samples were collected on November 28 and November 29, 2006.\n\nAll samples were surveyed in the field using a Trimble 5800 survey-grade GPS receiver tied into centerline monuments. All sample results below the 0.05 mg/kg detection limit are recorded as ND (Non-Detectable).\n\nSample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy of the following report figures:\n\nFigure 1-A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 1(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006), Figure 2-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 2(Summit Engineering Corp., modified October 9, 2006),Figure 3-A Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 3(Summit Engineering Corp., modified May 22, 2007),\n\nFigure 4- A, Official Plat of Riverpark Phase 4 Unit 4 (Summit Engineering Corp., modified November 27, 2006).\n\nFigure 8A, Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Figure 8B Final Subdivision for Riverpark Unit 8 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants, modified April 21, 2006); Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 7, 2006) and Final Subdivision for Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 14 (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 9, 2006).\n\nFigure 11-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 11 ( TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006);\n\nFigure 12-A Revised, Final Subdivision Plat for Riverpark Unit 12 (TEC Civil Engineering Consultants., modified March 29, 2006).\n\nFigure 13-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 13 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 29, 2006),\n\nFigure 15-A, Final Map of Riverpark Phase 3 Unit 15 for Riverpark Properties, LLC (Harlan King and Assocs., modified March 8, 2006).\n\nThese figures include the note \"Sample site locations are approximate relative to lot lines in this figure.\" Georeferencing of the sample locations included matching significant landmarks identified on the figures contained in the report to the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u00e2??s parcel map.\n\nReport figures and more information on field sampling procedures can be found in the following source documents:\n\nResource Concepts, Inc., Robin A.

Dynamap(R)/2000 County Boundary file with a shoreline buffer is a non-generalized polygon layer that represents all U.S. government-defined entities named County. A County is a type of governmental unit that is the primary legal subdivision of every U.S. state. This file contains a 'shoreline buffer' that extends out from the shoreline to the political limits of the census entity. The political limit is usually 12 miles or less from the shoreline into the abutting water feature. The cartographical representation of a shoreline buffer is visibly apparent for census areas that border the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThese features are incorporated in the San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund Story Map, an interactive series of maps and QlikSense graphics highlighting the competitive grant program which supports projects to protect and restore San Francisco Bay.

These samples were intended to represent the potential exposure of residents after home construction and the sampling program and design was performed in accordance with guidelines of the draft LTSRP in effect at that time. The following resources were used in compiling this dataset: Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., January 5, 2006, Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1, Final Sampling Results, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C. Report describes the collection of 445 samples collected after completion of finish grade on the Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 residential properties. The report states an additional 28 samples were collected and analyzed in this effort for quality assurance/quality control purposes. This report also briefly summarizes work performed in the 35 acre \u201cOld Pond\u201d area. The report includes a summary table of analytical results titled \u201cSanta (sic) Maria Ranch-Phase I Sampling at Final Lot Grade\u201d. Analytical results from this summary table were associated with the corresponding sample ID to the respective map location. Converse Consultants, drafted by KIB, December 23, 2005, Final Sample Locations, Figure No. 1, sample location plan accompanying January 5, 2006 report referenced above. Figure 1 shows proposed Santa Maria Ranch Phase 1 parcel boundaries, streets and open space. It also includes roughly 35 acres of contiguous land east of the residential development proposed to remain as open space. Figure 1 maps the locations of 445 sample locations described in the Final Sampling Results report. Sample locations were mapped by digitizing the original hardcopy Figure 1 and matching to significant landmarks in the CRMS geodatabase base map and current Lyon County Assessor\u2019s parcel map. Final samples were collected between March 2 and 15, 2005. The sample date in the attribute table refers to the final date of the sampling period. After final sampling completed, 10 additional lots were identified that required additional fill. Samples were collected in these lots on November 28 and 30, 2005.",

Tentative map of planned subdivision residential parcel and planned infrastructure lay-out, Pezonella Associates March 28, 2003 letter report identifies the sample locations of the preliminary investigation by lot numbers identified on this tentative map. This tentative map was georeferenced and samples were located by arbitrarily placing the sample point at the centroid of lot sampled. Three control points were used in georeferencing with a first order polynomial transformation. For quality control, proposed lot boundaries on the tentative map were compared to existing parcel boundaries from the Lyon County Assessor\u2019s office. The lot numbers associated with each sample point correspond to the original lot numbers as identified in the \"Tentative Map for Santa Maria Ranch\", produced by Western Engineering and Surveying Services in 2003. Lot numbers have since changed. The current lot numbers are indicated in the Santa Maria Ranch Phase I Parcels feature class.",

             "description": "This feature class depicts the locations and analytical data for the soil samples taken by Converse Consultants in 2009. These samples represent a preliminary site characterization and the sample design was biased to the Town Ditch where it ran through the proposed development. Converse Consultants believed this diversion ditch represented a \"most likely\" source of contamination within the proposed development as it diverted water and sediment from the Carson River in vicinity of Winter Ranch. NDEP provided comment to the proposed sample design and additional sample locations were added. The following resources were used in compiling this dataset: Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., January 19, 2009, Soil Sampling, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C., Unpublished. Preliminary soil sampling conducted prior to development. Sampling in this investigation restricted to 9 locations located within the former Town Ditch. Two soil samples analyzed from each location representing 0 to 1ft below ground surface and 1 to 2 ft below ground surface. Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., June 30, 2009, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to David Friedman, NDEP, Unpublished. This letter transmits the GPS coordinates of the 9 locations of the soil samples collected from the Town Ditch and provides explanation of the sample design rationale as requested by NDEP. Converse Consultants, Kathi Brandmueller, P.E., C.E.M., December 10, 2009, Soil Sampling, Santa Maria Ranch Subdivision, Phase II, Dayton, Nevada, letter to Dale Denio, Dayton Land Developers, L.L.C., Unpublished. Preliminary soil sampling conducted prior to development. This report of a supplemental investigation to the work reported in the January 19, 2009 document. The supplemental study was conducted at the request of NDEP after reviewing the January 19, 2009 findings report and sample design rationale described by Converse Consultants in the June 30, 2009 letter. NDEP requested additional samples be collected from three other areas with potential contamination within the proposed SMR Phase II study area. These areas of suspected contamination include Daney Canyon drainage, the Carson River 100-year floodplain and the historic Ophir Mill site. Near surface soil samples collected near the Ophir Mill site with high levels of mercury detected were reported in the CRMS OU1 RI. Five additional locations were sampled in this supplemental study. Two soil samples analyzed from each location representing 0 to 1ft below ground surface and 1 to 2 ft below ground surface. GPS coordinates for the 5 additional locations were provided in this report. ",

             "description": "The primary purpose of the sediment collection was to obtain vertical profile information from several areas in which no data existed and/or to compare with existing data to demonstrate the mercury and metals deposition resulting from the Comstock-era release (i.e., beginning in the 1860s). The specific areas targeted in the field work were from the Lahontan Reservoir, Sheckler Lake, and downstream areas potentially impacted by the historic river flows prior to construction of Lahontan Reservoir.  In 2015, the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir were at historic low levels as a result of a four-year drought.  This presented the agency access to collect sediment core samples from areas that were normally below the waterline. EPA\u2019s principal study question was whether mercury is indeed sediment bound and that Lahontan Reservoir, since it construction in 1915, serves as a mercury sink.  The secondary purpose of the sediment sampling effort was to collect a range of mercury concentrations for assessing field screening equipment using Thermal Decomposition, Amalgamation, and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (See EPA SW7473) and comparing the results to laboratory analytical data.  The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

These sister cities highlight the areas along the border that contain the most dense populations. Data was gathered by Jacoup Roiz from Google Maps GPS coordinates in 2019.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

             "description": "This is a summary of mercury (Hg) data from the Lahontan Reservoir area of the Carson River Basin.  USBR provided an information overview and reference source on mercury (Hg) in soils for water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. These data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan Reservoir area, focused on the camp sites and the beaches, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada.\n\nRunoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink. This area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow.\n\nWhen Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI, for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues. The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment. ",

Plans call for the program to be applied throughout the U.S. Initially, however, several pilot studies were established in diverse drainage basins to develop techniques for use in both groundwater and surface water studies. The Carson River Basin, Churchill and Lyon Counties, Nevada, is a  pilot study area for groundwater. The Carson River originates on the east flank of the Sierra Nevada mountains and drains eastward to terminate in the Carson Sink. This report presents data from that study.\n\nOne of the objectives of the study is to investigate the relationship between water quality and the composition of the solid mineral material in contact with the water. A regional assessment of the geochemistry of surficial materials was obtained by soil samples. Subsurface assessment was obtained from drill core of shallow (at least to the depth of the water table) wells drilled specifically for this study.\n\nBoth groundwater and solid materials were sampled, but this report contains the analytical data only for the solid mineral materials that were collected. All analyses were performed in laboratories of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Denver, CO.",

             "description": "The Carson River is a vital water resource for local municipalities and migratory birds travelling the Pacific Flyway. Historic mining practices that used mercury (Hg) to extract gold from Comstock Lode ore has left much of the river system heavily contaminated with Hg, a practice that continues in many parts of the world today.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2013, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) collected and analyzed Carson River water for Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations resulting in a sixteen-year record of unfiltered total mercury (uf.THg), filtered (dissolved) Hg (f.THg), total methylmercury(uf.MeHg), filtered MeHg (f.MeHg), and particulate-bound THg (p.THg) and MeHg (p.MeHg) concentrations. This represents one of the longest continuous records of Hg speciation data for any riverine system, thereby providing a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term trends in concentrations and annual loads. During the period of analysis, uf.THg concentration and load trended downward at rates of 0.85% and 1.8% per year, respectively. Conversely, the f.THg concentration increased at a rate of 1.7% per year between 1998 and 2005, and 4.9% per year between 2005 and 2013. Trends inflow-normalized partition coefficients for both Hg and MeHg suggest a statistically significant shift from the particulate to thefiltered phase. The upwardly accelerating f.THg concentration and observed shift from the solid phase tothe aqueous phase among the pools of Hg and MeHg within the river water column signals an increased risk of deteriorating ecological conditions in the lower basin with respect to Hg contamination.\n\nMore broadly, the 16-year trend analysis, completed 140 years after the commencement of major Hg releases to the Carson River, provides a poignant example of the ongoing legacy left behind by gold and silver mining techniques that relied on Hg amalgamation, and a cautionary tale for regions still pursuing the practice in other countries.  EPA funded work from 1997 through 2013.\n\nSamples were collected at the Weeks Bridge location from April 1997 through February 1999, and at seven other Carson River locations from April 1998 through February 1999, and at Weeks Bridge and below Lahontan Reservoir from 2000 through 2013.  Assist EPA in studying the transport of mercury-contaminated water and sediment in the Carson River system in western Nevada.  The study included periodic measurements of streamflow, and the collection and analysis of water samples for total mercury, methylmercury, and suspended sediment at two Carson River locations.  The study also included field measurements and the collection and analysis of samples from the north basin of Lahontan Reservoir.\n\nEPA used the data to determine loadings of the dissolved and particulate fractions of total mercury and methylmercury into and from Lahontan Reservoir, to better understand sources and transformations of mercury in the Carson River system, evaluate the effects of reservoir stratification on methylmercury production, and ultimately to help determine whether remedial action is warranted to reduce the levels of mercury contamination in and near the Carson River. A journal article from Eric Morway, Carl Thodal and Mark Marvin-DiPascuale, USGS,  summarizing the findings is entitled \"Morway_Thodal_MMD_HgMeHg_2017.pdf\".  This study, a component of the Remedial Investigation for the Carson River Superfund Site, included collection and analysis of water samples for total mercury\u00a0and\u00a0methylmercury\u00a0from Weeks Bridge\u00a0above Lahontan Reservoir, located on the\u00a0Carson River.\u00a0The USGS Water Science Center has collected and analyzed water samples in the Carson River system through an Interagency Agreement with EPA. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.

             "description": "The primary purpose of the surface water collection was to correlate methylmercury information with sediment core data from several areas in which no data existed and/or to compare with existing data to demonstrate the mercury and metals deposition resulting from the Comstock-era release (i.e., beginning in the 1860s). The specific areas targeted in the field work were from the Lahontan Reservoir, Sheckler Lake, and downstream areas potentially impacted by the historic river flows prior to construction of Lahontan Reservoir.  In 2015, the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir were at historic low levels as a result of a four-year drought.  This presented the agency access to collect sediment core samples from areas that were normally below the waterline. EPA\u2019s principal study question was whether mercury is indeed sediment bound and that Lahontan Reservoir, since it construction in 1915, serves as a mercury sink.  The secondary purpose of the sediment sampling effort was to collect a range of mercury concentrations for assessing field screening equipment using Thermal Decomposition, Amalgamation, and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (See EPA SW7473) and comparing the results to laboratory analytical data.  The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.  Data was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.",

In addition to this water quality investigation a separate project plan was initiated to address uptake of contaminates into vegetation (cattails) consumed by Tribal members. Sediment and plant material were collected from Reservation wetlands and analyzed for metals, radioactivity and organochlorine pesticides to test if there is a correlation between surface water, sediments and plant uptake.

This study used the same base transect line (located north of the runway) created for the WCFS survey in 1997 so that any locations with detections could be spatially related to new detections. The event consisted of using portable hand-held augering equipment to collect soil samples from depths of 3 to 5 ft bgs. These samples were taken from areas that had been determined to have subsurface anomalies during the WCFS survey. A total of 37 soil samples were collected and analyzed for total PCBs, lead, chromium, cadmium, and mercury. No PCBs were detected in the soils above the detection limit of 2 mg/kg (URS, 1999). One sample showed elevated lead concentrations of 939 mg/kg. Baseline lead values were determined to be approximately 23.4 mg/kg in soil at Tern Island (URS, 1999).",

USDA-NRCS-National Geospatial Center of Excellence acquired this dataset from the NOAA-Pacific Services Center. NOAA has purchased a Enterprise Premium license for this Orthoimagery dataset from DigitalGlobe, Inc. Any government, education, not-for-profit agency and public/individuals not engaged in using the \"Product for Commercial Exploitation or Commercial Purposes\" can use this licensed data. Use of this product for Commercial Purposes by a person/company/organization for a profit or fee is strictly prohibited. This dataset cannot be re-sold. Please refer to the separately attached license from DigitalGlobe, Inc. for additional information. Digital orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a digital image with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary dynamic digital orthophoto is a 50 centimeter ground resolution, image cast to the customer specified projection and datum defined in the Spatial Reference Information section of this metadata document. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and ensure full coverage if the imagery is reprojected. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. DigitalGlobe WorldView-2 Satellite Orthoimagery was delivered to NOAA in GeoTIFF file format. This specific dataset was delivered to NOAA orthorectified to scale 1:12,000. This GeoTIFF composite contains the following four Multi-Spectral bands: Band 1: Blue (450 - 510 nm), Band 2: Green (510 - 580 nm), Band 3: Red (625 - 690 nm) and (585 - 625 nm) and Band 4: Color Infrared 1/NIR 1 (770 - 895 nm).",

Six years of below normal precipitation left much of the reservoir dry during the summer, 1992, and allowed for the precise delineation and mapping of the stratigraphic units that underlie Lahontan Reservoir.\n\nThe units were defined on the basis of spatial and topographic position, grain-size, composition, and the presence or absence of weathering zones. Once delineated, the units were mapped on 1: 12,000 scale aerial photographs. Subsequently, the photographic data were transferred to a stable base map for interpretation and analysis. Twelve stratigraphic units have been defined, nine of which post-date dam construction in 1915. One post-dam unit was deposited by eolian processes, while the remaining eight represent sedimentation in three lacustrine depositional environments: coastal, deep-water, and deltaic.",

Bus, commuter and light rail, and trolley routes managed and developed from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data available from the transitland feed registry (formerly from GTFS Data Exchange). Routes are developed from the GTFS data available through the transitland feed registry (https://transit.land/feed-registry/), formerly from the GTFS Data Exchange. GTFS data is provided to the exchange by the transit agencies and processed by SanGIS to create a consolidated GIS layer containing routes from both systems. SanGIS uses a publicly available ESRI ArcToolbox tool to create the GIS data layer. The toolbox can be found at http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=14189102b795412a85bc5e1e09a0bafa. This data set is created using the ROUTES.txt and SHAPES.txt GTFS data files.Routes layers for MTS and NCTD are created separately and combined into a single layer using ArcGIS tools.",

R9 tribal boundaries were acquired from the R9 Technology and Data Solutions Center are are based on data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Pacific Region Office and the AZ/NV Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Surface Management office. Tribal layers for both regions were merged and clipped to the border region for use in the U.S. - Mexico Border Program Application.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

             "description": "American Samoa's primary industry is tuna processing by the Samoa Packing Co., user of the \"Chicken of the Sea\" label, and StarKist Samoa. Canneries thrive in this tiny U.S. territory because they allow Asian fishing companies to avoid U.S. import tariffs of up to 35 percent on processed fish. Goods have duty- and quota-free entry to the United States if 30 percent of their value is added in the territory. Federal law prohibits foreign commercial fishing vessels from offloading tuna at U.S. ports; however, American Samoa is exempted. Thus the greater part of the South Pacific tuna catch is landed here, supplying the United States with the bulk of its canned tuna, worth US$500 million a year. In aggregate, the canneries contribute about US$25 million a year to the local economy in wages, and spend another US$40 million on support services, fuel, and provisioning.",

The extent of the area was agreed upon between the United States and Mexico under the 1983 La Paz Agreement. The framework of this agreement stated that the border area is defined as \"the area situated 62 miles (100 kilometers) on either side of the inland and maritime boundaries\". This layer was generated by buffering the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data  (HIFLD) \"Mexico and US Border\" layer (https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::mexico-and-us-border/about) by [60] Miles.\n\nThese data support the U.S.-Mexico Border Program Map, which highlights the projects funded through the U.S.-Mexico Border Program (2013-2020) in both Region 9 and Region 6 of the U.S. EPA, including U.S. Federally recognized Tribal communities and states of Texas, New Mexico, Chihuahua, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, California, Baja California, Sonora, and Arizona within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of the U.S.-Mexico Border. The projects stem from the Border 2020 framework that has five goals to reduce air pollution, improve access to clean water, promote materials and waste management, improve emergency preparedness, and enhance environmental stewardship, and fundamental strategies that includes children's health and environmental education and outreach.\n\nFor more information about Border 2020 and/or current U.S.-Mexico Border program visit this website: https://www.epa.gov/usmexicoborder ",

             "description": "Location and descriptions of marine debris observed by the Sailing Vessel (S/V) Family Affair yacht during the Victoria, British Columbia to Maui, Hawaii Yacht Race in July 2012. These observations are organized according to the following map layers: Family Affairs Observations, Fleet Debris Levels, Return Vessels Special Reports, Roll Call Debris Data-Race, Special Report Debris-Race, Vessel Specific Observations, and Return Vessel Specific Levels Observations. The March, 2011 tsunami that affected northern Japan washed enormous amounts of debris out to sea. While most of this debris sank quickly out at sea, much remains on the surface and by ocean current and wind is working its way across the Pacific Ocean. In early days, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) could track the debris slick by satellite, but by early 2012, the debris had become too dispersed to track. News stories have reported containers with motorcycles on Haida Gwaii, whole fishing boats in Alaska, and sections of concrete dock in Oregon. Recent reports are about the struggles of local governments to deal with cleaning up and disposing of flotsam washing up on local beaches.",

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).\n\nAn incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.\n\nThe boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\n\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\n\nThe boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.\n\nNDEP extracted the Virginia City Census-Designated Place boundary polygon from the TIGER/Line database in 2020.",

List of dairies located in California that do not use anaerobic digesters to produce biogas, and estimates of how much biogas could be produced if these dairies were to use anaerobic digesters to manage dairy waste. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board provided EPA Region 9 with herd size data by from their 2005 General Waste Discharge annual report (contact person at the Water Quality Control Board: Doug Patterson, Doug.Patteson@waterboards.ca.gov). List of food processing facilities (in NV, AZ, CA, HI) producing waste that could be used for co-digestion at wastewater treatment facilities and other entities with anaerobic digesters. The facilities included were based on a list of businesses classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as food manufacturing businesses. Dunn and Bradstreet compiled the list in 2010 per the request by the EPA. List of Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) with anaerobic digesters in Arizona. The list of facilities was obtained from the annual biosolids report required under 40 CFR 503 (Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge) for WWTF with influent flows over 1 million gallons per day. Original data set was based on 2004 reporting, which was the last year Arizona WWTFs were required to report to the EPA, but was partially updated based on direct communication between EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program and some of the WWTFs. List of Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFs) with anaerobic digesters (in NV, HI). The list of facilities was obtained from the annual biosolids report required under 40 CFR 503 (Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge) for WWTFs with influent flows over 1 million gallons per day. The data used by the Waste to Biogas Mapping tool can and have been updated based on request through a web interface and by the EPA Region 9 Sustainable Infrastructure program. California Organic Collection Programs: List of organic collection programs in California that have the potential to provide waste for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. A study conducted by New Found Lands Institute in 2008 with a grant provided by EPA Region 9 was the source of the information about organic collection programs. List of Fat, Oil, and Grease (FOG) hauling and rendering companies serving locations in the State of California and that have the potential to provide FOG for co-digestion at Wastewater Treatment Facilities and other entities that use anaerobic digesters. EPA Region 9\u2019s Sustainable Infrastructure program obtained the data from the CalFOG website in 2009.

The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the closed terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink.\n\nThis area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. This data was collected to help achieve goals set by the CWA that requires individual States to identify impaired water bodies and create enforceable WQ objectives to protect surface water quality within State bounds (CWA Sections 303d and 305 b).  These objectives were to focus on priority toxic pollutants, pursuant to CWA Section 307a. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.  Literature and other source Hg data are summarized in the RI, for surface waters, sediments, and biological tissues.  The report contains the Human Health Risk Assessment and Ecological Risk Assessment.  ",

Lead is a heavy metal that is often found in urban soil. It usually comes from sources such as chipped paint on pre-1978 housing, historic pollution from leaded gas, or lead recycling (smelting). Children exposed to lead can have health problems, including impaired brain and physical development. In June 2018, EPA and DTSC took soil samples in city-owned property along streets, not private property, at nearly 200 randomly selected locations across West Oakland. This area was selected because of its mix of possible sources of lead, including industry, older homes that may be painted with leaded paint and nearby freeways.",

Under the auspices of the Truckee-Carson-Pyramid Lake Water Settlement Agreement, the Department of the Interior has implemented a program to acquire rights for water to restore and maintain a portion of the historic wetlands in Lahontan Valley. Although inflow to wetlands will be partially restored, the effects of increased inflow to wetland contamination is uncertain.\n\nIn 1990, the Nevada State Office, in conjunction with Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), instituted a monitoring program on Stillwater NWR to assess implications of inorganic contaminants to fish, wildlife, and human health and to assess changes in inorganic contaminant concentrations in wetlands maintained With freshwater and agricultural drainage water. This program entailed the measurement of water quality parameters and the determination of trace element concentrations in water, sediment, and biological matrices.

             "description": "The current conceptual site model (CSM) includes data gaps related to the extent of mercury contamination throughout the site, as well as the presence of other metal contaminants in soil. This study focuses on three areas in OU01: the Six Mile Canyon Area in Dayton, NV, the California Pan Mill Area in Virginia City, NV, and the Sacramento Mill Area just north of Virginia City, NV.  Surface and near surface soils with COC concentration greater than the project action limits present a potential risk for direct contact and soil migration. Data gaps exist in the understanding the sources, extent, and migration pathways of contaminants at this area and the applicability of the Incremental Sampling (IS) and (X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) approach to comply with the LTSRP. The project will address these data gaps through incremental sampling and real time XRF.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the IS Study where field sample collection techniques were evaluated as part of this study using XRF. Sample processing included seiving, to compare ISM with the current LTSRP method based on four five-point composite samples per residential parcel. The goal to is to validate the CSM and improve the screening of vast areas of mercury-contaminated soils while continuing to evaluate the performance of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation for the simultaneous analysis of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) in soil affected by the mining operations associated with the Comstock Lode. however sample processing will be. The most effective processing and analytical techniques will be selected for use in a follow-up study which will evaluate field sample collection. It is anticipated that the most effective and efficient sampling and analysis techniques will be incorporated into future investigations for the Carson River area.\n\nGeneral Comments: The location coordinates represent the center point of the Decision Unit (DU) as calculated by GIS. For DUs that cross roads or driveways (SMCD2 and SMCSCR-South) the midpoint may plot in the middle of the road. The center point for SMCCBS was selected manually due to the unusual shape of the DU. The calculated GIS center point falls outside of the DU.  DU columns provided on each tab for easy sorting and QC check. It is not a critical data point since the DU name is embedded in the Sample ID. For Source Units (SU) samples, the DU column is N/A if the SU was located outside of a DU, this column is filled out if the SU was located inside of a DU. Date represents sample collection date.\n  \nTab-Specific Comments: XRF field results did not use unique Lab ID sample #s so left that column blank. Did not establish specific XRF reporting limits for this project. Manually added a \u201cU\u201d for the XRF ND samples to match the lab formats.

EPA\u2019s map only displays municipalities with CSO outfalls, whereas CT DEEP\u2019s map includes municipalities with CSO-related bypasses at their Wastewater Treatment Facilities (but no Combined Sewer Collection System CSO outfalls). EPA\u2019s map only displays CSO outfalls \u2013 the point at which CSOs are discharged to the receiving water - whereas CT DEEP\u2019s map includes CSO regulators (the structure through which wastewater and stormwater exits the conveyance pipe towards the Wastewater Treatment Facility).\n\nMaine: Service containing both facility and outfall locations permitted under the Maine Pollution Elimination System (MEPDES) and administered by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP). The data has been collected using multiple methods over 2 decades under the direction of the Maine DEP GIS Unit. All location data was quality checked by MEDEP MEPDES Inspectors and GIS Unit staff in 2018.\n\nMassachusetts: Attribute and location information from a combination of MassDEP CSOs(https://mass-eoeea.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=08c0019270254f0095a0806b155abcde) (metadata - https://mass-eoeea.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0262b339c2c74213bdaaa15adccc0e96) and NPDES permits(https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/massachusetts-final-individual-npdes-permits).\n\nNew Hampshire: Active CSO outfalls collected from NH NPDES permits(https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/new-hampshire-final-individual-npdes-permits). EPA made corrections based upon updated information available in EPA\u2019s files.\n\nRhode Island: RI CSO Outfall Point Features. The outfalls managed by the Narragansett Bay Commission are downloadable from a GIS file through RIGIS (Rhode Island Geographic Information System https://www.rigis.org/datasets/nbc-sewer-overflows/explore?location=41.841121%2C-71.414224%2C13.57&showTable=true). Data was intended for use in utility facility engineering structure inventory. Last updated: 2019. Downloaded: 11/19/2021.

Point, line, and polygon data was collected and compiled through field observations, municipal member knowledge, ortho-photo interpretation, digitization of georeferenced town plans and record drawings, and state stormwater permit plans.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), among other things, helps ensure that wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner so as to protect human health and the environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal. EPA and 44 authorized states and territories run the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action program to work with hazardous waste facilities to investigate and clean up any release of hazardous waste into the soil, ground water, surface water and air. In general, all generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous waste are required to provide information about their activities to state environmental agencies. These agencies, in turn pass on the information to regional and national EPA offices. Accidents or other activities at facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes have sometimes led to the release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into soil, ground water, surface water, or air. When that happens, the RCRA Corrective Action program is one program that may be used to accomplish the necessary cleanup. This data set provides boundaries for those areas where cleanup activities are underway. RCRA CABs and cleanup boundaries are meant to include the various boundaries associated with a site, including: institutional controls, engineering controls, land use controls, anticipated/acceptable use limitations, operable units, as well as the site or facility boundaries.",

The files in the geodatabase are: Cat2_SLR0_Int_Feet_dissolve_Mattapoisett: Current Category 2 hurricane with 0 ft sea level rise Cat4_SLR0_Int_Feet_dissolve_Mattapoisett: Current Category 4 hurricane with 0 ft sea level rise Cat4_SLR4_Int_Feet_dissolve_Mattapoisett: Future Category 4 hurricane with 4 feet sea level rise The features support the Weather Ready Mattapoisett story map, which can be accessed via the following link: https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=1ff4f1d28a254cb689334799d94b74e2",

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. Compilation of the level IV maps, performed at 1:250,000 scale, has been a part of collaborative projects between US Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL)--Corvallis, OR, the US Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and a variety of other state and federal resource agencies. The ecoregions and subregions are designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management. The most immediate needs by the states are for developing regional biological criteria and water resource standards, and for setting management goals for nonpoint-source pollution. Level IV ecoregions are intended for large geographic extents (i.e. states, multiple counties, or river basins). Use for smaller areas, such as individual counties or a 1:24,000 scale map boundary, is not recommended. Explanation of the methods used to delineate the ecoregions are given in Omernik (1995), Griffith et al. (1994), and Gallant et al. (1989).
