This information was then evaluated to quantitatively characterize assay reliability (repeatability and reproducibility) and evaluate potential user bias associated with the methods.  Additional calculations were performed using established models to estimate in vivo levels of hepatic clearance and predict the effects on chemical biotransformation on chemical bioaccumulation.

-            "description": "The National Training Center (NTC) at US Army Fort Irwin, CA (Fort Irwin) has a stormwater collection system located near the Sleepy Hollow housing area that includes a stormwater catchment basin, controlled release of flood waters, and enhanced local infiltration by a drywell. The system was not performing to design standards and best management practices. To research wet-weather capture and aquifer recharge, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contracted GeoSystems Analysis, Inc. (GSA) to supervise the drilling and installation of a vadose zone testing well (Test Well) and a groundwater monitoring well (Monitor Well) at the Sleepy Hollow drywell site at Fort Irwin. Additionally, GSA contracted Torrent Resources Inc. (Phoenix, AZ) (Torrent Resources) to upgrade the drywell site.\n\nThe Test Well was instrumented with water and air piezometers to allow testing of the infiltration capacity of the on-site basin fill deposits and derive hydraulic conductivity properties for these materials through intermediate and large-scale field testing and laboratory testing. Water piezometers were used to conduct borehole permeameter tests to provide an estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at the testing intervals. Air piezometers were used to conduct atmospheric pressure wave testing, which measures the bulk air permeability of vadose zone sediments in the vicinity of the well. Air permeability estimates can then be converted to estimates of water permeability. A water level and temperature sensor was also installed in one of the water piezometers to measure the depth of perched groundwater.\n\nThe Monitor Well was drilled to depths reaching the groundwater table to monitor the performance of the new drywell system. The Monitor Well also included a shallow piezometer installed above a low-permeability fine-grained sediment layer. Water level and temperature sensors were installed to measure the depth to groundwater and depth of perched water above the fine-grained layers. In addition, soil water content, electrical conductivity, and temperature sensors were installed at various depths in the vadose zone to monitor advancement of wetting fronts.\n\n",

Here, an ensemble\u2010based Kalman filter (KF) technique is developed primarily for nonrural areas with approximately 500 surface observation sites for PM2.5 and applied to three (GEOS\u2010Chem, WRF\u2010Chem, and WRF\u2010CMAQ) chemical transport model (CTM) hindcast outputs for June 2012. While all CTMs underestimate daily surface PM2.5 mass concentration by 20\u201350%, KF correction is effective for improving each CTM forecast. Subsequently, two ensemble methods are formulated: (1) the arithmetic mean ensemble (AME) that equally weights each model and (2) the optimized ensemble (OPE) that calculates the individual model weights by minimizing the least\u2010square errors. While the OPE shows superior performance than the AME, the combination of either the AME or the OPE with a KF performs better than the OPE alone, indicating the effectiveness of the KF technique. Overall, the combination of a KF with the OPE shows the best results. Lastly, the Successive Correction Method (SCM) was applied to spread the bias correction from model grids with surface PM2.5 observations to the grids lacking ground observations by using a radius of influence of 125 km derived from surface observations, which further improves the forecast of surface PM2.5 at the national scale.

-            "description": "Nitrate and sulfate are two key components of airborne particulate matter (PM). While multiple formation mechanisms have been proposed for sulfate, current air quality models commonly underestimate its concentrations and mass fractions during northern China winter haze events. On the other hand, current models usually overestimate the mass fractions of nitrate. Very recently, laboratory studies have proposed that nitrous acid (N(III)) produced by particulate nitrate photolysis can oxidize sulfur dioxide to produce sulfate. Here, for the first time, we parameterize this heterogeneous mechanism into the state-of-the-art Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and quantify its contributions to sulfate formation. We find that the significance of this mechanism mainly depends on the enhancement effects (by 1\u20133 orders of magnitude as suggested by the available experimental studies) of nitrate photolysis rate constant (\"J\" _(\u3016\"NO\" \u3017_\"3\" ^- )) in aerosol liquid water compared to that in the gas phase. Comparisons between model simulations and in-situ observations in Beijing suggest that this pathway can explain about 15% (assuming an enhancement factor (EF) of 10) to 65% (assuming EF = 100) of the model\u2013observation gaps in sulfate concentrations during winter haze. Our study strongly calls for future research on reducing the uncertainty in EF.

Two data processing approaches were integrated to automate the calculations of fuel consumption-based emission factors of nitrogen oxides (NOX). With a total of 245 plume chasing tests conducted, and then averaged by vehicle and road types, we found that the relative errors of vehicle-specific emission factors using an algorithm developed for this project were within approximately \u00b1 20% of the PEMS results for all tested vehicles. Stochastic simulations suggested reasonable results could be obtained using fewer chasing tests per vehicle (e.g., 71% for freeways and 93% for local road, equivalent to two chase tests per vehicle). This study improves the understanding of the accuracy of the mobile chasing method, and provides a practical approach for real-time emission measurements for future scaled-up mobile chasing studies. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publications:\nWu, Y., H.

Zeta potential values were measured for Bacillus globgii and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, two common surrogates used to represent Bacillus anthracis, in synthetic baseline ultrapure water and laboratory stormwater. Zeta potential curves were also determined for materials representative of urban infrastructure (concrete and asphalt). These data were used to predict the interaction energy between the spores and urban materials using Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) modeling. B. globgii and B. thuringiensis kurstaki sourced from Yakibou Inc., were found to have similar zeta potential curves, whereas spores sourced from the U.S. military\u2019s Dugway laboratory were found to diverge. In the ultrapure water, the energy barriers between the spores and the urban materials were tunable through compression of the double layer of the\nspores via changes of ionic strength and pH of the water. In the runoff water, charge neutralization dominated surface processes. The cations, metals, and natural organic matter (NOM) in the runoff water contributed to equalizing the zeta potential values for Dugway B. globgii and B. thuringiensis kurstaki, and drastically modified the surface of the concrete and asphalt. All DLVO energy curves using the runoff water were repulsive. The highest energy barrier predicted in this study was for Dugway B. globgii spores interacting with a concrete surface in runoff water, suggesting that this would be the most challenging combination to detach through water-based decontamination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMikelonis, A., K.

Prevalence estimates were calculated using a two-stage approach. The first stage used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to predict high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (\u2265126 mg/dL) and/or hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels (\u22656.5% [48 mmol/mol]) based on self-reported demographic and behavioral characteristics (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). This model was then applied to Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to impute high FPG and/or A1C status for each BRFSS respondent (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). The second stage used the imputed BRFSS data to fit a series of small area models, which were used to predict the county-level prevalence of each of the diabetes-related outcomes (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). Diagnosed diabetes was defined as the proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who reported a previous diabetes diagnosis, represented as an age-standardized prevalence percentage. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who have a high FPG or HbA1C but did not report a previous diagnosis of diabetes. Total diabetes was defined as the proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who reported a previous diabetes diagnosis and/or had a high FPG/HbA1C. The age-standardized diabetes prevalence (%) was used as the outcome.\n\nThe EQI was constructed for 2000-2005 for all US counties and is composed of five domains (air, water, built, land, and sociodemographic), each composed of variables to represent the environmental quality of that domain. Domain-specific EQIs were developed using principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce these variables within each domain while the overall EQI was constructed from a second PCA from these individual domains (L. C. Messer et al., 2014). To account for differences in environment across rural and urban counties, the overall and domain-specific EQIs were stratified by rural urban continuum codes (RUCCs) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).

Estrone (E1), a natural steroid, is found in aquatic environments sometimes at relatively high concentrations. However, E1 has been less thoroughly studied than 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) or 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol due in part to a relatively lower potency in metabolically-limited estrogen receptor (ER) binding/activation assays. Recent evidence suggests that in vivo biotransformation of E1 to E2 may occur in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) residing in environments with high concentrations of E1, such as near wastewater treatment plants. The enzymes likely responsible for this biotransformation, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17\u03b2HSDs), have been well characterized in mammals but to a lesser extent in fish species. In the current study, a novel systematic analysis of amino acid sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database demonstrated that multiple 17\u03b2HSD isoforms are conserved across different fish species. Experimentally, we showed that metabolically-active hepatic cytosolic preparations from two commercially important salmonid species, rainbow trout and lake trout, biotransformed E1 to E2 to a degree sufficient to alter results of competitive ER binding assays. These results from in silico and in vitro analyses indicate E1 and biotransformation may play a significant role in the feminization of a variety of fish species in contaminated aquatic environments. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nTapper, M., R.

Race-sex-stratified models were used to examine the associations among e25, rurality and specific race proportion, adjusted for socioeconomic variables. Individual death data from the National Center for Health Statistics were aggregated as death counts into five-year age groups by county and race-sex groups for the contiguous US for years 2000-2005 (National Center for Health Statistics 2000-2005). We used bridged-race population estimates to calculate five-year mortality rates. The bridged population data mapped 31 race categories, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards (the same as race categories in mortality registration) (Ingram et al. 2003). The urban-rural gradient was represented by the 2003 Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), which distinguished metropolitan counties by population size, and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area (United States Department of Agriculture 2016). We obtained county-level sociodemographic data for 2000-2005 from the US Census Bureau. These included median household income, percent of population attaining greater than high school education (high school%), and percent of county occupied rental units (rent%). We obtained county violent crime from Uniform Crime Reports and used it to calculate mean number of violent crimes per capita (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2010).

In this study, we examined the influence of maternal HFD on metabolic responses to ozone in young Long-Evans rat offspring. F0-females began control (CD; 10%kcal from fat) or high-fat diet (HFD; 60%kcal from fat) at post-natal day (PND)-30. Rats were bred on PND-72 and allowed to give birth. Dietary regimen was maintained until PND-30 and then all offspring were switched to CD. On PND-40, female and male offspring-F1 (n=10/group) were exposed to air or 0.8-ppm ozone for 5h and within 1h serum samples were collected for neuroendocrine hormones and global metabolomic analysis. Offspring from HFD-dams had increased body fat and weight relative to CD, however, no major changes in circulating hormones were noted. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant sex, diet, and exposure-related changes in metabolites. Maternal HFD increased free fatty acids and decreased phospholipids (female>male). Also, microbiome-associated histidine and tyrosine metabolites were increased in both sexes of offspring, while 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels decreased in males. Ozone exposure increased free fatty acids in males from CD-dams but decreased in females from HFD-dams. Ozone also decreased monohydroxy fatty acids and acyl carnitines in females (HFD>CD). Moreover, it increased pyruvate along with TCA cycle intermediates in females suggesting an increase in glucose utilization. Ozone increased various amino acids, polyamines and metabolites of gut microbiota in HFD female offspring. Collectively, these data suggest that maternal HFD increases offspring susceptibility to metabolic alterations in a sex-specific manner when challenged with environmental stressors. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSnow, S., K.

-            "description": "We present the development of a multiphase adjoint for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, a widely used chemical transport model. The adjoint model provides location- and time-specific gradients that can be used in various applications such as backward sensitivity analysis, source attribution, optimal pollution control, data assimilation, and inverse modeling. The science processes of the CMAQ model include gas-phase chemistry, aerosol dynamics and thermodynamics, cloud chemistry and dynamics, diffusion, and advection. Discrete adjoints are implemented for all the science processes, with an additional continuous adjoint for advection. The development of discrete adjoints is assisted with algorithmic differentiation (AD) tools. Particularly, the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) is implemented for gas-phase and aqueous chemistry, and two different automatic differentiation tools are used for other processes such as clouds, aerosols, diffusion, and advection. The continuous adjoint of advection is developed manually. For adjoint validation, the brute-force or finite-difference method (FDM) is implemented process by process with box- or column-model simulations. Due to the inherent limitations of the FDM caused by numerical round-off errors, the complex variable method (CVM) is adopted where necessary. The adjoint model often shows better agreement with the CVM than with the FDM. The adjoints of all science processes compare favorably with the FDM and CVM. In an example application of the full multiphase adjoint model, we provide the first estimates of how emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) affect public health across the US.

+            "description": "We present the development of a multiphase adjoint for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, a widely used chemical transport model. The adjoint model provides location- and time-specific gradients that can be used in various applications such as backward sensitivity analysis, source attribution, optimal pollution control, data assimilation, and inverse modeling. The science processes of the CMAQ model include gas-phase chemistry, aerosol dynamics and thermodynamics, cloud chemistry and dynamics, diffusion, and advection. Discrete adjoints are implemented for all the science processes, with an additional continuous adjoint for advection. The development of discrete adjoints is assisted with algorithmic differentiation (AD) tools. Particularly, the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) is implemented for gas-phase and aqueous chemistry, and two different automatic differentiation tools are used for other processes such as clouds, aerosols, diffusion, and advection. The continuous adjoint of advection is developed manually. For adjoint validation, the brute-force or finite-difference method (FDM) is implemented process by process with box- or column-model simulations. Due to the inherent limitations of the FDM caused by numerical round-off errors, the complex variable method (CVM) is adopted where necessary. The adjoint model often shows better agreement with the CVM than with the FDM. The adjoints of all science processes compare favorably with the FDM and CVM. In an example application of the full multiphase adjoint model, we provide the first estimates of how emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) affect public health across the US.

-            "description": "Urban ozone (O3) formation can be limited by NOx, VOCs, or both, complicating the design of effective O3 abatement plans. A satellite-retrieved ratio of formaldehyde to NO2 (HCHO/NO2), developed from theory and modeling, has previously been used to indicate O3 formation chemistry. Here, we connect this space-based indicator to spatiotemporal variations in O3 recorded by on-the-ground monitors over major U.S. cities. High-O3 events vary nonlinearly with OMI HCHO and NO2, and the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 formation regimes occurs at higher HCHO/NO2 value (3 to 4) than previously determined from models, with slight intercity variations. To extend satellite records back to 1996, we develop an approach to harmonize observations from GOME and SCIAMACHY that accounts for differences in spatial resolution and overpass time. Two-decade (1996-2016) multisatellite HCHO/NO2 captures the timing and location of the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 production regimes in major U.S. cities, which aligns with the observed long-term changes in urban-rural gradient of O3 and the reversal of O3 weekend effect. Our findings suggest promise for applying space-based HCHO/NO2 to interpret local O3 chemistry, particularly with the new-generation satellite instruments that offer finer spatial and temporal resolution.

A satellite-retrieved ratio of formaldehyde to NO2 (HCHO/NO2), developed from theory and modeling, has previously been used to indicate O3 formation chemistry. Here, we connect this space-based indicator to spatiotemporal variations in O3 recorded by on-the-ground monitors over major U.S. cities. High-O3 events vary nonlinearly with OMI HCHO and NO2, and the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 formation regimes occurs at higher HCHO/NO2 value (3 to 4) than previously determined from models, with slight intercity variations. To extend satellite records back to 1996, we develop an approach to harmonize observations from GOME and SCIAMACHY that accounts for differences in spatial resolution and overpass time. Two-decade (1996-2016) multisatellite HCHO/NO2 captures the timing and location of the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 production regimes in major U.S. cities, which aligns with the observed long-term changes in urban-rural gradient of O3 and the reversal of O3 weekend effect. Our findings suggest promise for applying space-based HCHO/NO2 to interpret local O3 chemistry, particularly with the new-generation satellite instruments that offer finer spatial and temporal resolution.

-            "description": "A series of chamber experiments was conducted to investigate the change in the relative contribution of multigeneration reaction products to total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass across a range of parent n-alkanes (C10-C17) that has a high potential for SOA formation in urban atmospheres. Contributions of select first, second, and higher generation products to SOA was investigated using online speciation by an aerosol mass spectrometer and varied substantially across the range of investigated alkanes. As expected, the presence of first-generation species in SOA is limited primarily by volatility with small contributions at the low end of the investigated n-alkane range and increasing gradually as the number of carbons is increased. The formation of lower volatility second and higher generation nitrate-containing species, in contrast, appears to be mechanistically limited leading to lower average contributions of organic nitrates to OA as the size of the parent n-alkane is increased. The impact of increased water vapor concentrations similarly varied with the size of the parent alkane with diminished effect as both alkane carbon number and generation number increased. The largest impacts of water, however, were between dry (~3%) and slightly humid (~14%) with little change observed at higher relative humidities. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nDocherty, K.S., W.

Contributions of select first, second, and higher generation products to SOA was investigated using online speciation by an aerosol mass spectrometer and varied substantially across the range of investigated alkanes. As expected, the presence of first-generation species in SOA is limited primarily by volatility with small contributions at the low end of the investigated n-alkane range and increasing gradually as the number of carbons is increased. The formation of lower volatility second and higher generation nitrate-containing species, in contrast, appears to be mechanistically limited leading to lower average contributions of organic nitrates to OA as the size of the parent n-alkane is increased. The impact of increased water vapor concentrations similarly varied with the size of the parent alkane with diminished effect as both alkane carbon number and generation number increased. The largest impacts of water, however, were between dry (~3%) and slightly humid (~14%) with little change observed at higher relative humidities. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nDocherty, K.S., W. Preston, R. Yaga, M. Jaoui, T. Riedel, J. Offenberg, T. Kleindienst, and M. Lewandowski.

Neonicotinoid-treated seeds could be available to wildlife through spillage or exposed seeds near or at the soil surface due to incomplete or shallow drilling. We quantified seed spills that may occur during loading or refilling the hopper at a landscape-scale using road-based surveys. We also quantified undrilled seeds in 1-m2 frames on the soil in the center and corner of fields to obtain estimates at the field scale. We broadcast seeds on the soil surface of a tilled field and left them for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30 days to quantify neonicotinoid decrease under field conditions. Lastly, we documented wildlife at neonicotinoid-treated seed spills with trail cameras. We estimated the number of spills during planting to be 3,496 (95%CI: 1,855\u20135,138) and 2,609 (95%CI: 862\u20134,357) for corn, 11,009 (95%CI: 6,950\u201315,067) and 21,105 (95%CI: 6,162\u201336,048) for soybean, and 830 (95%CI: 160\u20131,500) and 791 (95%CI: 0\u20131,781) for wheat in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Exposed seeds were present at the soil surface in 35% of 71 fields. The probability that seeds were present on the soil surface was higher for soybeans (18.8 and 49.4% in the center and corners, respectively) than for corn (1.6 and 2.7%, respectively), and seed densities were also higher (1.04 vs 0.07 seeds/m2, respectively). Neonicotinoids decreased rapidly on seeds on the soil surface but persisted as long as 30 days. Over a dozen species of birds and mammals consumed seeds at simulated spills, with an average time for birds to find spills of 1.3 \u00b1 1.5 days and an average time to consumption of 4.1 \u00b1 3.4 days. Seeds are abundant on the soil surface for wildlife to consume during the spring planting season and should be considered in pesticide risk assessments.

In vitro biotransformation of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pyrene (PYR) and benzo[a]pyrene (BAP), and two organic sunscreen agents, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OCT), was measured using S9 fractions isolated from liver tissue and tissues of the upper GIT in rainbow trout.  For PYR, BAP, and EHMC, activity was substantially higher in liver S9 fractions than in GIT S9 fractions.  For OCT, activity was highest in GIT S9 fractions.  An existing in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) model for fish, which yields a whole-animal biotransformation rate constant (kMET), was expanded to consider biotransformation in the GIT.  The kMET values obtained using measured rates of in vitro activity (liver and GIT) were in good agreement with kMET values measured in controlled in vivo experiments, providing strong support for the IVIVE approach.  Moreover, inclusion of GIT activity into the model prediction for OCT resulted in much better agreement with the empirical kMET estimate than was obtained using a \u2018liver only\u2019 model.  These findings suggest that current \u2018liver only\u2019 approaches to IVIVE modeling may underestimate in vivo whole-animal biotransformation rates for chemicals that undergo substantial biotransformation in the GIT.  Thus, failure to consider biotransformation in the GIT may lead to overestimation of true levels of bioaccumulation. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSaunders, L., P.

Moreover, inclusion of GIT activity into the model prediction for OCT resulted in much better agreement with the empirical kMET estimate than was obtained using a \u2018liver only\u2019 model.  These findings suggest that current \u2018liver only\u2019 approaches to IVIVE modeling may underestimate in vivo whole-animal biotransformation rates for chemicals that undergo substantial biotransformation in the GIT.  Thus, failure to consider biotransformation in the GIT may lead to overestimation of true levels of bioaccumulation. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSaunders, L., P.

As a result, surrounding human communities receive lower overall ecosystem services from the remaining forests, which have been valued among the highest in the world and include fisheries habitat support, shoreline protection and stabilization from natural disasters, and water filtration. Although urban mangrove forests have been characterized as distinct in composition and structure in comparison with their non-urban counterparts, previous studies lack quantified representations of urbanness as well as any inclusion of hydrology or water chemistry, which are important influences on mangrove forest structure, composition, and function. This study uses ground-based and LiDAR measurements of mangroves across urban gradients in Puerto Rico to characterize forest composition and structure. It then tests for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed variability in forest structure and composition. This data set includes all data and R scripts used in the analysis of Puerto Rico's urban mangroves. Data sets include individual tree species identification and diameter measurements as well as biomass. It also includes summary statistics from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) measurements flown by NASA's GLiHT program.

The results of this study will be useful to improving our ability to predict in vivo developmental toxicants based on in vitro data and in silico models. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nZurlinden, T., K.

The current study determines infiltration rates in six tree boxes and analyzes the effects of season, age of the tree box, and depth on infiltration.  Our study site is in Louisville, KY, where Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) teamed with U.S. EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development, URS Corporation, and the Center for Infrastructure Research at the University of Louisville (U of L) to monitor the performance of six tree boxes and other stormwater control measures (SCMs) and to evaluate the effectiveness of groups of controls.  Each tree box is 1.5 m wide, 1.5 m long, and 1.8 m deep.  Street and parking lot runoff enters each tree box though a curb cut. Time domain reflectometers (TDRs) were embedded in the tree box media to continuously monitor volumetric soil moisture content and other parameters. TDRs were installed at 0.30 m (designated as TDR2), 0.60 m (designated as TDR3), and 1.50 m (designated as TDR4) below the soil surface of the tree box media. The moisture content recorded by the TDRs was used to calculate infiltration rates through the media using the Green-Ampt equation. Infiltration rates through the 0.30 m soil section between TDR2 and TDR3 (termed as upper section), through the 0.90 m soil section between TDR3 and TDR4 (termed as bottom section), and the infiltration rate through 1.20 m soil section between TDR2 and TDR4 (termed as combined section) were calculated. For each rain event, two infiltration rates were calculated.  The first determined the initial infiltration rate based on infiltrating water and the second calculated the saturated infiltration rate based on draining water. Initial and saturated infiltration rates varied among all six tree boxes. For four of the six tree boxes, the initial infiltration rate did not vary with depth. However, the saturated infiltration rate varied with depth for five of the six tree boxes.  Overall, the saturated infiltration rate of the combined section is 1.7 times larger than the upper section. Studies from other researchers reported 8 and 100 times variation of surface infiltration rate within 2 m and 5 m spatial distance respectively, 1.7 times variation between upper and combined sections should be considered a non-meaningful difference. In the second year, the initial infiltration rate and saturated infiltration rate decreased by 20% and 38% respectively, from the first year. The infiltration rate varies with seasons. In the growing season, it is 80% larger than in the non-growing season. The smallest infiltration rates were observed during winter and largest infiltration rates were observed in summer.

-            "description": "This dataset provides the values used to develop the figures within the manuscript \"Incorporating upstream emissions into electric sector nitrogen oxide reduction targets\". \n\nHere is the abstract from that manuscript: Electricity production is a major source of air pollutants in the U.S. Policies to reduce these emissions can result in the power industry choosing to apply controls or switch to fuels with lower combustion emissions. However, the life cycle emissions associated with various fuels can differ considerably, potentially impacting the effectiveness of fuel switching. Life cycle emissions, which include emissions from extracting, processing, transporting, and distributing fuels, as well as manufacturing and constructing new generating capacity, have received less consideration in policy-making. Life cycle analysis allows quantification of these emissions such that they can be considered in decision-making. We examine a hypothetical electric sector emission reduction target for nitrogen oxides using the Global Change Assessment Model with U.S. state-level resolution. When only power plant emissions are considered in setting an emission reduction target, fuel switching leads to an increase in upstream emissions that offsets a portion of the targeted reductions.

However, the life cycle emissions associated with various fuels can differ considerably, potentially impacting the effectiveness of fuel switching. Life cycle emissions, which include emissions from extracting, processing, transporting, and distributing fuels, as well as manufacturing and constructing new generating capacity, have received less consideration in policy-making. Life cycle analysis allows quantification of these emissions such that they can be considered in decision-making. We examine a hypothetical electric sector emission reduction target for nitrogen oxides using the Global Change Assessment Model with U.S. state-level resolution. When only power plant emissions are considered in setting an emission reduction target, fuel switching leads to an increase in upstream emissions that offsets a portion of the targeted reductions. When fuel extraction, processing, and transport emissions are included under the reduction target, the resulting control strategy meets the required reductions and does so at lower cost. However, manufacturing and construction emissions increase, indicating that it may be beneficial to consider these sources as well. In the real world, life cycle-based approaches could be implemented by allowing industry to earn reduction credits by reducing upstream emissions. We discuss some of the limitations of such an approach, including the difficulty in identifying the location of upstream emissions, which may occur across regulatory authorities or even outside of the U.S. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBabaee, S., D.

The objective of this study was to investigate the use of pyrolysis as a possible technique to recover valuable materials and energy from different components of e-waste as an alternative approach for limiting their disposal to landfills. The study includes investigating the potential impact of thermal processing of e-waste.Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) of e-waste components were used to better understand the mass loss characteristics of the pyrolysis process up to 700 oC. The changes in e-waste chemical components during pyrolysis were considered using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques. The energy recovery from pyrolysis was made in a horizontal tube furnace under anoxic and isothermal condition of selected temperatures of 300, 400 and 500 oC. Critical and valuable metals were recovered from electronic components. Pyrolysis produced liquid and gas mixtures organic compounds that can be used as fuels, but the process also emitted particulate matter and semi-volatile organic products, and the remaining ash contained leachable pollutants.  Furthermore, toxicity leaching characteristic profile of e-waste and partly oxidized products were conducted to measure the levels of pollutants leached before and after pyrolysis at selected temperatures. The results of this study contribute to the development of alternative approaches to practical recycling that could especially help reduce plastic pollution and recover materials of value from e-waste.

Here, TTC values derived using oral (sub)chronic No Observable (Adverse) Effect Level (NO(A)EL) data from the EPA\u2019s Toxicity Values database (ToxValDB) were compared with published TTC values from Munro et al.

Chemicals were assigned into the five TTC classes (Cramer structural class I, II, III, containing alerts for genotoxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). 114 (2.5%) chemicals were determined to be not appropriate for TTC. The TTC values derived from the ToxValDB were similar, but not identical to the Munro TTC values: Cramer I (37.3 compared to 30 ug/kg-day), Cramer II (34.6 compared to 9 ug/kg-day) and Cramer III (3.9 compared to 1.5 ug/kg-day). The 5th percentile values of Cramer classes I and II for the ToxValDB and Munro datasets were not statistically different whereas the class III 5th percentile values were different. Chemical features of the two class III datasets were evaluated to account for the differences in TTC values. The revised Kroes workflow was then applied to a large set of chemicals (~45,000).

Understanding the impact of varying degrees of electric vehicle adoption and CO2 intensities on emission reduction in the city is critical. Here, using a technology-rich, bottom-up, energy system optimization model, we analyze cost and air emission impacts of New York City\u2019s proposed CO2 reduction policies for the transportation sector through a scenario framework. Our analysis reveals electrification of light-duty vehicles at earlier periods are essential for deeper reductions in air emissions. When further combined with energy efficiency improvements, these actions contribute to CO2 reductions under the scenarios of higher CO2 intense electricity. Significant reliance on fossil fuels and a need for structural change pose challenges to cost-effective CO2 reductions in the transportation sector. Here we found that uncertainties associated with decarbonization of the electric grid has minimum influence on cost-effectiveness of CO2 reduction pathways for transportation sector. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nIsik, M., R.
