Therefore, to increase efficiencies in chemical risk assessment, scientists and risk assessors are turning to mechanistic-based studies, making greater use of in vitro and in silico methods, to evaluate potential environmental and human health hazards.  A framework that has gained traction for capturing available knowledge describing the linkage between mechanistic data and the apical toxicity endpoints, required for regulatory assessments, is the adverse outcome pathway (AOP).  A number of international activities have focused on AOP development and plausible applications to regulatory decision-making.  These interactions have prompted dialog between research scientists and regulatory communities to consider how best to use the AOP framework in risk assessment.  While expert-facilitated discussions have been instrumental in moving the science of AOPs forward, it was recognized that a survey of the broader scientific community would aid in identifying current limitations while guiding future initiatives for the AOP framework.  To that end, a global \u2018Horizon Scanning\u2019 exercise was conducted to solicit questions concerning the challenges or limitations that must be addressed to realize the full potential of the AOP framework in research and regulatory decision making.  The majority of questions received fell into several broad topical areas including the concepts of AOP networks and quantitative AOPs, collaboration on and communication of AOP knowledge, AOP discovery and development, chemical and cross-species extrapolation, exposure considerations, and AOP applications.  An expert ranking exercise was then conducted to identify the most important questions for each category.  These questions were used to develop four broad themes to inform and guide future AOP research and regulatory initiatives.  In addition, frequently asked questions (FAQs) were identified and addressed by experts in the field.  Answers to FAQs will aid in framing further discussions about common misperceptions about AOPs and allow for clarification of AOP topics.  The need for clarification occurred with surprising frequency, indicating that improvements are needed in communicating the AOP framework among the scientific and regulatory communities.  Overall, the \u2018Horizon Scanning\u2019 effort brought together the global scientific community to guide the direction of future initiatives and identify key questions surrounding the AOP framework.

Corroded iron and cement-mortar lined iron represented the infrastructure surfaces, and were conditioned in a 23 m long, 15 cm diameter (75 ft long, 6 in diameter) pilot-scale drinking water distribution pipe system.  Decontamination was evaluated using increased water velocity (flushing) alone at 0.5 m sec-1 (1.7 ft sec-1), as well as free chlorine (5 and 25 mg L-1), monochloramine (25 mg L-1), chlorine dioxide (5 and 25 mg L-1), ozone (2.0 mg L-1), peracetic acid 25 mg L-1) and acidified nitrite (0.1 mol L-1 at pH 2 and 3), all followed by flushing at 0.3 m sec-1 (1 ft sec-1).  Flushing alone reduced the adhered spores by 0.5 and 2.0 log10 from iron and cement-mortar, respectively.   Log10 reduction on corroded iron pipe wall coupons ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 at respective chlorine dioxide concentrations of 5 and 25 mg L-1, although spores were undetectable on the iron surface during disinfection at 25 mg L-1.  Acidified nitrite (pH 2, 0.1 mol L-1) yielded no detectable spores on the iron surface during the flushing phase after disinfection. Chlorine dioxide was the best performing disinfectant with >3.0 log10 removal from cement-mortar at 5 and 25 mg L-1.The data show that free chlorine, monochloramine, ozone and chlorine dioxide followed by flushing can reduce adhered spores by >3.0 log10 on cement-mortar. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSzabo , J., G.

-            "description": "Ongoing honey bee colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating many high nutrient crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts.  Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure; however, the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate target pest insects. However, mounting evidence indicates that these neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera), via impairments on learning and memory, and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally, clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site, the nAChR, and colony level consequences. Development of AOPs has led to the identification of research gaps which, for example, may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions, causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed, laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the putative AOP network assembly, which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies, are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses.

Experiments were designed to produce flames with practically relevant stoichiometric ratios (SR=1.2-1.4) and constant residence times (2.3s).  Size-classified fly ash samples were collected, and measurements focused on the soot, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) composition of the total and ultrafine (<0.6\u00b5m) fly ash.  Results indicate that although the total fly ash carbon, as measured by loss on ignition, was always acceptably low (<2%) with all three oxy-combustion conditions lower than air-combustion, the ultrafine fly ash for both air-fired and oxy-fired combustion conditions consists primarily of carbonaceous material (50-95%).  Carbonaceous components on particles <0.6\u00b5m measured by a thermal optical method showed that large fractions (52-93%) consisted of OC rather than EC, as expected.  This observation was supported by thermogravimetric analysis indicating that for the air, 28% oxy, and 32% oxy conditions, 14-71% of this material may be OC volatilizing between 100 and 550\u00b0C with the remaining 29-86% being EC/soot.  However, for the 36% oxy condition, OC may comprise over 90% of the ultrafine carbon with a much smaller EC/soot contribution.  These data were interpreted by considering the effects of oxy-combustion on flame attachment, ignition delay, and soot oxidation of a bituminous coal, and the effects of these processes on OC and EC emissions.  Flame aerodynamics and inlet oxidant composition may influence emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from a bituminous coal.   During oxy-coal combustion, judicious control of inlet oxygen concentration and placement may be used to minimize organic HAP and soot emissions. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nAndersen, M., N.

Despite, the wealth of toxicological data for this organism, until recently genome scale information was lacking for the species, which limited the utility of the species for pathway-based toxicity testing and research. As part of a EPA Pathfinder Innovation Project, next generation sequencing was applied to generate a draft genome assembly, which was published in 2016. However, application of those genome-scale sequencing resources was still limited by the lack of available gene annotations for fathead minnow. Here we report on development of a first generation genome annotation for fathead minnow and the dissemination of that information through a web-based browser that makes it easy to search for genes of interest, extract the corresponding sequence, identify intron and exon boundaries and regulatory regions, and align the computationally predicted genes with other supporting evidence. This work greatly enhances the utility of the genome assemblies that were developed and makes it accessible to the ecotoxicology community world-wide, opening up a wide array of new research opportunities with the species. The URL associated with this data set provides access to the genome browser that was developed as well as the current gene models and evidence tracks. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSaari, T., A.

The present study was designed to compare uptake of 5 current-use pesticides (imidacloprid, atrazine, triadimefon, fipronil, and pendimethalin) in American toads (Bufo americanus) from exposure on soils with significant organic matter content differences (14.1%\u2009=\u2009high organic matter and 3.1%\u2009=\u2009low organic matter). We placed toads on high- or low-organic matter soil after applying individual current-use pesticides on the soil surface for an 8-h exposure duration. Whole body tissue homogenates and soils were extracted and analyzed using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry to determine pesticide tissue and soil concentration, as well as bioconcentration factor in toads. Tissue concentrations were greater on the low-organic matter soil than the high-organic matter soil across all pesticides (average\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error; 1.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009ppm and 0.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23\u2009ppm, respectively), and bioconcentration was significantly higher for toads on the low-organic matter soil (analysis of covariance p\u2009=\u20090.002). Soil organic matter is known to play a significant role in the mobility of pesticides and bioavailability to living organisms. Agricultural soils typically have relatively lower organic matter content and serve as a functional habitat for amphibians. The potential for pesticide accumulation in amphibians moving throughout agricultural landscapes may be greater and should be considered in conservation and policy efforts.

It can be accessed through the following means: Raw files are analyzed using scripts written in R-programming language and outputs from R included the graphs used in the publication. Summaries of the data, R-scripts and summary outputs from the R-analysis are located at the following locations: L:\\Lab\\NHEERL_MEA\\Crooks\\MEA_MetalOxides\r\n          This directory and its sub-directory contains over 30 output files from the R-script analysis including xcell files summarizing the parameters of different statistical models and visualizations of the data in the form of tiff files.\r\nL:\\Lab\\NHEERL_MEA\\nanoparticles\\Crooks MEA\\final analysis\r\n     This directory and its sub-directories include R-scripts used for analysis as well as folders with R-outputs summarizing statistics for different Fixed-dose trend, fixed interaction and fixed square root models used for analysis. There are over 50 files in this directory. Format: Raw data are derived from Axion Biosystems Maestro system using Axis 1.9 or later software. Data are saved as \"*.raw\" in a proprietary format on DROBO devices in the Shafer lab. The DROBO devices consist of five 2TB or larger hard drives and allows for self backing of files. Files are stored in folders based on the date the cell culture used for a particular experiment was made, and in subfolders for each experiment date for that culture. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nStrickland, J., W.

Modeled PM2.5 predictions at finer resolution\nmay more accurately predict residential exposure; however few studies have compared results across\ndifferent exposure assessment methods.\nMethods: We utilized a cohort of 5679 patients who had undergone a cardiac catheterization between\n2002\u20132009 and resided in NC. Exposure to PM2.5 for the year prior to catheterization was estimated using data\nfrom air quality monitors (AQS), Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) fused models at the census tract and\n12 km spatial resolutions, and satellite-based models at 10 km and 1 km resolutions. Case status was either a\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) index>23 or a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Logistic regression was used to\nmodel odds of having CAD or an MI with each 1-unit (\u03bcg/m3) increase in PM2.5, adjusting for sex, race, smoking\nstatus, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural status.\nResults: We found that the elevated odds for CAD>23 and MI were nearly equivalent for all exposure assessment\nmethods. One difference was that data from AQS and the census tract CMAQ showed a rural/urban difference\nin relative risk, which was not apparent with the satellite or 12 km-CMAQ models.\nConclusions: Long-term air pollution exposure was associated with coronary artery disease for both modeled and\nmonitored data.

The method uses a number of quality controls to increase data quality and to reduce interlaboratory and intralaboratory variation. The method has been evaluated by examining virus recovery from ground and reagent grade waters seeded with poliovirus type 3 and murine norovirus as a surrogate for human noroviruses.

The main model matrices are in green, A, B, and C; the result matrices are in gold, D, L, LCI, and U. Aggregate data quality scores are presented for B, D and U matrices in peach. Data quality scores use the US EPA data quality asssessment system, see US EPA 2016.

Chemicals of concern are assumed to be released from point sources (e.g., wastewater treatment works) and have log n-octanol/water partition coefficients (log Kow) ranging from 3 to 14. The rivers of concern have mean annual discharges ranging from 1.09 to 3240 m3/s. Five existing USEPA models are used to generate the required databases. The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) and the High Throughput Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model (SHEDS-HT) are used to estimate the pchem properties and loading rates of the chemicals of interest, respectively. Using these data, the dissolved and total water concentrations, and total sediment concentrations for each chemical-loading combination in the rivers of interest are simulated using the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS). Lastly, the Kow-based Aquatic BioAccumulation Model (KABAM) and the Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator (BASS) are used to estimate BCFs of periphyton and phytoplankton and BAFs of benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish in the rivers of interest. Using these BCFs and BAFs and EXAMS dissolved water concentrations, expected whole-body concentrations of exposed fish and invertebrates are calculated for each chemical-loading-river combination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBarber, C., K.

Using these BCFs and BAFs and EXAMS dissolved water concentrations, expected whole-body concentrations of exposed fish and invertebrates are calculated for each chemical-loading-river combination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBarber, C., K. Isaacs, and C. Stevens. Developing and applying metamodels of high resolution process-based simulations for high throughput exposure assessment of organic chemicals in riverine ecosystems.

Inactivation by the LEDs was compared with the efficacy of conventional UV sources, the low-pressure (LP) and medium-pressure (MP) mercury vapor lamps. The work also calculated the electrical energy per order of reduction of the microorganisms by the five UV sources.For E. coli, all five UV sources yielded similar inactivation rates.

When considering electrical energy per order of reduction, the LP UV lamp was the most efficient for E. coli and MS2, and the MPUV and LPUV were equally efficient for HAdV2 and B. pumilus spores. Among the UVC LEDs, the 280 nm LED unit required the least energy per log reduction of E. coli and HAdV2. The 280 nm and 260|280 nm LED units were equally efficient per log reduction of B. pumilus spores, and the 260 nm LED unit required the lowest energy per order of reduction of MS2 coliphage.

Above-ground forest biomass was estimated at a 15 m spatial resolution implementing methodology first posited by the Woods Hole Research Center where they developed the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD2000) \u2500 an above-ground forest biomass map (30 m) for the conterminous United States. For EPA\u2019s effort, spatial predictor layers for AGB estimation included derived products from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD) cover type and tree canopy density data, the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) forest type classification data, USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) topographic data, and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA\u2019s) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) tree height data. These predictor variables and Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) response variables (observed canopy height and AGB) were related through multivariate tree-based regression models. Units for this AGB map are in Mg/ha for each 15m pixel. Mean biomass (forest only) for the 15 m pixels was 72.59 Mg/ha (\u03c3 = 26.83).

Non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of the ocean-atmosphere system make the identification of the teleconnection signals difficult to be detected at a local scale as it could cause large uncertainties when using linear correlation analysis only. This paper explores the relationship between global SST and terrestrial precipitation with respect to long-term non-stationary teleconnection signals during 1981-2010 over three regions in North America and one in Central America. Empirical mode decomposition as well as wavelet analysis is utilized to extract the intrinsic trend and the dominant oscillation of the SST and precipitation time series in sequence.  After finding possible associations between the dominant oscillation of seasonal precipitation and global SST through lagged correlation analysis, the statistically significant SST regions are extracted based on the correlation coefficient. With these characterized associations, individual contribution of these SST forcing regions linked to the related precipitation responses are further quantified through nonlinear modeling with the aid of extreme learning machine. Results indicate that the non-leading SST regions also contribute a salient portion to the terrestrial precipitation variability compared to some known leading SST regions. In some cases, these estimated contributions reveals some clues of the coupling interactions between oceanic and atmospheric processes. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nChang, N., S.

The response to change in temperature is well predicted through a feedforward Artificial Neural Network. The most parsimonious model, as indicated by Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion, Corrected (AIC,C), utilizes 11 input variables, a single hidden layer of 4 tanh activation function nodes, and a single linear output function. This model predicts thermal behavior of single precursor aerosols to less than \u00b1 5%, which is within the measurement uncertainty, while limiting the problem of overfitting. Prediction of thermal behavior of SOA can be achieved by a concise number of descriptors of the precursor hydrocarbon including the number of internal and external double bonds, number of methyl- and ethyl- functional groups, molecular weight, number of ring structures, in addition to the volume of SOA formed, and an indicator of which of four oxidant precursors was used to initiate reactions (NOx photo-oxidation, photolysis of H2O2, ozonolysis, or thermal decomposition of N2O5). Additional input variables, such as, chamber volumetric residence time, relative humidity, initial concentration of oxides of nitrogen, reacted hydrocarbon concentration, and further descriptors of the precursor hydrocarbon, including carbon number, number of oxygen atoms, and number of aromatic ring structures, lead to over fit models, and are unnecessary for an efficient, accurate predictive model of thermal behavior of SOA.

The method used here involves integrated sampling that is designed to allow for detailed and specific chemical analysis of particulate matter (PM) in the Bakersfield airshed. To achieve this objective, filter samples were taken during thirty-four 23-hr periods between 19 May and 26 June 2010 and analyzed for organic tracers by gas chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Contributions to organic carbon (OC) were determined by two organic tracer-based techniques:  primary OC by chemical mass balance and secondary OC by a mass fraction method. Radiocarbon (14C) measurements of the total organic carbon were also made to determine the split between the modern and fossil carbon and thereby constrain unknown sources of OC not accounted for by either tracer-based attribution technique. \r\nFrom the analysis, OC contributions from four primary sources and four secondary sources were determined, which comprised three sources of modern carbon and five sources of fossil carbon. The major primary sources of OC were from vegetative detritus (9.8%), diesel (2.3%), gasoline (<1.0%), and lubricating oil impacted motor vehicle exhaust (30%); measured secondary sources resulted from isoprene (1.5%), \u03b1-pinene (<1.0%), toluene (<1.0%), and naphthalene (<1.0%, as an upper limit) contributions. The average observed organic carbon (OC) was 6.42  \u00b1 2.33 \u03bcgC m-3. The 14C derived apportionment indicated that modern and fossil components were nearly equivalent on average; however, the fossil contribution ranged from 32-66% over the five week campaign. With the fossil primary and secondary sources aggregated, only 25% of the fossil organic carbon could not be attributed. Whereas, nearly 80% of the modern carbon could not be attributed to primary and secondary sources accessible to this analysis, which included tracers of biomass burning, vegetative detritus and secondary biogenic carbon.

Urban trees are removed due to hazard prevention or aesthetic preferences.  Previous research attributed tree\nloss to decreases in canopy cover.  However, this provides little information about location and structural characteristics of trees lost, as well as environmental and social factors affecting tree loss dynamics.  This is particularly relevant in residential landscapes where access to residential parcels for field surveys is limited.  We tested whether multi-temporal airborne LiDAR and multi-spectral imagery collected at a 5-year interval can be used to investigate urban tree loss dynamics across residential landscapes in Denver, CO and Milwaukee, WI, covering 400,705 residential parcels in 444 census tracts.  Position and stem height of trees lost were extracted from canopy height models calculated as the difference between final (year 5) and initial (year 0) vegetation height derived from LiDAR.  Multivariate regression models were used to predict number and height of tree stems lost in residential parcels in each census tract based on urban morphological and socio-economic variables.  A total of 28,427 stems were lost from residential parcels in Denver and Milwaukee over 5 years.  Overall, 7% of residential parcels lost one stem, averaging 90.87 stems per km2.  Average stem height was 10.16 m, though trees lost in Denver were taller compared to Milwaukee.  The number of stems lost was higher in neighborhoods with higher canopy cover and developed before the 1970s.  However, socio-economic characteristics had little effect on tree loss dynamics.

Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, Vibrio, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of ~5 ppm) can induce a significant Vibrio growth response (68\u20131,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of Vibrio in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLydon, K.A., D. Glinski, J. Westrich, M. Henderson, and E. Lipp. Effects of triclosan on bacterial community composition and Vibrio populations in natural seawater microcosms.

Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, Vibrio, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of ~5 ppm) can induce a significant Vibrio growth response (68\u20131,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of Vibrio in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLydon, K.A., D. Glinski, J. Westrich, M. Henderson, and E. Lipp. Effects of triclosan on bacterial community composition and Vibrio populations in natural seawater microcosms.

Fathead minnows were deployed in cages for 2, 4, or 8 days at three locations near two different waste water treatment plant discharge sites in the Saint Louis Bay, Duluth, MN and one upstream control site. The biological impact of 51 chemicals detected in the surface water was determined using biochemical endpoints, exposure activity ratios for biological and estrogenic responses; known chemical:gene interactions from biological pathways and knowledge bases, and analysis of the co-variance of ovary gene expression with surface water chemistry. Thirty-two chemicals were significantly linked by co-variance with expressed genes. No estrogenic impact on biochemical endpoints was observed in male or female minnows. However, bisphenol A was identified by chemical:gene co-variation as the most impactful chemical across the exposure sites. This was consistent with identification of estrogenic effects on gene expression, high exposure activity ratios across all test sites, and historical analysis of the area.

To this end, the traffic management centers identify the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set that enables the maximum improvement of the traffic safety and mobility performance, and broadcast the optimal parameter set wirelessly to individual ADAS-equipped vehicles. After adopting the optimal parameter set, the ADAS-equipped drivers become active agents in the traffic stream that work collectively and consistently to prevent traffic conflicts, lower the intensity of traffic disturbances, and suppress the development of traffic oscillations into heavy traffic jams. Successful implementation of this objective requires the analysis capability of capturing the impact of the ADAS on driving behaviors, and measuring traffic safety and mobility performance under the influence of the ADAS. To address this challenge, this research proposes a synthetic methodology that incorporates the ADAS-affected driving behavior modeling and state-of-the-art microscopic traffic flow modeling into a virtually simulated environment. Building on such an environment, the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set is identified through an optimization programming framework to enable the maximum safety and mobility improvement. The developed methodology is tested at a freeway facility under both low and high ADAS market penetration rate scenarios. The identified optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set can be used to establish multiple traffic management strategies. These strategies form a pool of candidate plans for the traffic management team to select when they face different control objectives (e.g., safety improvement more important, mobility improvement more important, or balanced safety and mobility improvement). It is also found that the traffic system optimization becomes easier to achieve as the ADAS penetration rate becomes higher. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLiu, H., H.

It is also found that the traffic system optimization becomes easier to achieve as the ADAS penetration rate becomes higher. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLiu, H., H.

The degree of mixing affects the spread of contaminants in a water distribution system. Many studies have been conducted on the mixing at the cross junctions. Yet few have focused on double-Tee junctions of unequal pipe sizes. To investigate the solute mixing at double-Tee junctions with unequal pipe sizes, a series of experiments were conducted in a turbulent regime (Re=12500\u201350000) with different Reynolds number ratios and connecting pipe lengths. It is found that dimensionless outlet concentrations depended on mixing mechanism at the impinging interface of pipe junctions. Junction with a larger pipe size ratio is associated with more complete mixing. The inlet Reynolds number ratio affects mixing more strongly than the outlet Reynolds number ratio. Furthermore, the dimensionless connecting pipe length in a double-Tee played an important and complicated role in the flow mixing.

In the present study, a detailed chemical analysis of the organic fraction of gas and particle phases originating from the ozonolysis of a mixture of \u03b1-farnesene and \u03b2-farnesene was carried out in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber. More than 80 organic compounds bearing OH functionality were detected for the first time in this system in the gas and particle phases. The major secondary organic aerosol (SOA) components included conjugated \u03b1 farnesene trienols, hydroxyl carboxylic acid and its corresponding lactones, C3\u2013C7 linear dicarboxylic acids, and hydroxy/carbonyl/carboxylic compounds. Of particular importance was 5,6-dihydroxy-6-methylheptan-2-one (DHMHO), which was detected at high concentration. In the gas phase, the main species identified were trienols and their corresponding epoxides and diepoxides. Proposed reaction schemes are provided for selected compounds. A similar analysis was performed for ambient PM2.5 samples collected during summer 2013 as part of the SOAS to determine farnesene contributions to PM2.5. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analysis were consistent with the occurrence of several farnesene SOA compounds, indicating the potential impact of farnesene on the regional aerosol burden. The high abundance of DHMHO in chamber SOA and its presence in ambient PM2.5 is particularly important because to our knowledge it is specific to farnesene and therefore could serve as an indicator for farnesene emitted into ambient aerosol. In the absence of authentic standards, however, it is difficult to accurately quantify the contribution of SOA originating from farnesene to ambient PM2.5. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nJaoui, M., M.

-            "description": "Under the ExpoCast program, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) researchers have developed a high-throughput (HT) framework for estimating aggregate exposures to chemicals from multiple pathways to support rapid prioritization of chemicals. Here, we present methods to estimate HT exposures to chemicals migrating into food from food contact substances (FCS). These methods consisted of combining an empirical model of chemical migration with estimates of daily population food intakes derived from food diaries from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A linear regression model for migration at equilibrium was developed by fitting available migration measurements as a function of temperature, food type (i.e., fatty, aqueous, acidic, alcoholic), initial chemical concentration in the FCS (C0) and chemical properties. The most predictive variables in the resulting model were C0, molecular weight, log Kow, and food type (R2=0.71, p<0.0001). Migration-based concentrations for 1009 chemicals identified via publicly-available data sources as being present in polymer FCSs were predicted for 12 food groups (combinations of 3 storage temperatures and food type). The model was parameterized with screening-level estimates of C0 based on the functional role of chemical in FCS. By combining these concentrations with daily intakes for food groups derived from NHANES, population ingestion exposures of chemical in mg/kg-bodyweight/day (mg/kg-BW/day) were estimated. Calibrated aggregate exposures were estimated for 1931 chemicals by fitting HT FCS and consumer product exposures to exposures inferred from NHANES biomonitoring (R2=0.61, p<0.001); both FCS and consumer product pathway exposures were significantly predictive of inferred exposures. Including the FCS pathway significantly impacted the ratio of predicted exposures to those estimated to produce steady-state blood concentrations equal to in-vitro bioactive concentrations. While these HT methods have large uncertainties (and thus may not be appropriate for assessments of single chemicals), they can provide critical refinement to aggregate exposure predictions used in risk-based chemical priority\u2013setting. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBiryol, D., C.

To improve our capacity to predict developmental effects from cellular alterations, we built a multi-cellular agent-based model in CompuCell3D that recapitulates the cellular networks and collective cell behavior underlying growth and fusion of the mammalian secondary palate. The model incorporated multiple signaling pathways (TGF?, BMP, FGF, EGF, SHH) in a biological framework to recapitulate morphogenetic events from palatal outgrowth through midline fusion. It effectively simulated higher-level phenotypes (e.g., midline contact, medial edge seam (MES) breakdown, mesenchymal confluence, fusion defects) in response to genetic or environmental perturbations. Perturbation analysis of various control features revealed model functionality with respect to cell signaling systems and feedback loops for growth and fusion, diverse individual cell behaviors and collective cellular behavior leading to physical contact and midline fusion, and quantitative analysis of the TGF/EGF switch that controls MES breakdown \u2013 a key event in morphogenetic fusion. The virtual palate model was then executed with theoretical chemical perturbation scenarios to simulate switch behavior leading to a disruption of fusion following chronic (e.g., dioxin) and acute (e.g., retinoic acid, hydrocortisone) toxicant exposures.

Mapping the geographic distribution of non-native aquatic species is a critically important precursor to understanding the anthropogenic and environmental factors that drive freshwater biological invasions. Such efforts are often limited to local scales and/or to single species, due to the challenges of data acquisition at larger scales. Here we map the distribution of exotic freshwater species richness across the continental United States and investigate the role of human activity in driving macroscale patterns of aquatic invasion. \n\nLocation. The continental United States.\n\nMethods. We assembled maps of non-native aquatic species richness by compiling occurrence data on exotic animal and plant species from publicly accessible databases. Using a dasymetric model of human population density and a spatially explicit model of recreational freshwater fishing demand we analyzed the effect of these metrics of human influence on the degree of invasion at the watershed scale, while controlling for spatial and sampling bias. We also assessed the effects that a temporal mismatch between occurrence data (collected since 1815) and cross-sectional predictors (developed using 2010 data) may have on model fit. \n\nResults. Non-native aquatic species richness exhibits a highly patchy distribution, with hotspots in the Northeast, Great Lakes, Florida, and human population centers on the Pacific coast. These richness patterns are correlated with population density, but are much more strongly predicted by patterns of recreational fishing demand. These relationships are strengthened by temporal matching of datasets and are robust to corrections for sampling effort.\n\nMain Conclusions. Distributions of aquatic invasive species across the continental US are better predicted by freshwater recreational fishing than by human population density. This suggests that observed patterns are driven by a mechanistic link between recreational activity and aquatic invasive species richness, and are not merely the outcome of sampling bias associated with human population density. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nDavis, A., and J.

The workflow first assembles structure-identity pairs using up to four provided chemical identifiers, including chemical name, CASRNs, SMILES, and MolBlock. Problems detected  included errors and mismatches in chemical structure formats, identifiers, and various structure validation issues, including hypervalency and stereochemistry descriptions. Subsequently, a machine learning procedure was applied to evaluate the impact of this curation process. The performance of QSAR models built on only the highest quality subset of the original dataset was compared to the larger curated and corrected data set. The latter showed statistically improved predictive performance. The final workflow was used to curate the full list of PHYSPROP datasets, and is being made publically available for further usage and integration by the scientific community. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMansouri, K., C.

The workflow first assembles structure-identity pairs using up to four provided chemical identifiers, including chemical name, CASRNs, SMILES, and MolBlock. Problems detected  included errors and mismatches in chemical structure formats, identifiers, and various structure validation issues, including hypervalency and stereochemistry descriptions. Subsequently, a machine learning procedure was applied to evaluate the impact of this curation process. The performance of QSAR models built on only the highest quality subset of the original dataset was compared to the larger curated and corrected data set. The latter showed statistically improved predictive performance. The final workflow was used to curate the full list of PHYSPROP datasets, and is being made publically available for further usage and integration by the scientific community. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMansouri, K., C.

The types of information characterizing key events in an AOP can be generated from in silico, in chemico, in vitro or in vivo approaches. Integration of this information and interpretation for decision making are known as integrated approaches to testing and assessment or IATA. One such IATA that has been developed was published by Jaworska et al (2013) which describes a Bayesian network model known as ITS-2. The current work evaluated the performance of ITS-2 using a stratified cross validation approach.  We also characterized the impact of refinements to the network by replacing the most significant component, the output from a commercial expert system TIMES-SS with structural alert information readily generated from the freely available OECD QSAR Toolbox. Lack of any structural alert flags or TIMES-SS predictions, yielded a sensitization potential prediction of 79% +3%/-4%. If the TIMES-SS prediction was replaced by an indicator for the presence of a structural alert, the network predictivity increased to 84% +2%/-4%, which was only slightly less than found for the original network (89% &plusmn;2%). The local applicability domain of the original ITS-2 network was also evaluated using reaction mechanistic domains to better understand what types of chemicals ITS-2 was able to make the best predictions for &ndash; i.e. a local validity domain analysis.

The inputs data contain industry-specific data, market-specific data, and optimization parameters. Data outputs include optimized mitigation options and optimized economic parameters of products. The input data that are specific to the pulp and paper industry characterize the following aspects of individual facilities: unit-level production for each category of products, capacity, production cost (material, operations, and maintenance costs) (RISI 2011), capital cost, fuel types and cost, information about emissions sources (boilers, recovery furnaces, and lime kilns), mitigation technologies (emission controls), energy efficiency measures, and fuel emission intensities. The data related to mitigation technologies provide information regarding applicable air pollution control technologies, their costs, and their emission control characteristics. Similarly, data related to measures intended to increase energy efficiency provide information regarding applicable energy efficiency measures, their costs, and their characteristics. The market data consist of historical and projected nationwide commodity consumption, discount rates, cost of electricity, escalation rates, economic life of technologies, and import and export quantities and prices. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBhander , G., and W.

+            "description": "The pulp & paper sector database contains the entire population of integrated and non-integrated pulp and paper mills (approx. 663 mills) and their products in the U.S. Ion this database, all paper products in the modeling framework are grouped into eight major categories: 1) containerboard, 2) boxboard and other board, 3) packaging and industrial paper, 4) corrugating medium, 5) newsprint, 6) tissue, 7) coated printing and writing paper, and 8) uncoated printing and writing paper. The inputs data contain industry-specific data, market-specific data, and optimization parameters. Data outputs include optimized mitigation options and optimized economic parameters of products. The input data that are specific to the pulp and paper industry characterize the following aspects of individual facilities: unit-level production for each category of products, capacity, production cost (material, operations, and maintenance costs) (RISI 2011), capital cost, fuel types and cost, information about emissions sources (boilers, recovery furnaces, and lime kilns), mitigation technologies (emission controls), energy efficiency measures, and fuel emission intensities. The data related to mitigation technologies provide information regarding applicable air pollution control technologies, their costs, and their emission control characteristics. Similarly, data related to measures intended to increase energy efficiency provide information regarding applicable energy efficiency measures, their costs, and their characteristics. The market data consist of historical and projected nationwide commodity consumption, discount rates, cost of electricity, escalation rates, economic life of technologies, and import and export quantities and prices. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBhander , G., and W. Jozewicz. Universal industrial sectors integrated solutions module\r\nfor the pulp and paper industry.   Nordic Pulp & Paper Research Journal.
