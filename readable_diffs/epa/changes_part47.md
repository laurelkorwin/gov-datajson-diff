             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset describes the block group population and the percentage of the block group population that has potential views of water bodies. A potential view of water is defined as having a body of water that is greater than 300m2 within 50m of a residential location. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home. The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015) map. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, the community level domestic water use is calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). Three reports were used with city- or water supply authority- level domestic water demand data, in addition to county level data. The 2011 Northern Virginia Regional Water Supply Plan provides detailed publicly, privately, and self supplied water use and population served for 2007 and covers most of the Virginia side of the EnviroAtlas study area. The 2011 Fauquier County Regional Water Supply Plan provides detailed publicly, privately, and self supplied water use and population served for 2007 and covers Fauquier County, Virginia. The 2010 Washington Metropolitan Area Water Supply Reliability Study, Part 1 from the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin provides detailed publicly, privately, and self supplied water use and population served for 2008 by water supplier for suppliers drawing from the Potomac River. Data from these reports were weighted across publicly, privately, and self-supplied sources by population served, resulting in a single water use estimate between 25 and 204 GPD for each of the subregions in the study area. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "The Washington DC EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises an area of 5423.43 km2 encompassing the entire area of Washington DC, and portions of the state of Maryland and state of Virginia. These MULC data and maps were derived from 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and infrared light) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as well as ancillary data (e.g., Lidar, National Wetlands Inventory [NWI], cropland, land parcels, power lines, building footprints). Eight land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous, Agriculture, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands. Wetlands were delineated using the state wide wetlands data from National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer updated on October 15, 2018 (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/State-Downloads.html ). An analysis of 600 completely random and 111 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 85.4% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 91.5% within the census block group boundary (see confusion matrices below). These data were developed as part of the Chesapeake Bay High-Resolution Land Cover Project, a cooperative agreement between the Chesapeake Conservancy and the National Park Service, funded through an interagency agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Chesapeake Conservancy, under the direction of Margaret Markham, created the initial statewide 1-meter land cover data. EPA added agriculture and wetlands taken from ancillary data sources. See detailed processing steps and workflow below. This dataset was produced by the Chesapeake Conservancy, the National Park Service, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "description": "The Hydrologically Connected Zone (HCZ) Mask was determined using grid analysis to combine surface water features in the United States from three datasets: First, the surface water features from the 2011 CDL-NLCD. The CDL-NLCD, which was developed by the EnviroAtlas team, is a hybrid of the 2011 CDL produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the 2011 NLCD produced by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium. Features included are 'Open Water' (code 11), 'Woody Wetlands' (code 90) and 'Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands' (code 95). Second, the flowline and waterbody features as represented in the catseed grid from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Plus version 2.1, downloaded June 18, 2013. Third, all areas contiguous to surface water that also have a wetness index value of 550 or greater. The wetness index, also known as the compound topographic index (CTI), is a steady state wetness index. It is commonly used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes. The combination of these three datasets represents the Hydrologically Connected Zone. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas and the Watershed Index Online (WSIO). EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

First, the surface water features were extracted from the 2011 CDL-NLCD. The CDL-NLCD, which was developed by the EnviroAtlas team, is a hybrid of the 2011 CDL produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and the 2011 NLCD produced by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium. Features included are 'Open Water' (code 11), 'Woody Wetlands' (code 90) and 'Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands' (code 95).The second source used was the flowline and waterbody features as represented in the catseed grid from the NHD Plus version 2.1, downloaded June 18, 2013.

This dataset contains the finalized non-transformed variables chosen to represent the Air, Water, Land, Built, and Sociodemographic Domains of the total environment. This does not represent the final variables for the EQI. The Transformed dataset was used to create the EQI. This dataset is for information purposes only for those who want to see the original non-transformed variables.Six criteria air pollutants and 81 hazardous air pollutants are included in this dataset. Data sources are the EPA's Air Quality system (https://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/) and the National-scale Air Toxics Assessment (https://www.epa.gov/nata/). Variables are average pollutant concentrations or emissions for 2000-2005 at the county level for all counties in the United States.

Superfund is a program administered by the EPA to locate, investigate, and clean up the worst hazardous waste sites throughout the United States. Before Superfund, Americans were less aware of how dumping chemical wastes might affect public health and the environment. Hazardous wastes were often left in the open, where they seeped into the ground, flowed into rivers and lakes, and contaminated soil and groundwater. Consequently, where these practices were intensive or continuous, there were uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites. These sites include abandoned warehouses, manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and landfills. Citizen concern about the extent of this problem prompted Congress in 1980 to establish the Superfund Program to eliminate the health and environmental threats posed by hazardous waste sites. EPA administers the Superfund program in cooperation with individual states and tribal governmentsFRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the subset of FRS integrated facilities that link to CERCLIS non-NPL facilities once the CERCLIS data has been integrated into the FRS database. Additional information on FRS is available at the EPA website https://www.epa.gov/enviro/facility-registry-service-frs.",

ICIS tracks NPDES surface water permits issued under the Clean Water Act. Under NPDES, all facilities that discharge pollutants from any point source into waters of the United States are required to obtain a permit. The permit will likely contain limits on what can be discharged, impose monitoring and reporting requirements, and include other provisions to ensure that the discharge does not adversely affect water quality. FRS identifies and geospatially locates facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. Using vigorous verification and data management procedures, FRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the subset of FRS integrated facilities that link to NPDES facilities once the ICIS-NPDES data has been integrated into the FRS database. Additional information on FRS is available at the EPA website https://www.epa.gov/enviro/facility-registry-service-frs.",

When complete, ICIS will provide a database that will contain integrated enforcement and compliance information across most of EPA's programs. The vision for ICIS is to replace EPA's independent databases that contain enforcement data with a single repository for that information. Currently, ICIS contains all Federal Administrative and Judicial enforcement actions and a subset of the Permit Compliance System (PCS), which supports the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). ICIS exchanges non-sensitive enforcement/compliance activities, non-sensitive formal enforcement actions and NPDES information with FRS. This web feature service contains the enforcement/compliance activities and formal enforcement action related facilities; the NPDES facilities are contained in the PCS_NPDES web feature service. FRS identifies and geospatially locates facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. Using vigorous verification and data management procedures, FRS integrates facility data from EPA's national program systems, other federal agencies, and State and tribal master facility records and provides EPA with a centrally managed, single source of comprehensive and authoritative information on facilities. This data set contains the subset of FRS integrated facilities that link to ICIS non-sensitive enforcement/compliance activities and formal enforcement actions once the ICIS data has been integrated into the FRS database.

             "description": "A collection of performance indicators for consistently comparing neighborhoods (census block groups) across the US in regards to their accessibility to jobs or workers via public transit service. Accessibility was modeled by calculating total travel time between block group centroids inclusive of walking to/from transit stops, wait times, and transfers. Block groups that can be accessed in 30 minutes or less from the origin block group are considered accessible. Indicators reflect public transit service in December 2012 and employment/worker counts in 2010. Coverage is limited to census block groups within metropolitan regions served by transit agencies who share their service data in a standardized format called GTFS. All variable names refer to variables in EPA's Smart Location Database. For instance EmpTot10_sum summarizes total employment (EmpTot10) in block groups that are reachable within a 30-minute transit and walking commute. See Smart Location Database User Guide for full variable descriptions.",

(See variable D5b in Smart Location Database Technical Documentation and User Guide (2014) for background) \u2022 Section 405.6(8) - Points for sites located in census block groups with above-average access to employment within a 45-minute drive (See variable D5a in Smart Location Database Technical Documentation and User Guide (2014) for background on methods) \u2022 Section 501.2(4) - Points for lots located in census block groups with above-average neighborhood walkability (See National Walkability Index for background on methods) \u2022 Section 11.501.2(3) - Points for lots located in census block groups with above-average neighborhood walkability (See National Walkability Index for background on methods) Using data available through EPA\u2019s Smart Location Database and National Walkability Index, relative walkability and accessibility to jobs via transit or within a 45-minute drive for census block groups were calculated and ranked into quartile groups. The regional comparison was made by considering the score of each individual census block group as a ratio of the average score of the county in which it is located. Those block groups with scores in the highest two quartiles nationally are eligible for NGBS points per the Sections noted above.

             "description": "A large body of research has demonstrated that land use and urban form can have a significant effect on transportation outcomes. People who live and/or work in compact neighborhoods with a walkable street grid and easy access to public transit, jobs, stores, and services are more likely to have several transportation options to meet their everyday needs. As a result, they can choose to drive less, which reduces their emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants compared to people who live and work in places that are not location efficient. Walking, biking, and taking public transit can also save people money and improve their health by encouraging physical activity.\n\nThe Smart Location Database summarizes several demographic, employment, and built environment variables for every census block group (CBG) in the United States. The database includes indicators of the commonly cited \u201cD\u201d variables shown in the transportation research literature to be related to travel behavior.  The Ds include residential and employment density, land use diversity, design of the built environment, access to destinations, and distance to transit. SLD variables can be used as inputs to travel demand models, baseline data for scenario planning studies, and combined into composite indicators characterizing the relative location efficiency of CBG within U.S. metropolitan regions.\n\nThis update features the most recent geographic boundaries (2019 Census Block Groups) and new and expanded sources of data used to calculate variables. Entirely new variables have been added and the methods used to calculate some of the SLD variables have changed.\n\nMore information on the National Walkability index: https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping\nMore information on the Smart Location Calculator: https://www.slc.gsa.gov/slc/\n",

             "description": "The Walkability Index dataset characterizes every Census 2019 block group in the U.S. based on its relative walkability. Walkability depends upon characteristics of the built environment that influence the likelihood of walking being used as a mode of travel. The Walkability Index is based on the EPA's previous data product, the Smart Location Database (SLD). Block group data from the SLD was the only input into the Walkability Index, and consisted of four variables from the SLD weighted in a formula to create the new Walkability Index. This dataset shares the SLD's block group boundary definitions from Census 2019. The methodology describing the process of creating the Walkability Index can be found in the documents located at https://edg.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/public/OA/WalkabilityIndex.zip.

A spatio-temporal downscaler for output from numerical models. J. of Agricultural, Biological,and Environmental Statistics 15, 176-197) is used to provide daily, predictive PM2.5 (daily average) and O3 (daily 8-hr maximum) surfaces for 2012, 2013, and 2014. Summer (O3) and annual (PM2.5) means calculated and published. The downscaling fusion model uses both air quality monitoring data from the National Air Monitoring Stations/State and Local Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS/SLAMS) and numerical output from the Models-3/Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ). Currently, predictions at the US census tract centroid locations within the 12 km CMAQ domain are archived. Predictions at the CMAQ grid cell centroids, or any desired set of locations could be provided if needed. Predictions are not provided on December 31st of any year because complete daily CMAQ output are not available on those days after conversion of GMT to local eastern time.",

             "description": "This web service contains the following layer: PM10 Nonattainment Areas (1987 NAAQS). Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NAA1987PM10/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

             "title": "US EPA Nonattainment Areas and Designations - Carbon Monoxide (1990 NAAQS) - Web Service Layer",
             "description": "This web service layer, Carbon Monoxide (1990 NAAQS), displays identified state level areas where carbon monoxide pollution has not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) established in 1990 for and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NonattainmentAreas/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/regcntct.html). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

             "description": "This web service contains the following layers: PM2.5 24hr 2006 NAAQS State Level and PM2.5 24hr 2006 NAAQS National. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NAA2006PM2524hour/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators).

             "description": "This web service contains the following layers: Ozone 2008 NAAQS NAA State Level and Ozone 2008 NAAQS NAA National Level. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NAA2008Ozone8hour/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

             "description": "This web service contains the following layer: PM2.5 Annual 2012 NAAQS State Level. Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NAA2012PM25Annual/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

             "description": "This web service contains layers that depict annual emissions for 2014 at the facility and county level for the following criterial pollutants: CO, Lead, NH3, NOx, PM10, PM25, SO2, and VOC. The National Emissions Inventory (NEI) is a comprehensive and detailed estimate of air emissions of criteria pollutants, criteria precursors, and hazardous air pollutants from air emissions sources. The NEI is released every three years based primarily upon data provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies for sources in their jurisdictions and supplemented by data developed by the US EPA. The NEI is built using the Emissions Inventory System (EIS) first to collect the data from State, Local, and Tribal air agencies and then to blend that data with other data sources. NEI point sources include emissions estimates for larger sources that are located at a fixed, stationary location. Point sources in the NEI include large industrial facilities and electric power plants, airports, and smaller industrial, non-industrial and commercial facilities. A small number of portable sources such as some asphalt or rock crushing operations are also included. Some states voluntarily also provide facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and livestock facilities, which are otherwise included in the NEI as nonpoint sources. The emissions potential of each facility determines whether that facility should be reported as a point source, according to emissions thresholds set in the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR). NEI Point Sources are all included in the EIS Point Data Category. NEI nonpoint sources include emissions estimates for sources which individually are too small in magnitude to report as point sources. These emissions sources are included in the NEI as a county total or tribal total (for participating tribes). Examples include residential heating, commercial combustion, asphalt paving, and commercial and consumer solvent use. NEI nonpoint sources are all included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category.",

Layers are drawn at all scales. The National Emission Inventory (NEI) is a comprehensive and detailed estimate of air emissions of criteria pollutants, criteria precursors, and hazardous air pollutants from air emissions sources. The NEI is released every three years based primarily upon data provided by State, Local, and Tribal air agencies for sources in their jurisdictions and supplemented by data developed by the US EPA. The NEI is built using the Emissions Inventory System (EIS) first to collect the data from State, Local, and Tribal air agencies and then to blend that data with other data sources. NEI point sources include emissions estimates for larger sources that are located at a fixed, stationary location. Point sources in the NEI include large industrial facilities and electric power plants, airports, and smaller industrial, non-industrial and commercial facilities. A small number of portable sources such as some asphalt or rock crushing operations are also included. Some states voluntarily also provide facilities such as dry cleaners, gas stations, and livestock facilities, which are otherwise included in the NEI as nonpoint sources. The emissions potential of each facility determines whether that facility should be reported as a point source, according to emissions thresholds set in the Air Emissions Reporting Rule (AERR). NEI Point Sources are all included in the EIS Point Data Category. NEI nonpoint sources include emissions estimates for sources which individually are too small in magnitude to report as point sources. These emissions sources are included in the NEI as a county total or tribal total (for participating tribes). Examples include residential heating, commercial combustion, asphalt paving, and commercial and consumer solvent use. NEI nonpoint sources are all included in the EIS Nonpoint Data Category.",

Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NonattainmentAreas/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated \"nonattainment\u201d areas (NAA)\". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However, that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants, which are called \"criteria\" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act, which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe, EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as \"criteria pollutants\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter), ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. For each criteria pollutant, there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another, and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment, and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \"criteria\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases, a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2, 3, or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day, other areas (so-called \"split areas\") have had delays of several months, ranging up to more than 2 years, between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as \"attainment\" (meeting), \"nonattainment\" (not meeting), or \"unclassifiable\" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state, local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect, the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to: https://www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html. Questions concerning the status of nonattainment areas, their classification and EPA policy should be directed to the appropriate Regional Offices (https://www.epa.gov/approved-sips/regional-sip-coordinators). EPA Headquarters should be contacted only when the Regional Office is unable to answer a question.",

             "title": "Critical Habitat for Endangered Species",
             "description": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides a program for the conservation of threatened and endangered species and the habitats in which they are found. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization (NMFS/NOAA) lead federal implementation of the ESA, though they are supported by other federal agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Section 7 of the ESA directs all Federal agencies to conserve endangered and threatened species and to use their authorities to ensure actions do not jeopardized the further existence of threatened and endangered species or adversely modify designated critical habitats. As part of the Section 7 coordination, federal agencies work with USFWS and NMFS to identify species found within the jurisdiction of the United that could be affected by actions carried out by the agency.    Of note, the US EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is responsible for ensuring that Agency actions under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) are in compliance with ESA. OPP determines if ESA-listed species or their designated critical habitat may be affected by pesticide products. Pesticide products that \u201cmay affect\u201d an ESA-listed species or its designated critical habitat may be subject to additional regulation.     Species ranges represent anywhere an individual of the listed species could be found based on the best available information at the time of delineation. As defined in ESA, critical habitat delineates habitat characteristics in specific geographical areas and may be occupied or unoccupied by a threatened or endangered species at the time of listing. These areas must contain physical or biological features essential to conservation of a species and may require special management considerations or protection. Critical habitat may also include areas that are not currently occupied by the species but that may be needed for their recovery. Range areas represent more generalized habitat where species are or could be found based on the best available information. For some species, best available information is based on site specific surveys. For others, it will be historical location information based on political boundaries. These areas are, therefore, less geographically explicit than critical habitat. Consideration of both the species range and critical habitat ensures the conservation of the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend.    To support EPA\u2019s implementation of ESA, critical habitat and range data for species listed under ESA Section 7 were obtained by the US EPA from the USFWS Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS) database in November 2020. These data were supplemented with areas provided by NOAA\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) where NOAA has species authority. For NMFS species not found in either location, a request was made directly to the NMFS scientists. The last download of the species locations occurred in November 2020.",

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization (NMFS/NOAA) lead federal implementation of the ESA, though they are supported by other federal agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Section 7 of the ESA directs all Federal agencies to conserve endangered and threatened species and to use their authorities to ensure actions do not jeopardized the further existence of threatened and endangered species or adversely modify designated critical habitats. As part of the Section 7 coordination, federal agencies work with USFWS and NMFS to identify species found within the jurisdiction of the United that could be affected by actions carried out by the agency.    Of note, the US EPA\u2019s Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is responsible for ensuring that Agency actions under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) are in compliance with ESA. OPP determines if ESA-listed species or their designated critical habitat may be affected by pesticide products. Pesticide products that \u201cmay affect\u201d an ESA-listed species or its designated critical habitat may be subject to additional regulation.     Species ranges represent anywhere an individual of the listed species could be found based on the best available information at the time of delineation. As defined in ESA, critical habitat delineates habitat characteristics in specific geographical areas and may be occupied or unoccupied by a threatened or endangered species at the time of listing. These areas must contain physical or biological features essential to conservation of a species and may require special management considerations or protection. Critical habitat may also include areas that are not currently occupied by the species but that may be needed for their recovery. Range areas represent more generalized habitat where species are or could be found based on the best available information. For some species, best available information is based on site specific surveys. For others, it will be historical location information based on political boundaries. These areas are, therefore, less geographically explicit than critical habitat. Consideration of both the species range and critical habitat ensures the conservation of the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend.    To support EPA\u2019s implementation of ESA, critical habitat and range data for species listed under ESA Section 7 were obtained by the US EPA from the USFWS Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS) database in November 2020. These data were supplemented with areas provided by NOAA\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) where NOAA has species authority. For NMFS species not found in either location, a request was made directly to the NMFS scientists. The last download of the species locations occurred in November 2020.",

             "description": "This map service displays Level III and Level IV Ecoregions of the United States and was created from ecoregion data obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Research and Development's Western Ecology Division. The original ecoregion data was projected from Albers to Web Mercator for this map service. To download shapefiles of ecoregion data (in Albers), please go to: https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html#ORD/Ecoregions/. IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT LEVEL IV POLYGON LEGEND DISPLAY IN ARCMAP: Due to the limitations of Graphical Device Interface (GDI) resources per application on Windows, ArcMap does not display the legend in the Table of Contents for the ArcGIS Server service layer if the legend has more than 100 items. As of December 2011, there are 968 unique legend items in the Level IV Ecoregion Polygon legend. Follow this link (http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/33741) for instructions about how to increase the maximum number of ArcGIS Server service layer legend items allowed for display in ArcMap. Note the instructions at this link provide a slightly incorrect path to \"Maximum Legend Count\". The correct path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > ESRI > ArcMap > Server > MapServerLayer > Maximum Legend Count. When editing the \"Maximum Legend Count\", update the field, \"Value data\" to 1000. To download a PDF version of the Level IV ecoregion map and legend, go to https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ORD/Ecoregions/us/Eco_Level_IV_US_pg.pdf. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions (n = 968) are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

             "description": "These data provide mapping, display, and analysis capabilities for the TRI National Analysis data at the following geographic levels: state, county, large aquatic ecosystem, metro/micropolitan statistical area, and facility. See the links below for data from specific reporting years. The TRI National Analysis is EPA's annual interpretation and summary of the most recent TRI data. It highlights how toxic chemical wastes were managed, where toxic chemicals were released and in what quantities, and how the TRI data compare to data from previous years. This dataset reports US, state, county, large aquatic ecosystem, metro/micropolitan statistical area, and facility level statistics of TRI releases, including information on: number of TRI facilities in the geographic area and their releases (total releases, as well as releases to water, air, and land); population information, including populations living within 1 mile of TRI facilities (total population, percent minority, and in percent under the poverty line); and Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model related pounds, toxicity-weighted pounds, and RSEI score. The source of administrative boundary data is the 2013 cartographic boundary shapefiles. Location of facilities is provided by EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS). Large Aquatic Ecosystems boundaries were derived from the hydrologic unit boundaries and codes for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was revised for inclusion in the National Atlas of the United States of America (November 2002), and updated to match the streams file created by the USGS National Mapping Division (NMD) for the National Atlas of the United States of America.",

             "description": "The purpose of the American Indian and Alaska Native Land Area Representation (AIAN-LAR) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset is to depict the external extent of federal Indian reservations and the external extent of associated land held in \u201ctrust\u201d by the United States, \u201crestricted fee\u201d or \u201cmixed ownership\u201d status for federally recognized tribes and individual Indians. This dataset includes other land area types such as Public Domain Allotments, Dependent Indian Communities and Homesteads. This GIS Dataset is prepared strictly for illustrative and reference purposes only and should not be used, and is not intended for legal, survey, engineering or navigation purposes. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for the use of the data for purposes not intended by the BIA. This GIS Dataset may contain errors. There is no impact on the legal status of the land areas depicted herein and no impact on land ownership. No legal inference can or should be made from the information in this GIS Dataset. The GIS Dataset is to be used solely for illustrative, reference and statistical purposes and may be used for government to government Tribal consultation. Reservation boundary data is limited in authority to those areas where there has been settled Congressional definition or final judicial interpretation of the boundary. Absent settled Congressional definition or final judicial interpretation of a reservation boundary, the BIA recommends consultation with the appropriate Tribe and then the BIA to obtain interpretations of the reservation boundary. The land areas and their representations are compilations defined by the official land title records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) which include treaties, statutes, Acts of Congress, agreements, executive orders, proclamations, deeds and other land title documents. The trust, restricted, and mixed ownership land area shown here, are suitable only for general spatial reference and do not represent the federal government\u2019s position on the jurisdictional status of Indian country. Ownership and jurisdictional status is subject to change and must be verified with plat books, patents, and deeds in the appropriate federal and state offices. Included in this dataset are the exterior extent of off reservation trust, restricted fee tracts and mixed tracts of land including Public Domain allotments, Dependent Indian Communities, Homesteads and government administered lands and those set aside for schools and dormitories. There are also land areas where there is more than one tribe having an interest in or authority over a tract of land but this information is not specified in the AIAN-LAR dataset. The dataset includes both surface and subsurface tracts of land (tribal and individually held) \u201coff reservation\u201d tracts and not simply off reservation \u201callotments\u201d as land has in many cases been subsequently acquired in trust. These data are public information and may be used by various organizations, agencies, units of government (i.e., Federal, state, county, and city), and other entities according to the restrictions on appropriate use. It is strongly recommended that these data be acquired directly from the BIA and not indirectly through some other source, which may have altered or integrated the data for another purpose for which they may not have been intended. Integrating land areas into another dataset and attempting to resolve boundary differences between other entities may produce inaccurate results. It is also strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the content of the metadata file associated with these data. Users are cautioned that digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than those at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation. The BIA AIAN-LAR dataset\u2019s spatial accuracy and attribute information are continuously being updated, improved and is used as the single authoritative land area boundary data for the BIA mission. These data are available through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of Trust Services, Division of Land Titles and Records, Branch of Geospatial Support.",

             "description": "EJSCREEN is an environmental justice (EJ) screening and mapping tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and methodology for calculating \"EJ indexes,\" which can be used for highlighting places that may be candidates for further review, analysis, or outreach as the agency develops programs, policies and other activities. The tool provides both summary and detailed information at the Census block group level or a user-defined area for both demographic and environmental indicators. The summary information is in the form of EJ Indexes which combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts. The tool also provides additional detailed demographic and environmental information to supplement screening analyses. EJSCREEN displays this information in color-coded maps, bar charts, and standard reports. Users should keep in mind that screening tools are subject to substantial uncertainty in their demographic and environmental data, particularly when looking at small geographic areas, such as Census block groups. Data on the full range of environmental impacts and demographic factors in any given location are almost certainly not available directly through this tool, and its initial results should be supplemented with additional information and local knowledge before making any judgments about potential areas of EJ concern. The National-scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) environmental indicators and EJ indexes, which include cancer risk, respiratory hazard, neurodevelopment hazard, and diesel particulate matter will be added into EJSCREEN during the first full public update after the soon-to-be-released 2011 dataset is made available. All NATA associated indicator and index elements are currently set to \"Null\".",

The tool provides both summary and detailed information at the Census block group level or a user-defined area for both demographic and environmental indicators. The summary information is in the form of EJ Indexes which combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts. The tool also provides additional detailed demographic and environmental information to supplement screening analyses. EJSCREEN displays this information in color-coded maps, bar charts, and standard reports. Users should keep in mind that screening tools are subject to substantial uncertainty in their demographic and environmental data, particularly when looking at small geographic areas, such as Census block groups. Data on the full range of environmental impacts and demographic factors in any given location are almost certainly not available directly through this tool, and its initial results should be supplemented with additional information and local knowledge before making any judgments about potential areas of EJ concern.",

             "description": "EJSCREEN is an environmental justice (EJ) screening and mapping tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and methodology for calculating \"EJ indexes,\" which can be used for highlighting places that may be candidates for further review, analysis, or outreach as the agency develops programs, policies and other activities. The tool provides both summary and detailed information at the Census block group level or a user-defined area for both demographic and environmental indicators. The summary information is in the form of EJ Indexes which combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts. The tool also provides additional detailed demographic and environmental information to supplement screening analyses. EJSCREEN displays this information in color-coded maps, bar charts, and standard reports. Users should keep in mind that screening tools are subject to substantial uncertainty in their demographic and environmental data, particularly when looking at small geographic areas, such as Census block groups. Data on the full range of environmental impacts and demographic factors in any given location are almost certainly not available directly through this tool, and its initial results should be supplemented with additional information and local knowledge before making any judgments about potential areas of EJ concern.",

             "description": "EJScreen is an environmental justice (EJ) screening and mapping tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and methodology for calculating \"EJ indexes,\" which can be used for highlighting places that may be candidates for further review, analysis, or outreach as the agency develops programs, policies and other activities. The tool provides both summary and detailed information at the Census block group level or a user-defined area for both demographic and environmental indicators. The summary information is in the form of EJ Indexes which combine demographic information with a single environmental indicator (such as proximity to traffic) that can help identify communities living in areas with greater potential for environmental and health impacts. The tool also provides additional detailed demographic and environmental information to supplement screening analyses. EJScreen displays this information in color-coded maps, bar charts, and standard reports. Users should keep in mind that screening tools are subject to substantial uncertainty in their demographic and environmental data, particularly when looking at small geographic areas, such as Census block groups. Data on the full range of environmental impacts and demographic factors in any given location are almost certainly not available directly through this tool, and its initial results should be supplemented with additional information and local knowledge before making any judgments about potential areas of EJ concern.",

All data sets are assigned values at the Census block group level.\n\nA block group is considered as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d based on any of the following three criteria:\n\n\u2022 Inclusion of the CJEST disadvantaged communities. A block group is identified as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d when it is part of the CJEST \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d tract.\n\n\u2022 Supplemental index exceedance. A block group is identified as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d when any of the 13 Supplemental EJ Indexes are at or above 90 percentiles. Both national and state supplemental indexes are used.\n\n\u2022 Overlapping with Alaska Native Allotments, Alaska Native Villages, American Indian Reservations, Off-reservation Trust Lands, or Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas. For tribal areas that are larger than the local block groups, a block group is marked \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d when at least 10% of the block group intersects the tribal area For tribal areas that are smaller than the local block groups, a block group is marked \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d when at least 10% of the tribal area covers the block group.  \n",

Based on nominations of eligible census tracts by the Chief Executive Officers of each State, Treasury has completed its designation of Qualified Opportunity Zones. Each State nominated the maximum number of eligible tracts, per statute, and these designations are final. The statute and legislative history of the Opportunity Zone designations, under IRC \u00a7 1400Z, do not contemplate an opportunity for additional or revised designations after the maximum number of zones allowable have been designated in a State or Territory. The data in this layer was updated in January 2021.

Generators of hazardous waste are regulated based on the amount of hazardous waste they generate in a calendar month, not the size of their business or facility. This data includes 5 categories of hazardous waste generators:\n\nLQG: Large Quantity Generators (LQGs), as part of EPA\u2019s RCRAInfo system, generate 1,000 kilograms per month or more of hazardous waste or more than one kilogram per month of acutely hazardous waste. The data are extracted from RCRAInfo with the GENSTATUS flag that equals \u201cLQG\u201d.\n\nSQG: Small Quantity Generators (SQGs), as part of EPA\u2019s RCRAInfo system,  generate more than 100 kilograms, but less than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month. The data are extracted from RCRAInfo with the GENSTATUS flag that equals \u201cSQG\u201d.\n\nVSQG: Very Small Quantity Generators (VSQGs), as part of EPA\u2019s RCRAInfo system, generate 100 kilograms or less per month of hazardous waste or one kilogram or less per month of acutely hazardous waste. The data are extracted from RCRAInfo with the GENSTATUS flag that equals \u201cVSQG\u201d.\n\nCEG: Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQGs), as part of EPA\u2019s RCRAInfo system,  generate no more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month. The data are extracted from RCRAInfo with the GENSTATUS flag that equals \u201cCEG\u201d (CEG is a standardized tag for CESQG in RCRAInfo database).\n\nTDSF: The Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDF) are the generators of EPA\u2019s RCRAInfo system that generate, treat, store, and dispose of hazardous waste. The data are extracted from RCRAInfo with the ACTIVE_SITE flag that contains \u201cP\u201d. \n",

Instead, the IGMS grant recipients mailing address is the primary source for grant locations. Particularly for statewide grants that are administered via State and Regional headquarters, the grant location data should not be interpreted as the grants place of performance. In 2012, a policy was established to start to collect the place of performance as a pilot for newly awarded grants that were deemed community-based in nature and for these the grant location depicted in this database will be a more reliable indicator of the actual place of performance. As for the locational accuracy of these points, there is no programmatic certification process, however, they are being entered by the Grant Project Officers who are most familiar with the details of the grants, apart from the grantees themselves. Limitations notwithstanding, this is a first-of-breed attempt to map all of the Agencys grants, using the best internal geocoding algorithms available, and is a useful tool for getting to an understanding of the distribution of USEPA grant-giving.

EPA developed national level site screening criteria in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal facilities. While the screening criteria demonstrate the potential to reuse contaminated land for renewable energy facilities, the criteria and data are neither designed to identify the best sites for developing renewable energy nor all-inclusive. Therefore, more detailed, site-specific analysis is necessary to identify or prioritize the best sites for developing renewable energy facilities based on the technical and economic potential. Please note that these sites were only pre-screened for renewable energy potential. The sites were not evaluated for land use constraints or current on the ground conditions. Additional research and site-specific analysis are needed to verify viability for renewable energy potential at a given site. ",

Using publically available information, RE-Powering maintains a list of completed renewable energy installations on contaminated sites and landfills. To date, the RE-Powering Initiative has identified 179 renewable energy installations on 171 contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites, with a cumulative installed capacity of just over 1,124 megawatts (MW) and consistent growth in total installations since the inception of the RE-Powering Initiative. This dataset is current as of April 2016.",

             "description": "This asset includes the EPA Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket (Docket), which is required by Section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).  The Docket contains information reported to EPA by federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants have been or may be released. The Docket serves three major purposes:\n1. To identify all federal facilities that must be evaluated through the site assessment process to determine whether they pose a risk to human health and the environment sufficient to warrant inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL); \n2. To compile and maintain the information submitted to EPA on such facilities under the provisions listed in section 120(c) of CERCLA; and\n3. To provide a mechanism to make the information available to the public.\nThe docket includes facilities which have provided information to EPA through documents such as reports under a Federal agency environmental restoration program, regardless of the absence of section 103 reporting. E-Docket is an internal business management tool that will improve the tracking and record keeping of information about facilities that have been identified as potential Docket sites. The functionality of the system is basic record tracking, and it will contain a list of draft proposed facilities which can be sorted based on Agency ownership, region, or status (Draft Proposed, Proposed, Added, or Not Added). The information compiled in the tool is publicly available. \nThe data asset also includes the FFRRO Regional Work Planning Application, which is a tool for the Superfund Federal Facilities Response Program. It collects regional site-specific planning targets for program measures. This data is entered by the regions and used by HQ to estimate and target program accomplishments.",

From May 18-June 6, 2010, EPA\u2019s TAGA buses monitored for the two chemicals found in the COREXIT dispersants that have the highest potential to get into the air in any significant amounts: EGBE (2-butoxyethanol) and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether. In addition to being found in the COREXIT dispersants, these compounds are found in cleaning products and coatings. As a result, we have not beeen able to identify the source of the measured compounds. The TAGA buses detected very low levels of these chemicals in the air, at a limited number of the locations sampled along the Gulf Coast. The levels found were well below those that are likely to cause health effects, and suggest that the use of dispersants on the oil spill would not have a significant impact on air quality on land.",
