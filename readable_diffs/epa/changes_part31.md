The data are the number of mutant colonies (called revertants or rev) per petri plate of strain TA100 of Salmonella using the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay as described below.\nGeneration of Simulated Atmospheres.  The details of how the atmospheres were generated have been described previously.  Briefly, the precursor hydrocarbon, along with NO and low concentration ammonium sulfate seed aerosol, were injected continuously into a 14.5-m3 smog chamber until concentrations of ~10 ppmC hydrocarbon and ~500 ppbv NO were achieved.  Relative humidity within the chamber was held at 30%. The mixture was then irradiated and allowed to come to steady state before exposing the Salmonella cells at the air-agar interface to the resulting atmosphere to assess mutagenic potential.  Input and sampling flows were such that the average chamber residence time was ~4.5 h.    \nMutagenicity Assays.  The Salmonella plate-incorporation assay using the base-substitution strain TA100 was used as described previously. When the smog-chamber reactions reached steady state, we delivered a continuous and constant concentration of the atmosphere into the MICs.  We exposed the cells for 5 or more time periods spanning 10 min to 16 h, depending on the mutagenic potency and cytotoxicity of the atmosphere.  After exposures, we incubated the plates at 37C for 3 days and then counted the resulting mutant colonies, revertants (rev), on an automatic colony counter (ProtoCOL 3, Microbiology International, Frederick, MD). We conducted two independent mutagenicity experiments with two plates per time point with each atmosphere, resulting in a total of four plates per time point.  We combined the mutagenicity data (rev plate-1) from two replicate experiments to construct exposure time-response curves from which we calculated linear regressions; the slopes were the mutagenic potencies of the atmospheres expressed as rev h-1.  These rev h-1 values were normalized to the estimated mass concentration of non-precursor gas-phase carbon during the exposure to give mutagenic potencies expressed as rev m3 mgC-1 h-1 \u00b1 SE.  A positive mutagenic response was considered to be a reproducible, time-related increase in rev plate-1 that approached or exceeded a twofold increase relative to the unexposed spontaneous control and whose slopes were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than zero based on a trend test.  Linear regressions (slopes), p-values, and r2-values were calculated using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

As such, some developmental and reproductive toxicology studies now require or suggest serum total thyroxine (T4) measurements in pregnant, lactating, and developing rats. However, serum T4 concentrations are normally low in the fetus and pup which makes accurate quantification difficult. These challenges can be circumvented by technologies like mass spectrometry, but these approaches are expensive and not always widely available. To demonstrate the feasibility of measuring serum T4 using a commercially available kit we compare T4 concentrations in pregnant, fetal, and neonatal rats, as measured by both liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). The sera samples analyzed were obtained from rats on gestational day 20 (dams and fetuses) or postnatal day 5 (pups), following a maternal exposure to the goitrogen propylthiouracil (0-3 ppm) to incrementally decrease T4. We show that with optimization, it is possible to measure serum T4 using low sample volumes (25-50\u03bcL) by RIA and the relative control values obtained are comparable to LC/MS/MS. This work demonstrates that low concentrationT4 quantification is feasible for toxicological studies, but attention to technical detail is pertinent. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nO'Shaughnessy, K., M.

-            "description": "The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) supports a large aquaculture industry and is a keystone species along the Atlantic seaboard. Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 \u00b5g/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that metabolic effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point, and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e. Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected metabolic pathways associated with anaerobic metabolism, osmotic stress and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects from each chemical\u2019s postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that metabolic disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis and many of its affected metabolic pathways were not well-predicted from the individual treatments. This research highlights the utility of untargeted metabolomics in developing exposure biomarkers for compounds with differing modes of action in bivalves. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBrew, D., M.

-            "description": "Background: Azo dyes are used in textiles and leather clothing. Human exposure can occur from wearing textiles containing azo dyes. Since the body\u2019s enzymes and microbiome can cleave azo dyes, potentially resulting in mutagenic or carcinogenic metabolites, there is also an indirect health concern on the parent compounds. While several hazardous azo dyes are banned, many more are still in use that have not been evaluated systematically for potential health concerns. This systematic evidence map (SEM) aims to compile and categorize the available toxicological evidence on the potential human health risks of a set of 30 market-relevant azo dyes. Methods: Peer-reviewed and gray literature was searched and over 20,000 studies were identified. These were filtered using Sciome Workbench for Interactive computer-Facilitated Text-mining (SWIFT) Review software with evidence stream tags (human, animal, in vitro) yielding 12,800 unique records. SWIFT Active (a machine-learning software) further facilitated title/abstract screening. DistillerSR software was used for additional title/ abstract, full-text screening, and data extraction. Results: 187 studies were identified that met populations, exposures, comparators, and outcomes (PECO) criteria. From this pool, 54 human, 78 animal, and 61 genotoxicity studies were extracted into a literature inventory. Toxicological evidence was abundant for three azo dyes (also used as food additives) and sparse for five of the remaining 27 compounds. Complementary search in ECHA\u2019s REACH database for summaries of unpublished study reports revealed evidence for all 30 dyes. The question arose of how this information can be fed into an SEM process. Proper identification of prioritized dyes from various databases (including U.S. EPA\u2019s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) turned out to be a challenge. Evidence compiled by this SEM project can be evaluated for subsequent use in problem formulation efforts to inform potential regulatory needs and prepare for a more efficient and targeted evaluation in the future for human health assessments. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKeshava, C., S.

CMAQ estimates were from simulations of the Northern Hemisphere with horizontal grid spacing of 108 km x 108 km.  Model estimates were extracted from the lowest CMAQ model layer (\u223c\u200910\u2009m in thickness) for a source area over the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the island from 14.3989 to 11.45667\u00b0\u2009N latitude and 59.5627 to 56.54487\u00b0\u2009W longitude (equivalent to 16 model grid cells with 1 cell over Ragged Point and the others to the east of the site).  Modeled meteorological estimates (surface temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed) for the same set of grid cells was also extracted from simulations of the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model used in the EQUATES project. Data for each model variable are provided as text files (one file for each variable and year) including date, grid cell center longitude and latitude, grid cell elevation and the the daily average model concentrations.  Text files are compressed into .zip files for each variable. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGaston, C., J. Prospero, K. Foley, H. Pye, L. Custals, E. Blades, P.

CMAQ estimates were from simulations of the Northern Hemisphere with horizontal grid spacing of 108 km x 108 km.  Model estimates were extracted from the lowest CMAQ model layer (\u223c\u200910\u2009m in thickness) for a source area over the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the island from 14.3989 to 11.45667\u00b0\u2009N latitude and 59.5627 to 56.54487\u00b0\u2009W longitude (equivalent to 16 model grid cells with 1 cell over Ragged Point and the others to the east of the site).  Modeled meteorological estimates (surface temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed) for the same set of grid cells was also extracted from simulations of the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model used in the EQUATES project. Data for each model variable are provided as text files (one file for each variable and year) including date, grid cell center longitude and latitude, grid cell elevation and the the daily average model concentrations.  Text files are compressed into .zip files for each variable. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGaston, C., J. Prospero, K. Foley, H. Pye, L. Custals, E. Blades, P. Sealy, and J. Christie. Diverging trends in aerosol sulfate and nitrate measured in the remote North Atlantic on Barbados are attributed to clean air policies, African smoke, and anthropogenic emissions.

Across the studies with absolute liver weights and relative-to-body (RLW) liver weights, the treatment-related mean effect values at the lowest effect (LE) dose levels as well as mean control liver weights were determined for all chemical-study-sex-species-exposure route groupings. The LE-ALW and LE-RLW changes were quantified as effect size differences from control using the following equation:\nEffect_size = 100 x (LE Effect_value \u2013 Control Effect_Value) / Control Effect_Value\n\nAny microscopic liver pathology effects occurring at the corresponding LE dose level of weight change were also identified and listed in the dataset.

The map uses a combined land use/land cover map from the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL). It combines agriculture, forests, grasslands and wetlands with stream networks and elevation datasets in flow path models to find agricultural flow paths that do or do not intersect buffers, and counts the agricultural flow paths through buffers adjacent to streams in order to determine average buffer widths on agricultural lands.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015 version) map. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Big game includes deer, elk, bear, and wild turkey. These values are based on 2010 population distribution, 2011 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Fish, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (FHWAR) survey data, and 2011 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring program data, and have been summarized by 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics.

Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, as well as a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. The EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

This area includes the majority of Jefferson County and a large percentage of Shelby County, as well as very small portions of Bibb, Blount, Chilton, and St. Clair counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) that were collected in summer 2011. LiDAR datasets collected in 2010, 2011 and 2013 were also used to create this MULC. Six land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were obtained from the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer.
