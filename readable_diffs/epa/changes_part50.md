+            "description": "Background: Azo dyes are used in textiles and leather clothing. Human exposure can occur from wearing textiles containing azo dyes. Since the body\u2019s enzymes and microbiome can cleave azo dyes, potentially resulting in mutagenic or carcinogenic metabolites, there is also an indirect health concern on the parent compounds. While several hazardous azo dyes are banned, many more are still in use that have not been evaluated systematically for potential health concerns. This systematic evidence map (SEM) aims to compile and categorize the available toxicological evidence on the potential human health risks of a set of 30 market-relevant azo dyes. Methods: Peer-reviewed and gray literature was searched and over 20,000 studies were identified. These were filtered using Sciome Workbench for Interactive computer-Facilitated Text-mining (SWIFT) Review software with evidence stream tags (human, animal, in vitro) yielding 12,800 unique records. SWIFT Active (a machine-learning software) further facilitated title/abstract screening. DistillerSR software was used for additional title/ abstract, full-text screening, and data extraction. Results: 187 studies were identified that met populations, exposures, comparators, and outcomes (PECO) criteria. From this pool, 54 human, 78 animal, and 61 genotoxicity studies were extracted into a literature inventory. Toxicological evidence was abundant for three azo dyes (also used as food additives) and sparse for five of the remaining 27 compounds. Complementary search in ECHA\u2019s REACH database for summaries of unpublished study reports revealed evidence for all 30 dyes. The question arose of how this information can be fed into an SEM process. Proper identification of prioritized dyes from various databases (including U.S. EPA\u2019s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) turned out to be a challenge. Evidence compiled by this SEM project can be evaluated for subsequent use in problem formulation efforts to inform potential regulatory needs and prepare for a more efficient and targeted evaluation in the future for human health assessments. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKeshava, C., S.

CMAQ estimates were from simulations of the Northern Hemisphere with horizontal grid spacing of 108 km x 108 km.  Model estimates were extracted from the lowest CMAQ model layer (\u223c\u200910\u2009m in thickness) for a source area over the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the island from 14.3989 to 11.45667\u00b0\u2009N latitude and 59.5627 to 56.54487\u00b0\u2009W longitude (equivalent to 16 model grid cells with 1 cell over Ragged Point and the others to the east of the site).  Modeled meteorological estimates (surface temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed) for the same set of grid cells was also extracted from simulations of the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model used in the EQUATES project. Data for each model variable are provided as text files (one file for each variable and year) including date, grid cell center longitude and latitude, grid cell elevation and the the daily average model concentrations.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset estimates the average agricultural buffer width, the percentage of agricultural lands with flow paths that would intersect natural land cover before reaching a stream, and the percentage of each subwatershed (12-digit HUC) that is unbuffered agricultural land. Subwatershed summaries are calculated for the contiguous United States. The map uses a combined land use/land cover map from the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL). It combines agriculture, forests, grasslands and wetlands with stream networks and elevation datasets in flow path models to find agricultural flow paths that do or do not intersect buffers, and counts the agricultural flow paths through buffers adjacent to streams in order to determine average buffer widths on agricultural lands. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Agricultural Water Demand by 12-Digit HUC for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "The national agricultural water demand metric provides insight into the amount of water used for agricultural irrigation in the contiguous United States. The estimates are derived from a water usage rate per 30m cell based on 2010 irrigation water use; an indication of agricultural irrigation based on 2011 crop, 2011 land use, and 2007/2012 remotely sensed irrigation; and summarized by watershed or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). Agricultural irrigation water use, as defined in this case, meets a variety of needs before, during, and after growing seasons (e.g., dust suppression, field preparation, chemical application, weed control, salt removal from root zones, frost protection, crop cooling, and harvesting). Estimates include self-supplied surface and groundwater, as well as supplies from irrigation-specific organizations (e.g., companies, districts, cooperatives, government). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Values are provided for total oxidized nitrogen (HNO3, NO, NO2, N2O5, NH3, HONO, PAN, organic nitrogen, and particulate NO3), oxidized nitrogen wet deposition, oxidized nitrogen dry deposition, total reduced nitrogen (NH3 and particulate NH4), reduced nitrogen dry deposition, reduced nitrogen wet deposition, total dry nitrogen deposition, total wet nitrogen deposition, total nitrogen deposition (wet+dry), total sulfur (SO2 + particulate SO4) dry deposition, total sulfur wet deposition, and total sulfur deposition.  The dataset is based on output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) run using the bidirectional flux option for the 12-km grid size for the US, Canada, and Mexico. The CMAQ output has been post-processed to adjust the wet deposition for errors in the location and amount of precipitation and for regional biases in the TNO3 (HNO3 + NO3), NHx (NH4 + NH3), and sulfate wet deposition.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Residential water use reporting in the EnviroAtlas-defined study area is available through the Texas Water Development Board. Within the Austin study area, there are thirteen community estimates from 2012 ranging from 65 to 303 GPD.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset provides the average annual precipitation by 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC). The values were estimated from maps produced by the PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University. The original data was at the scale of 800 m grid cells representing average precipitation from 1981-2010 in mm. The data was converted to inches of precipitation and then zonal statistics were estimated for a final value of average annual precipitation for each 12 digit HUC. For more information about the original dataset please refer to the PRISM website at http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains species richness metrics based on habitat models generated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Gap Analysis Project (GAP). Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 24 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrate species. Metrics include all species richness, taxa specific species richness and other lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University, US EPA, and USGS to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "The Birmingham, AL EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 2,778 km2 around the city of Birmingham and portions of surrounding counties. The area classified is based on the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Area for Birmingham, AL with a 1 km buffer added. This area includes the majority of Jefferson County and a large percentage of Shelby County, as well as very small portions of Bibb, Blount, Chilton, and St. Clair counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) that were collected in summer 2011. LiDAR datasets collected in 2010, 2011 and 2013 were also used to create this MULC. Six land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Tree/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were obtained from the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 500 completely random and 95 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded an overall user's accuracy of 83.4% (MAX) and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy of 87.6% (RIGHT) (see confusion matrices below).

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Bird National Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Metrics by 12-digit HUC for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This dataset was produced by a joint effort of New Mexico State University (NMSU), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems, have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, or cultural and aesthetic values). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. We map 15 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for bird species. Metrics include all bird species richness, lists identifying species of conservation concern, climate vulnerabilities, etc. This dataset was produced by the Center for Applied Spatial Ecology, New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit (NMCFWRU), NMSU to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "The Baltimore, MD EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 4,545 km2 around the city of Baltimore and portions of surrounding counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and infrared light) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints). Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees, Grass/Herbaceous, Agriculture, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer from the years 1981, 1999, and 2013 (http://wetlands.fws.gov). An analysis of about 600 completely random and 90 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 90% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 93% within the census block group boundary (see confusion matrices below). These data were developed as part of the Chesapeake Bay High-Resolution Land Cover Project, a cooperative agreement between the Chesapeake Conservancy and the National Park Service, funded through an interagency agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Chesapeake Conservancy, under the direction of Margaret Markham, created the initial statewide 1-meter land cover data. EPA added agriculture and wetlands taken from ancillary data sources. See detailed processing steps and workflow below.

The road width is estimated for each road and percent tree cover is calculated in a 8.5 meter strip beginning at the estimated road edge. Percent tree cover is calculated for each block between road intersections. In this community, tree cover is defined as Trees & Forest and Woody Wetlands. Tree cover provides valuable benefits to neighborhood residents and walkers by providing shade, improved aesthetics, and outdoor gathering spaces.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Biological nitrogen fixation in natural/semi-natural ecosystems by 12-digit HUC for the Conterminous United States, 2006",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean biological nitrogen fixation in natural/semi-natural ecosystems per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated using a correlation with actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999). AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation describing the correlation of AET with climate (average annual daily temperature, average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual maximum daily temperature, and annual precipitation) and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous US (Sanford and Selnick 2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum daily temperatures and total precipitation for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM climate dataset (http://prism.oregonstate.edu). Average annual climate data were then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html; 22 March 2011 release) using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0. AET for individual HUC12s was estimated using equations described in Sanford and Selnick (2013). BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled with an equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1 yr-1) and actual evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion of non-developed and non-agricultural land in the HUC12. The first half of the equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the central and high estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that suggest that natural BNF rates are less than previous estimates based on scaled-up estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The land use/land cover modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We believe it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with large proportions of urban or agricultural development. These data represent an average N input to individual HUC12s, i.e., they are not specific to an individual land use type within the HUC12. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Cultivated biological nitrogen fixation in agricultural lands by 12-digit HUC in the Conterminous United States, 2006",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean cultivated biological nitrogen fixation (C-BNF) in cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Nitrogen (N) inputs from the cultivation of legumes, which possess a symbiotic relationship with N-fixing bacteria, were calculated with a recently developed model relating county-level yields of various leguminous crops with BNF rates. We accessed county-level data on annual crop yields for soybeans (Glycine max L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), various dry beans (Phaseolus, Cicer, and Lens spp.), and dry peas (Pisum spp.) for 2006 from the USDA Census of Agriculture (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). We estimated the yield of the non-alfalfa leguminous component of hay as 32% of the yield of total non-alfalfa hay (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). Annual rates of C-BNF by crop type were calculated using a model that relates yield to C-BNF. We assume yield data reflect differences in soil properties, water availability, temperature, and other local and regional factors that can influence root nodulation and rate of N fixation. We distributed county-specific, C-BNF rates to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands delineated in the 2006 National Land Cover Database (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county. C-BNF data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types.

Ecological restoration may become a more prominent means of environmental conservation in the future, and landscape context and connectivity are important emerging principles in ecological restoration science.

             "description": "As included in the EnviroAtlas, the community level domestic water use is calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Local use data, as prepared for several cities for the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and at the county level by USGS, were used. Within the Chicago study area, the 1998-2010 average estimates ranged from 33 to 196 GPD.

             "description": "The Chicago, IL EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 14,687 km2 around the city of Chicago and surrounding counties in Illinois and Indiana. The study area spans 10 counties (7 in Illinois, 3 in Indiana). These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) as well as ancillary vector data (e.g., roads, building footprints). Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, Agriculture, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were delineated using the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer. An analysis of 600 completely random and 97 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded a simple overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 81% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 87% (see confusion matrices below). This dataset was produced by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, the United States Forest Service Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessment program, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "The Cleveland, OH EnviroAtlas Meter-scale Urban Land Cover (MULC) dataset comprises 2,737 km2 around the city of Cleveland and portions of surrounding counties. The area classified is based on the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Area for Cleveland, OH with a 1 km buffer added. This area includes the majority of Cuyahoga and Lake Counties, and portions of Ashtabula, Geauga, Medina, Lorain, Portage and Summit Counties. These MULC data and maps were derived from LiDAR and 1-m pixel, four-band (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) leaf-on aerial photography acquired from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) in 2011 and 2013. The NAIP imagery was collected on several dates: August 12, 2011, September 03, 2011 and August 24, 2013. The data was comprised of 85% 2011 NAIP and 15% 2013 NAIP imagery. LiDAR data collected between March 18, 2006 and May 07, 2006 covered the entire study area. Six land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious Surfaces, Soil/Barren, Trees/Forest, Grass/Herbaceous Non-Woody Vegetation, and Wetlands (Woody and Emergent). Wetlands were copied from the best available existing wetlands data, which was a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) layer from 2006. An analysis of 500 completely random and 81 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference points yielded an overall user's accuracy of 86.2% (see confusion matrix below).

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset describes the block group population and the percentage of the block group population that has potential views of water bodies. A potential view of water is defined as having a body of water that is greater than 300m2 within 50m of a residential location. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home. The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015) map. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas ) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas ) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

In addition to the three climate variables provided by the NEX-DCP30 dataset (minimum monthly temperature, maximum monthly temperature, and precipitation) a corresponding estimate of potential evapotranspiration (PET) was developed to match the spatial and temporal scales of the input dataset. PET represents the cumulative amount of water returned to the atmosphere due to evaporation from Earth\u2019s surface and plant transpiration under ideal circumstances (i.e., a vegetated surface shading the ground and unlimited water supply). PET was calculated using the Hamon PET equation (Hamon, 1961) and CBM model for daylength (Forsythe et al. 1995) for the 4 RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and organized by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) and annually for the years 2006 \u2013 2099.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Cluster analysis for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains the results of a cluster analysis of ecological integrity indices for stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Points",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset is a point feature class showing the locations of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

This dataset was produced through a partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This cyanobacteria dataset was derived using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Envisat MERIS sensor and their Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor. MERIS and OLCI are nadir-pointing imaging spectrometers which measure the solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 15 and 21 spectral bands, respectively (visible through near-infrared). MERIS and OLCI imagery was used to identify long-wavelength spectral bands (from red through near-infrared portion of the spectrum) to locate algal blooms within freshwaters and estuaries of the continental United States. EnviroAtlas allows users to spatially explore this cyanobacteria data in the online interactive map viewer. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the continental United States.

             "description": "As included in this EnviroAtlas dataset, the community domestic water use was calculated using locally available water use data per capita in gallons of water per day (GPD), distributed dasymetrically, and summarized by census block group. Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Durham, NC, the Division of Water Resources (DWR), part of the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources (NCDENR), has made local water supply plans centrally available online. All local governments are required to provide public water service. Community water systems with 1,000+ service connections or 3,000+ residents are required to prepare a local water supply plan. These plans include residential, also known as domestic, water usage. To account for variations due to weather, a ten-year average was calculated for Durham, Hillsborough, and the Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA), which supplies southeast Orange County, including Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The ten-year average included available data between 2000 and 2010. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "description": "This map displays predicted probability of a 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC12) being at risk of violating the drinking water nitrate standard. Risk is defined as there being greater than a 50% chance of having a drinking water violation. Observed violations of the nitrate standard in public drinking water was used to make predictions across the conterminous United States. The data on nitrate violations comes from the EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) and the data used as predictor variables in the prediction models comes from EPA's StreamCat database. The original predictions were made at the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Catchment scale and summarized at the HUC12 scale and/or 300 m pixel scale. The maps show that 19% of the conterminous United States is at risk of groundwater sourced drinking violations, while 16% of the U.S. is at risk of nitrate violations from surface water sources. Regions with the highest risk of nitrate drinking violations from groundwater sources are found in the southwest, south central plains, parts of north west, mid-Atlantic. Surface water sourced nitrate violations have the greatest risk primarily in the southwest and south-central areas of the U.S. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset includes domestic water demand attributes which provide insight into the amount of water currently used for indoor and outdoor residential purposes in the contiguous United States. The values are based on 2010 water demand and 2010 population distribution, and have been summarized by subwatershed, or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12). For the purposes of this metric, domestic water use includes residential uses, such as for drinking, bathing, cleaning, landscaping, and pools. Depending on the location, domestic water can be self-supplied, such as by private wells, or publicly-supplied, such as by municipalities. Sources include surface water and groundwater. Estimates are for primary residences only (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Indices of Ecological Integrity of stream confluences for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains indices of ecological integrity in the upstream catchments and watersheds of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains polygons depicting the geographic areas of market-based programs, referred to herein as markets, and projects addressing ecosystem services protection in the United States. Depending upon the type of market or project and data availability, polygons reflect market coverage areas, project footprints, or project primary impact areas in which ecosystem service markets and projects operate. The data were collected via surveys and desk research conducted by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace from 2008 to 2016 on biodiversity (i.e., imperiled species/habitats; wetlands and streams), carbon, and water markets. Additional biodiversity data were obtained from the Regulatory In-lieu Fee and Bank Information Tracking System (RIBITS) database in 2015. Attribute data include information regarding the methodology, design, and development of biodiversity, carbon, and water markets and projects. This dataset was produced by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace for EnviroAtlas in order to support public access to and use of information related to environmental markets. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains polygons depicting the number of watershed-level market-based programs, referred to herein as markets, in operation per 8-digit HUC watershed throughout the United States. The data were collected via surveys and desk research conducted by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace during 2014 regarding markets operating to protect watershed ecosystem services. Utilizing these data, the number of water market coverage areas overlaying each HUC8 watershed were calculated to produce this dataset. Only water markets identified as operating at the watershed level (i.e., single or multiple watersheds define the market boundaries) were included in the count of water markets per HUC8 watershed. Excluded were water markets operating at the national, state, county, or federal lands level and all water projects. Attribute data include the watershed's 8-digit hydrologic unit code and name, in addition to the watershed-level water market count associated with the watershed. This dataset was produced by Forest Trends' Ecosystem Marketplace to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset shows the employment rate, or the percent of the population aged 16-64 who have worked in the past 12 months. The employment rate is a measure of the percent of the working-age population who are employed. It is an indicator of the prevalence of unemployment, which is often used to assess labor market conditions by economists. It is a widely used metric to evaluate the sustainable development of communities (NRC, 2011, UNECE, 2009). This dataset is based on the American Community Survey 5-year data for 2008-2012. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas web service includes maps that illustrate factors affecting transit accessibility, and indicators of accessibility. Accessibility measures how easily people can reach destinations such as their workplaces and can be measured in terms of both time and distance. It is affected by factors such as the proximity of housing to jobs, transit stops, stores, and services; the availability of various transit modes; and land use patterns. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "Understanding the relationship between flood inundation and floodplains is critical for ecosystem and community health and well-being, as well as targeting floodplain and riparian restoration. Many communities in the United States, particularly those in rural areas, lack inundation maps due to the high cost of flood modeling. Only 60% of the conterminous United States has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This EnviroAtlas dataset provides an estimate of the 100-year floodplain for the conterminous United States at 30-meter resolution to fill the gaps in the FIRM. The model hit rate for the CONUS was 0.79 compared to the FIRM, indicating that the model captured 79% of the 100-year floodplain identified by FEMA. This product provides complete coverage for the CONUS by identifying floodplains in areas without FIRMs, while also identifying floodplains in tributaries sometimes excluded by FEMA. More information can be found in the journal article (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.353). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Specific to Fresno, CA, urban water management plan data is available through the California Department of Water Resources (CADWR). Suppliers that provide over 3,000 acre-feet or serve more than 3,000 connections are required to evaluate future water supplies and implement plans to reduce 2010 baseline consumption by 20% by 2020. Within the EnviroAtlas Fresno study area, there are two service providers, City of Fresno and City of Clovis, with baseline 2010 water use estimates of 313 and 249 GPD respectively. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The air photos were United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) four band (red, green, blue, and near infrared) aerial photography at 1-m spatial resolution. Aerial photography ('imagery') was collected on multiple dates in summer 2010. Seven land cover classes were mapped: Water, impervious surfaces (Impervious), soil and barren (Soil), trees and forest (Tree), and grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation (Grass), agriculture (Ag), and Orchards. An accuracy assessment of 500 completely random and 103 stratified random points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 81.1 percent and a fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 86.9 (see below). The area mapped is defined by the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for Fresno, CA plus a 1-km buffer. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",
