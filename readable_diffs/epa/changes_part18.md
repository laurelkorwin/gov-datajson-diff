Age-adjusted mortality rates were weighted averages of the age-specific death rates, and they were used to account for different age structures among populations (Curtin and Klein 1995). The mortality rates for counties with < 10 deaths were suppressed by the CDC to protect privacy and to ensure data reliability; only counties with \u2265 10 deaths were included in the analyses. The underlying cause of mortality was specified using the World Health Organization\u2019s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th revision; ICD-10). In this study, we focused on the all-cause mortality rate (A00-R99) and on mortality rates from the three leading causes: heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20-I51), cancer (C00-C97), and stroke (I60- I69) (Heron 2013). We excluded mortality due to external causes for all-cause mortality, as has been done in many previous studies (e.g., Pearce et al. 2010, 2011; Zanobetti and Schwartz 2009), because external causes of mortality are less likely to be related to environmental quality. We also focused on the contiguous United States because the numbers of counties with available cause-specific mortality rates were small in Hawaii and Alaska. County-level rates were available for 3,101 of the 3,109 counties in the contiguous United States (99.7%) for all-cause mortality; for 3,067 (98.6%) counties for heart disease mortality; for 3,057 (98.3%) counties for cancer mortality; and for 2,847 (91.6%) counties for stroke mortality.

We set the cutoff between poor and fair condition as the 50th percentile model prediction. We examined sampler type, exposure, geographic zone of the AOC, and substrate type for confounding effects. Based on these analyses we combined data across sampler type and exposure classes and created separate models for each geographic zone. We used the resulting condition class cutoff values to assess the relative benthic condition for three habitat restoration project areas.

-            "description": "se of archival resources has been limited to date by inconsistent methods for genomic profiling of degraded RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. RNA-seq offers a novel way to address this problem. In this study we evaluated transcriptomic dose responses using RNA-seq in paired FFPE and frozen (FROZ) samples from two archival studies in mice, one recent (<2 years old) and the other older (>20 years old). Experimental treatments included di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) for the <2 and >20 year-old studies, respectively. Total RNA was ribodepleted and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In the recent study, FFPE samples showed high concordance in total reads (98% vs FROZ), fold-change values of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (R2 = 0.99), highly enriched target pathways (90% overlap with FROZ), and benchmark dose estimates for preselected target genes (-2% overall vs FROZ). In contrast, RNA-seq data from older FFPE samples had lower total reads (70% vs FROZ) and poor concordance in global DEGs and pathways. Despite a 99% loss of counts, dose responses were still evident for target genes in FFPE samples and positively correlated with paired FROZ samples. These findings highlight potential variability in the quality of RNA-seq data from FFPE samples. More recent FFPE samples were highly similar to FROZ samples in sequencing quality metrics, DEG profiles, and dose-response parameters, while further methods development is needed for older or lower-quality FFPE samples. This work should help broaden the use of archival resources in both chemical safety and translational science. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHester, S., V. Bhat, B.

RNA-seq offers a novel way to address this problem. In this study we evaluated transcriptomic dose responses using RNA-seq in paired FFPE and frozen (FROZ) samples from two archival studies in mice, one recent (<2 years old) and the other older (>20 years old). Experimental treatments included di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) for the <2 and >20 year-old studies, respectively. Total RNA was ribodepleted and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In the recent study, FFPE samples showed high concordance in total reads (98% vs FROZ), fold-change values of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (R2 = 0.99), highly enriched target pathways (90% overlap with FROZ), and benchmark dose estimates for preselected target genes (-2% overall vs FROZ). In contrast, RNA-seq data from older FFPE samples had lower total reads (70% vs FROZ) and poor concordance in global DEGs and pathways. Despite a 99% loss of counts, dose responses were still evident for target genes in FFPE samples and positively correlated with paired FROZ samples. These findings highlight potential variability in the quality of RNA-seq data from FFPE samples. More recent FFPE samples were highly similar to FROZ samples in sequencing quality metrics, DEG profiles, and dose-response parameters, while further methods development is needed for older or lower-quality FFPE samples. This work should help broaden the use of archival resources in both chemical safety and translational science. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nHester, S., V. Bhat, B.

Effects on cycloxygenase enzyme activity in ovary, prostaglandin F2alpha concentrations in plasma, 17beta-estradiol concentrations in plasma, and vitellogenin concentrations in plasma were measured. Gene expression in ovary samples was evaluated using a 15,000 probe oligonucleotide microarray. Transcriptomics data (raw data and normalized) are available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE72976. Metabolite profiles in liver tissue were measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition to these data, the data set also contains identification of differentially expressed genes, pathway enrichment and gene set enrichment analyes, ToxCast data for indomethacin and celecoxib, chemical-gene interaction data derived from the Comparative Toxicogenomics database, and results from Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 SeqAPASS analyses that examine conservation of target proteins across species (https://seqapass.epa.gov/seqapass/). \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMartinovic-Weigelt, D., A.

We show, using direct, speciated measurements of a suite of RO2 and gas-phase dimers from O3-initiated oxidation of \u03b1-pinene that ~150 gaseous dimers (C16-20H24-34O4-13) are primarily formed through RO2 cross-reactions, with a typical rate constant of 0.75-2\u00d710-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 and a lower-limit dimer formation branching ratio of 4%. These findings imply a gaseous dimer yield that varies strongly with nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, of at least 0.2-2.5% by mole (0.5-6.6% by mass) for conditions typical of forested regions with low to moderate anthropogenic influence (i.e., \u2264 50 ppt NO). Given their very low volatility, the gaseous C16-20 dimers provide a potentially important organic medium for initial particle formation, and alone can explain 5-60% of \u03b1-pinene secondary organic aerosol mass yields measured at atmospherically relevant particle mass loadings. The responses of RO2, dimers, and highly-oxygenated multifunctional compounds (HOM) to reacted \u03b1-pinene concentration and NO imply that an average ~20% of primary \u03b1-pinene RO2 from OH reaction and 10% from ozonolysis autoxidize at 3-10 s-1 and \u2265 1 s-1, respectively, confirming both oxidation pathways produce HOM efficiently, even at higher NO concentrations typical of urban areas. Thus, gas-phase dimer formation and RO2 autoxdiation are ubiquitous sources of low-volatility organic compounds capable of contributing significantly to atmospheric new particle formation and growth. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nZhao, Y., J.

We analyzed mRNA-sequencing data from exposed one-year-old needles. Our hypothesis is that 2-week chamber exposure to DECe would induce certain distinct transcriptome changes in the needles compared with responses to conventional diesel exhaust (DE) or filtered DECe Gas Phase. Blast2GO gene ontologies (GOs) enriched by significantly up-regulated DECe transcripts were nested within the GOs for DE, however, 93.5% of enriched GOs for significantly down-regulated DECe transcripts were unique. DECe attenuated expression of genes that affect functions of transferases, kinases, transmembrane transporters, transcription factors, diester hydrolases and RNA polymerase III; processes of protein phosphorylation, responses to stimuli, hormones and chemicals, carbohydrate transport, RNA polymerase III transcription, and cellular anion homeostasis; plus, components of the plasma membrane. MapMan analysis also identified RNA regulation of transcription, protein degradation, and lipid metabolism pathways that were enriched with DECe down-regulated transcripts. Divergent DECe treatment effects were associated with significantly elevated needle uptake of cerium. DE affected expression of more genes than DECe.

Twenty intact soil cores (5 cm diameter x 10 cm length) were collected from each turfgrass system in January and August 2016, respectively. For each turfgrass system, a total of 12 intact soil cores were used to measure N effluxes during three-week incubation, representing three replicates and four treatments: (1) no N input and 23 \u00b0C, (2) low N input (i.e., addition of 5.9 mg N as NH4NO3, equivalent to 30 kg N ha-1) and 23 \u00b0C, (3) high N input (i.e., addition of 11.8 mg N as NH4NO3, equivalent to 60 kg N ha-1) and 23 \u00b0C, and (4) high N input and 13 \u00b0C for winter samples (or 33 \u00b0C for summer samples). On day 0, water and NH4NO3 solution were added to the respective soil cores to bring soil moisture to 60% water filled pore space (WFPS). Here, we estimated soil bulk density and moisture content from the other eight intact soil cores and then calculated soil porosity assuming that soil particle density was 2.65 g cm-3. These soil cores were also used for soil pH measurement. \nSoil N2O and CO2 effluxes were measured almost daily via soil cores closed for 2 h and then 30-ml gas samples withdrawn from headspaces using gas-tight push button syringes with one-way luer stopcocks. On day 4, 11, and 18, roughly 80 ml leachate was collected from each soil core after 80 ml distilled water poured slowly to soil surface, drained up to 2 h, and then vacuum pumped out. Nitrous oxide was measured using a dual quantum cascade laser (QCL) N2O measurement system (Model CWQCL-200-D, Aerodyne, Billerica, MA, USA) (Chen et al., 2016). The efflux rate of N2O (\u00b5g m-2 h-1) was calculated as: ((Csample-Cair) \u00d7 M \u00d7 V) / (r \u00d7 m \u00d7 t), where Csample and Cair are the N2O concentrations in the headspace of intact soil core and ambient air (ppbv), respectively; V is the volume of intact soil core headspace (L); M is the molar mass of N2O (g mol-1); r is the molar volume at 1 atm (23.47 L mol-1 at 13 oC, 24.29 L mol-1 at 23 oC, and 25.11 L mol-1 at 33 oC), m is soil core surface area (m2), and t is the incubation time (h). \nThe QCL system also provided the mixing ratio of natural abundance of 15N in the center and edge position of N2O, i.e., 15N\u03b1 and 15N\u03b2, respectively. After normalized to total N2O-N concentration, these ratios were used to calculate the natural abundance of 15N\u03b1 and 15N\u03b2 of N2O. Then, 15N site preference was estimated by \u03b415N\u03b1 - \u03b415N\u03b2 and used to help probe the biological source of N2O efflux. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nChen, H., T.

Identifying regions of spatial overlap between high freshwater biodiversity value and elevated stress associated with non-native species can thus inform the determination of conservation priorities. Here we employ geospatial analysis of species distribution data at the watershed scale, extracted from publicly available databases, to investigate the potential threat of non-native species to vulnerable aquatic animal taxa across the continental United States. We mapped non-native aquatic plant and animal species richness and an index of cumulative invasion pressure, which weights non-native richness by time since introduction in order to estimate overall negative impact associated with species introductions. These distributions were compared to distributions of native aquatic animal taxa (fish, amphibians, mollusks, and decapods) derived from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) database. To identify hotspots of native biodiversity value we mapped overall species richness, proportion of species listed by IUCN as threatened and endangered, and a community index of species rarity calculated at the watershed scale. An overall priority index allowed identification of watersheds experiencing high pressure from non-native species and also exhibiting high native biodiversity conservation value. While these priority regions are roughly consistent with previously reported attempts to map biodiversity conservation needs across the US, we also recognize novel priority areas characterized by moderate-to-high native diversity but extremely high invasion pressure. We further explore the utility of this approach by comparing priority areas with existing conservation protections as well as projected future threats associated with land use change. Our findings suggest that many regions of elevated freshwater biodiversity value are compromised by high invasion pressure, and also may be poorly safeguarded by existing conservation mechanisms and likely to experience significant additional stresses in the future. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nPanlasigui, S., A.

To obtain a representative selection of relevant studies, we searched Web of Science\u2122 using a search string to target experimental studies in artificial and natural lotic systems while limiting irrelevant papers. We screened the titles and abstracts of returned papers for relevance (experimental studies in streams/stream mesocosms that manipulated nutrients). To supplement this search, we sorted the relevant articles from the Web of Science\u2122 search alphabetically by author and sequentially examined the bibliographies for additional relevant articles (screening titles for relevance, and then screening abstracts of potentially relevant articles) until we had obtained a total of 100 articles. If we could not find a relevant article electronically, we moved to the next article in the bibliography. Our goal was not to be completely comprehensive, but to obtain a fairly large sample of published, peer-reviewed studies from which to assess patterns. We excluded any lentic or estuarine studies from consideration and included only studies that used mesocosms mimicking stream systems (flowing water or stream water source) or that manipulated nutrient concentrations in natural streams or rivers. We excluded studies that used nutrient diffusing substrate (NDS) because these manipulate nutrients on substrates and not in the water column. We also excluded studies examining only nutrient uptake, which rely on measuring dissolved nutrient concentrations with the goal of characterizing in-stream processing (e.g., Newbold et al., 1983). From the included studies, we extracted or summarized the following information: study type, study duration, nutrient treatments, nutrients measured, inclusion of TN and/or TP response to nutrient additions, and a description of how results were reported in relation to the research-management mismatch, if it existed.

For lake and reservoir validation, two sets of temperature data were evaluated: land-water boundary (<59 m from shore) data and far shore (>180 m from shore) data. Estuary data were retained and evaluated only if they were >180 m from shore.

Biogenic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but the amounts and pathways of SOA generation from these precursors are not well constrained by observations. We propose that the less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) factor resolved from positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis on aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) data can be used as a surrogate for fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including lab-in-the-field perturbation experiments, extensive ambient ground-level measurements, and state-of-the-art modeling. We performed lab-in-the-field experiments in which the ambient air is perturbed by the injection of selected monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the subsequent SOA formation is investigated. PMF analysis on the perturbation experiments provides an objective link between LO-OOA and fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes as well as insights into the sources of other OA factors. Further, we use an upgraded atmospheric model and show that modeled SOA concentrations from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes could reproduce both the magnitude and diurnal variation of LO-OOA at multiple sites in the southeastern US, building confidence in our hypothesis. We estimate the annual average concentration of SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US to be roughly 2\u00b5gm\u22123.\n\nDataset (csv file) contains CMAQ model predictions for locations in the southeastern US during 2012 and 2013.

The rule sets a schedule for disinfection, flushing and coliform/E. coli sampling, in addition to instituting best practices and operator training.  In this study, a full scale reproduction of an aircraft drinking water system was constructed at the Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility in Cincinnati, OH.  The water system was conditioned using municipal tap water with a mixture of free chlorine and chloramines, and subsequently contaminated with coliforms.   Disinfection was undertaken using two common airline industry methods: chlorine dioxide at 100 mg/L (or higher) for two hours, and ozone at 1 mg/L (or higher) for 5 minutes. After disinfection, the water system was flushed until no disinfectant residual remained and then filled with treated municipal drinking water.  \n\nResults show that coliforms were not persistent on the aircraft plumbing surfaces, and no coliform positives were detected after disinfection and flushing.  The one exception was the aerator attached to the faucet typically installed in the lavatory, was positive for coliforms after disinfection. These data suggest that the faucet aerators could be a source of coliform contamination that may result in coliform positive samples taken under the ADWR.  Further experiments conducted on disinfection of aerators with glycolic acid and quaternary ammonia (both commonly used by the airlines) showed no detectable coliforms on coliform contaminated aerators after 30 minutes of soaking in the disinfectants.  However, many airlines disinfect aerators by the above methods or simply replace the aerators during each disinfection, effectively eliminating this potential source of coliform contamination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSzabo, J., M.

Animal models are the gold standard for identifying putative teratogens, but the limited throughput of developmental toxicological studies in animals coupled with the limited concordance between animal and human teratogenicity motivates a different approach. In vitro organoid models can mimic the cellular architecture and phenotype of many tissues and organs, and the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of organoids presents an opportunity to study developmental human toxicology. Common themes during development like the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tissue fusion present an opportunity to develop in vitro models to study cell and tissue morphogenesis. We previously described organoids composed of human stem and progenitor cells that recapitulated the cellular features of palate fusion, and here we further characterized the model by examining pharmacological inhibitors targeting known palatogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis pathways as well as twelve cleft palate teratogens identified from rodent models. Organoid survival was dependent on signaling through EGF, IGF, HGF, and FGF pathways, and organoid fusion was disrupted by inhibition of BMP signaling. We observed concordance between the effects of EGF, FGF, and BMP inhibitors on organoid fusion and epithelial cell migration in vitro, suggesting that organoid fusion is dependent on epithelial morphogenesis. Three of the twelve putative cleft palate teratogens studied here significantly disrupted in vitro fusion, including theophylline, triamcinolone, and valproic acid. Tributyltin chloride and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were cytotoxic to fusing organoids.  The study herein demonstrates the utility of the in vitro fusion assay for identifying chemicals that disrupt human organoid survival and morphogenesis in a scalable format amenable to toxicology screening. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBelair, D., C.

This data set includes forty-five PM2.5 filter samples that were collected in Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC, USA from June 1st to July 15th, 2013. The bulk carbonaceous components, including organic carbon, elemental carbon, water soluble organic carbon, and an array of organic molecular markers were measured; an ultraviolet (UV)/visible  (Vis) spectrometer was used to measure the light absorption of methanol and water extractable organic carbon. A complete description of how the data was acquired and and analyzed is provided in the manuscript.  A description of each parameter presented is provided in the file in the Data Dictionary. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nXie, M., X. Chen, A. Holder, M. Hays, M. Lewandowski, J. Offenberg, T. Kleindienst, and M. Jaoui. Summertime organic carbon absorption and sources at a southeastern U.S. location \u2013 dominance of secondary organic aerosol.

Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) have a long history of use in the assessment. However, FIB quantification provides no information about pollution sources. Microbial source tracking (MST) genetic markers have been developed in response to a need to identify pollution sources, yet factors that influence host-identifier target decay once discharged into the environment are often poorly understood, especially for agriculture fecal waste sources. Here, we investigate the influence of water type (freshwater versus marine) and select environmental parameters (indigenous microbiota, ambient sunlight) on the decay of FIB and MST genetic markers originating from cattle manure. Experiments were conducted in situ using a submersible aquatic mesocosm containing dialysis bags filled with a mixture of cattle manure and ambient water. Culturable FIB (E. coli and enterococci) were enumerated by membrane filtration and the concentration of general fecal indicator bacteria (GenBac3, Entero1a, and EC23S857) and MST (Rum2Bac, CowM2, and CowM3) genetic markers were estimated by qPCR. Water type was the most significant factor influencing the decay of cattle manure indicator bacteria (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.006 to < 0.001), although the magnitude of the effect differed among microbial targets and over time. The presence of indigenous microbiota and exposure to sunlight were both significantly correlated (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.044 to < 0.001) with decay of enterococci and CowM2, while E. coli, EC23S857, Rum2Bac, and CowM3 (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.044 <0.001) were significantly impacted by either sunlight or indigenous microbiota. Findings indicate the extended persistence (>144 hours) of both cultivated FIB and genetic markers in marine and freshwater water types. Findings suggest that multiple environmental stressors are important determinants of FIB and MST marker persistence, but their magnitude can vary across different indicators. Selective exclusion of natural aquatic microbiota and/or sunlight typically resulted in extended survival, but the effect was minor and limited to select microbial targets. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKorajkic, A., B.

-            "description": "The effect of acidity and relative humidity on bulk isoprene aerosol parameters has been investigated in several studies, however few measurements have been conducted on individual aerosol compounds. The focus of this study has been the examination of the effect of acidity and relative humidity on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemical composition from isoprene photooxidation in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NOx). A detailed characterization of SOA at the molecular level was also investigated. Experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in flow mode. Based on a detailed analysis of mass spectra obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of silylated derivatives in electron impact and chemical ionization modes, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry, and collision-induced dissociation in the negative ionization modes, we characterized not only typical isoprene products, but also new oxygenated compounds. A series of nitroxy-organosulfates (OS) were tentatively identified on the basis of high resolution mass spectra. Under acidic conditions, the major identified compounds include 2-methyltetrols (2MT), 2-methylglyceric acid (2MGA) and 2MT-OS. Other products identified include epoxydiols, mono- and dicarboxylic acids, other organic sulfates, and nitroxy- and nitrosoxy-OS. The contribution of SOA products from isoprene oxidation to PM2.5 was investigated by analysing ambient aerosol collected at rural sites in Poland. Methyltetrols, 2MGA and several organosulfates and nitroxy-OS were detected in both the field and laboratory samples. The influence of relative humidity on SOA formation was modest in non-acidic seed experiments, and stronger under acidic seed aerosol. Total secondary organic carbon decreased with increasing relative humidity under both acidic and non-acidic conditions. While the yields of some of the specific organic compounds decreased with increasing relative humidity others varied in an indeterminate manner from changes in the relative humidity. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nNestorowicz, K., M.

-            "description": "Biochar is being evaluated as an amendment to improve soil characteristics to increase crop yields, revitalize degraded soils and facilitate the establishment of plant cover. Unfortunately, there are few rapid tests to determine potential effects of biochar on soil and associated plant responses. Seed germination (emergence of hypocotyl) is a critical parameter for plant establishment and may be a rapid indicator of biochar effects. We adapted Oregon State University Seed Laboratory procedures to develop a \u201crapid-test\u201d to screen for effects of biochar on seed germination and soil characteristics. Soils were amended with 1% biochar by weight and placed in 11.0 cm square x 3.5 cm deep containers fitted with premoistened blotter paper. Seeds were placed in a uniform 5 x 5 pattern and covered with 15 g of the soil-biochar mixtures. Two South Carolina Coastal Plain soils, the Norfolk (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults) and Coxville (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Paleaquults), were used. Eighteen biochars were evaluated produced from 6 feedstocks [pine chips (PC), poultry litter (PL), swine solids (SS), switchgrass (SG); and two blends of PC and PL, 50% PC/50% PL (55), and 80% PC/20% PL (82).  For each feedstock biochars were made by pyrolysis at 350, 500 and 700\u00b0C for 1-2 hours.  Percent germination and shoot dry weight were evaluated for cabbage, carrot, cucumber, lettuce, oat, onion, perennial ryegrass and tomato. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and extractable phosphorus (EP), factors which can affect seed germination and early seedling growth, were determined after plant harvests.  Germination primarily was affected by soil type with few biochar effects. Shoot dry weight was increased for carrot, lettuce, oat and tomato; primarily with biochars containing PL. Soil pH and EC increased with PL, SS, 55 and most 82 treatments across soil types and plant species.  Soil EP increased substantially with SS and PL and to a lesser extent with 55 and 82 for both soils across species, and with SG pyrolyzed at 550 and 750\u00b0C soil for the Norfolk soil across species.  Thus, this rapid-test method can be an early indicator of the effects of biochar on seed germination and important soil health characteristics which can be affected by biochar and effect seed germination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nOlszyk, D.M., T.

Unfortunately, there are few rapid tests to determine potential effects of biochar on soil and associated plant responses. Seed germination (emergence of hypocotyl) is a critical parameter for plant establishment and may be a rapid indicator of biochar effects. We adapted Oregon State University Seed Laboratory procedures to develop a \u201crapid-test\u201d to screen for effects of biochar on seed germination and soil characteristics. Soils were amended with 1% biochar by weight and placed in 11.0 cm square x 3.5 cm deep containers fitted with premoistened blotter paper. Seeds were placed in a uniform 5 x 5 pattern and covered with 15 g of the soil-biochar mixtures. Two South Carolina Coastal Plain soils, the Norfolk (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults) and Coxville (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Paleaquults), were used. Eighteen biochars were evaluated produced from 6 feedstocks [pine chips (PC), poultry litter (PL), swine solids (SS), switchgrass (SG); and two blends of PC and PL, 50% PC/50% PL (55), and 80% PC/20% PL (82).  For each feedstock biochars were made by pyrolysis at 350, 500 and 700\u00b0C for 1-2 hours.  Percent germination and shoot dry weight were evaluated for cabbage, carrot, cucumber, lettuce, oat, onion, perennial ryegrass and tomato. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and extractable phosphorus (EP), factors which can affect seed germination and early seedling growth, were determined after plant harvests.  Germination primarily was affected by soil type with few biochar effects. Shoot dry weight was increased for carrot, lettuce, oat and tomato; primarily with biochars containing PL. Soil pH and EC increased with PL, SS, 55 and most 82 treatments across soil types and plant species.  Soil EP increased substantially with SS and PL and to a lesser extent with 55 and 82 for both soils across species, and with SG pyrolyzed at 550 and 750\u00b0C soil for the Norfolk soil across species.  Thus, this rapid-test method can be an early indicator of the effects of biochar on seed germination and important soil health characteristics which can be affected by biochar and effect seed germination. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nOlszyk, D.M., T.

Such information is useful for making site management decisions.  We investigate the use of historic data collected during long-term monitoring (LTM) activities at a site in Rhode Island to predict the SSF based on temporal mass discharge measurements at a fixed location, as well as SSF estimation using mass discharge measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes.  Mass discharge based on LTM data decreased from ~300 g/day in 1996 to ~70 g/day in 2012 at a control plane downgradient of the suspected DNAPL source zone, and indicates an overall decline of ~80% in 16 years.  These measurements were compared to current mass discharge measurements across three spatially distributed control planes.  Results indicate that mass discharge increased in the downgradient direction, and was ~6 g/day, ~37 g/day, and ~400 g/day at near, intermediate, and far distances from the suspected source zone, respectively.  This behavior was expected given the decreasing trend observed in the LTM data at a fixed location.  These two data sets were compared using travel time as a means to plot the data sets on a common axis.

However, the effectiveness of diatoms as indicators may suffer if inconsistent taxon identifications across different analysts obscure the relationships between assemblage composition and environmental variables. To reduce these inconsistencies, we harmonized the 2008\u20132009 NRSA data from nine analysts by updating names to current synonyms and by statistically identifying taxa with high analyst signal (taxa with more variation in relative abundance explained by the analyst factor, relative to environmental variables). We then screened a subset of samples with QA/QC data and combined taxa with mismatching identifications by the primary and secondary analysts. When these combined \u201cslash groups\u201d did not reduce analyst signal, we elevated taxa to the genus level or omitted taxa in difficult species complexes. We examined the variation explained by analyst in the original and revised datasets. Further, we examined how revising the datasets to reduce analyst signal can reduce inconsistency, thereby uncovering the variation in assemblage composition explained by total phosphorus (TP), an environmental variable of high priority for water managers. To produce a revised dataset with the greatest taxonomic consistency, we ultimately made 124 slash groups, omitted 7 taxa in the small naviculoid (e.g., Sellaphora atomoides) species complex, and elevated Nitzschia, Diploneis, and Tryblionella taxa to the genus level. Relative to the original dataset, the revised dataset had more overlap among samples grouped by analyst in ordination space, less variation explained by the analyst factor, and more than double the variation in assemblage composition explained by TP. Elevating all taxa to the genus level did not eliminate analyst signal completely, and analyst remained the most important predictor for the genera Sellaphora, Mayamaea, and Psammodictyon, indicating that these taxa present the greatest obstacle to consistent identification in this dataset. Although our process did not completely remove analyst signal, this work provides a method to minimize analyst signal and improve detection of diatom association with TP in large datasets involving multiple analysts. Examination of variation in assemblage data explained by analyst and taxonomic harmonization may be necessary steps for improving data quality and the utility of diatoms as indicators of environmental variables. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nLee, S., I.

However, the effectiveness of diatoms as indicators may suffer if inconsistent taxon identifications across different analysts obscure the relationships between assemblage composition and environmental variables. To reduce these inconsistencies, we harmonized the 2008\u20132009 NRSA data from nine analysts by updating names to current synonyms and by statistically identifying taxa with high analyst signal (taxa with more variation in relative abundance explained by the analyst factor, relative to environmental variables). We then screened a subset of samples with QA/QC data and combined taxa with mismatching identifications by the primary and secondary analysts. When these combined \u201cslash groups\u201d did not reduce analyst signal, we elevated taxa to the genus level or omitted taxa in difficult species complexes. We examined the variation explained by analyst in the original and revised datasets. Further, we examined how revising the datasets to reduce analyst signal can reduce inconsistency, thereby uncovering the variation in assemblage composition explained by total phosphorus (TP), an environmental variable of high priority for water managers. To produce a revised dataset with the greatest taxonomic consistency, we ultimately made 124 slash groups, omitted 7 taxa in the small naviculoid (e.g., Sellaphora atomoides) species complex, and elevated Nitzschia, Diploneis, and Tryblionella taxa to the genus level.

-            "description": "Cleft palate (CP) is a common birth defect, occurring in an estimated 1 in 1000 births worldwide. The secondary palate is formed by paired palatal shelves that grow toward each other, appose, attach and fuse. CP can result from disruption of any of these processes. The palatal shelves basically consist of a mesenchymal tissue core covered with a layer of epithelial cells. One of the mechanisms that can cause CP is failure of fusion, i.e., failure to remove the epithelial seam between the palatal shelves to allow the mesenchyme to merge and form a continuous palate. This process requires complex interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells, and signaling components such as growth factors. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in palate growth and differentiation, while it may impede fusion. We developed a 3D organotypic model using human mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells to mimic human embryonic palatal shelves, and tested its functional relevance by monitoring the effects of human EGF (hEGF) on proliferation and fusion. Spheroids were generated from human umbilical-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) directed down an osteogenic lineage by culture medium and evaluated for osteogenic differentiation. Heterotypic spheroids, or organoids, were constructed by coating hMSC spheroids with MaxGel\u2122 extracellular matrix solution followed by a layer of human progenitor epithelial keratinocytes (hPEK). Organoids were incubated in co-culture medium with or without hEGF and assessed for cell proliferation and spheroid pairs were assessed for time to fusion. Osteogenic differentiation in hMSC spheroids was highest by day 13. hEGF delayed fusion of heterotypic organoids after 12 and 18 hours of contact.  hEGF increased proliferation in organoids at 4 ng/ml, and proliferation was detected in hPEKs alone on microcarrier beads, suggesting a potential mechanism for delayed fusion by hEGF. Our results show that this model of human palatal fusion consisting of a core of differentiated hMSCs with a hPEK outer layer appropriately mimics the morphology of the developing human palate and responds to hEGF as expected. Future studies will focus on using the organoid model to evaluate the effects of teratogenic chemicals on palatal fusion, and validating the results. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nWolf, C., D.
