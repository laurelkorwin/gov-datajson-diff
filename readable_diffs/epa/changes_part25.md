+            "description": "These datasets contain results of sediment and contaminant transport (arsenic) simulation for 100-year flood in Woodbridge watershed, NJ. The flood discharge is simulated by HEC-HMS model using 24-hours storm and runoff curve number method. HEC-RAS 2D is used to simulate flood with 48-hours duration. The External Coupler program links HEC-RAS 2D and WASP in an offline and one-way direction. The Coupler is developed in python. The source code, executable file, and users\u2019 manual for the program are available in the External Coupler folder. Using hydrodynamic file generated by the External Coupler, WASP simulated sediment and contaminant transport in flood. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nShabani, A., S. Woznicki, M. Mehaffey, J. Butcher, T. Wool, and P. Whung. A coupled hydrodynamic (HEC-RAS 2D) and water quality model (WASP) for simulating flood-induced soil, sediment, and contaminant transport.   Journal of Flood Risk Management. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, USA, 14(4): e12747, (2021).",

These include a flat and hierarchical structure of the five balancing criteria, shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. Table 4 provides a comprehensive score for each balancing criterion, similar to the summary tables presented in the FS of Superfund sites (e.g., (EPA 2016b, AECOM 2019)). Table 5 uses the same information in Table 3, but in this case, each piece of information is used to define multiple sub-criteria for each balancing criterion, except the cost one. This leads to a much more elaborate information table with the four remaining balancing criteria, now characterized by 13 sub-criteria. \n\nIt is important to note that the scoring provided in Table 4 and Table 5, with the exception of the cost (c_5), were derived from the author\u2019s interpretation of the descriptive language of the detailed analysis in for the hypothetical case study in presented in Table A-7 in Appendix A of the guidance document of EPA (1988b). It should be noted that the analysis of the three remedy alternatives presented in this hypothetical case study is governed by site-specific characteristics and may not represent potential performance of these remediation alternatives for other sites .  The intent of this exercise is to illustrate the flexibility and adaptability of the MCDA process to address both the main, overarching criteria, as well as sub-criteria that may have specific importance in the decision process for a particular site.  Ultimately, the sub-criteria can be adapted to address specific stakeholder perspectives or technical factors that may be linked to properties unique to the contaminant or physical characteristics of the site. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nCinelli, M., M.A. Gonzalez, R.

Since digester effluents are used as for cropland applications, we are interested to find out whether the quality of these organic fertilizers are impacted by the AD process. In addition, few studies have investigated the performance of AD in field conditions. In this study, we monitored the performance of three operational AD systems for two years. These three systems have different retention times (9, 12 and 34 days), that is how long the waste materials stay in the digester. We collected influent and effluent samples every two months and analyzed for pH, nutrients and metals. We found that the two shorter retention systems slightly decreased effluent pH while the long retention system significantly increased the effluent pH, i.e., by 1.8 unit. The 34-day retention system also removed more solids and increased ammonium-nitrogen in the effluent. We found no significant changes in the metals that we analyzed. These findings can assist in developing strategies for cleaner production using AD in an environmentally sustainable manner. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nZhang, X., I.

Public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90% of the United States population. Cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences. Satellite imagery can serve as a cost-effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems. This study uses satellite imagery from the European Space Agency\u2019s Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) spanning June 2016 through April 2020. At 300-m spatial resolution, OLCI imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states. First, a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of 99 responses submitted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s fourth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 4). These UCMR 4 quantitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from March 2018 through November 2019. Overall agreement between satellite imagery and UCMR 4 qualitative responses was high at over 94% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. Next, temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed. In 2019, bloom frequency averaged 2% and peaked at 100%, where 100% indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available. Monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short-term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources. Generally, 2016-2020 was an insufficient time period for observing changes at these source waters; On average, a decade of data would be required for observed trends to outweigh variability in the data. However, five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short-term trend, with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from June 2016 to April 2020 and four decreasing.

The selected chemicals exhibited estrogenic or androgenic bioactivity in high throughput screening data obtained from US EPA ToxCast models. Xenopus laevis larvae were exposed nominally to each chemical at 3.6, 10.9, 33.0 and 100 \u00b5g/L, except 4-NP for which concentrations were 1.8, 5.5, 16.5 and 50 \u00b5g/L. Endpoint data (daily or given study day (SD)) collected included:  mortality (daily), developmental stage (SD 7 and 21), hind limb length (HLL) (SD 7 and 21), snout-vent length (SVL) (SD 7 and 21), wet body weight (BW) (SD 7 and 21), and thyroid histopathology (SD 21). 4-OP and BBP caused accelerated development compared to controls at the mean measured concentration of 39.8 and 3.5 \u00b5g/L, respectively. Normalized HLL was increased on SD 21 for all chemicals except 4-NP. Histopathology revealed mild thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy at all BBP concentrations, while moderate thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy occurred at the 105 \u00b5g /L BBP concentration. Evidence of accelerated metamorphic development was also observed histopathologically in BBP-treated frogs at concentrations as low as 3.5 \u00b5g/L. Increased BW relative to control occurred for all chemicals except 4-OP. Increase in SVL was observed in larvae exposed to 4-NP, BBP and DBP on SD 21.  With the exception of 4-NP, four of the chemicals tested appeared to alter thyroid axis-driven metamorphosis, albeit through different lines of evidence, with BBP and DBP providing the strongest evidence of effects on the thyroid axis.

Here we collated five datasets of lake sediment diatoms from the northeastern USA using a harmonization process which included updating synonyms, tracking the identity of inconsistently identified taxa and grouping those that could not be resolved taxonomically. The Dataset consists of a Portable Document Format (.pdf) file of the Voucher Flora, six Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) data files, an R script, and five output Comma Separated Values (.csv) files. \n\nThe Voucher Flora documents the morphological species concepts in the dataset using diatom images compiled into plates (NE_Lakes_Voucher_Flora_102421.pdf) and the translation scheme of the OTU codes to diatom scientific or provisional names with identification sources, references, and notes (VoucherFloraTranslation_102421.xlsx).\n\nThe file Slide_accession_numbers_102421.xlsx has slide accession numbers in the ANS Diatom Herbarium.\n\nThe \u201cDiatomHarmonization_032222_files for R.zip\u201d archive contains four Excel input data files, the R code, and a subfolder \u201cOUTPUT\u201d with five .csv files. The file Counts_original_long_102421.xlsx contains original diatom count data in long format. The file Harmonization_102421.xlsx is the taxonomic harmonization scheme with notes and references. The file SiteInfo_031922.xlsx contains sampling site- and sample-level information. WaterQualityData_021822.xlsx is a supplementary file with water quality data. R code (DiatomHarmonization_032222.R) was used to apply the harmonization scheme to the original diatom counts to produce the output files. The resulting output files are five wide format files containing diatom count data at different harmonization steps (Counts_1327_wide.csv, Step1_1327_wide.csv, Step2_1327_wide.csv, Step3_1327_wide.csv) and the summary of the Indicator Species Analysis (INDVAL_RESULT.csv). The harmonization scheme (Harmonization_102421.xlsx) can be further modified based on additional taxonomic investigations, while the associated R code (DiatomHarmonization_032222.R) provides a straightforward mechanism to diatom data versioning. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nPotapova, M., S.

The first phase involved sorption experiments for six selected PFAS compounds diluted in a water solution, using five selected sorbents: granular activated carbon (GAC), activated carbon-clay blend, modified clay, biochar, iron (Fe)-amended biochar, and Ottawa sand as a control media. The second phase involved chemical stabilization treatment (via sorption), using the most effective sorbent identified in the first phase, followed by solidification of two soils from PFAS-contaminated sites. Physical solidification was achieved by adding cement as a binding agent. Results from the first phase (sorption experiments) indicated that GAC was slightly more successful than the other sorbents in sorption performance for a 3,000 \u00b5g/L solution containing a mixture of the six selected PFAS analytes (500 \u00b5g/L concentration each of shorter- and longer-chain alkyl acids), and was the only sorbent used in the second phase of this study. While the GAC, activated carbon-clay blend, and modified clay sorbents showed similar sorption performance for the longer chain analytes tested, both the activated carbon-clay blend and modified clay, exhibited slightly less sorptive capacity than GAC for the shorter-chain alkyl acids.   Immobilization effectiveness was evaluated by soil leachability testing using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1312, Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) on the samples collected from two PFAS-contaminated sites.  For the majority of the PFAS soil analytes, the addition of GAC sorbent (chemical stabilization) substantially reduced the leachability of PFAS compounds from the contaminated soil samples, and the addition of cement as a physical binding agent (solidification) further decreased leachability for a few of the PFAS compounds. Overall immobilization of PFAS analytes that were detectable in the leachate from two PFAS contaminated soils ranged from 87.1% to 99.9%. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that the laboratory testing results presented here may have application to further pilot or limited field-scale studies within a broader suite of PFAS-contaminated site treatment options that are currently available for treating PFAS contaminated soils. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nBarth, E., J.

We present chamber-based measurements of the speciated gas and particle phases during photochemical oxidation of \u03943-carene. We find evidence of highly oxidized organic molecules (HOM) in the gas phase and relatively low volatility SOA dominated by C7-C10 species. We then use computational methods to develop the first stages of a \u03943-carene photochemical oxidation mechanism and explain some of our measured compositions. We find that alkoxy bond scission of the cyclohexyl ring likely leads to efficient HOM formation, in line with previous studies. We also find a surprising role for the abstraction of primary hydrogens from methyl groups, which has been calculated to be rapid in the \u03b1-pinene system, and suggest more research is required to determine if this is more general to other systems and a feature of autoxidation. This work develops a more comprehensive view of \u03943-carene photochemical oxidation products via measurements and lays out a suggested mechanism of oxidation via computationally derived rate coefficients.

VTG has been measured by a variety of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Recently, an ELISA targeting VTG from a variety of environmentally or regulatory relevant fish species was developed which detects VTG in serum, plasma, whole tissue homogenate and outer mucus coat (TECO Medical Group, Switzerland). Detection of VTG in mucus presents a non-invasive method of monitoring endocrine disruption. As the scientific community strives to reduce animal testing, this method could provide a reliable, minimally invasive sample for routine monitoring studies. The objective of this study was to characterize VTG  protein in male fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) mucus compared with more conventional measures in plasma and mRNA isolated from liver. VTG expression changes have frequently been studied in fathead minnows exposed to the well-characterized endocrine disrupting compound, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2). To assess the intensity and duration of changes in mucus VTG concentrations, fathead minnows were exposed to EE2 for 7 days with a subsequent depuration period of 14 days. The exposure was conducted in a flow-through system to maintain a consistent concentration of EE2 at a nominal EC50 concentration of 2.5 ng/L and high concentration of 10 ng/L as a positive control. Mucus, plasma and liver were sampled at regular intervals throughout the study. Relative abundance of vtg mRNA  increased after 2 days of exposure and disappeared after 4 days of depuration. Vitellogenin protein expression increased after 2 days of exposure and remained elevated throughout the depuration period. The pattern of protein expression in mucus was the same as plasma indicating mucus can be used as a non-invasive sample for measuring VTG in fish. Sampling mucus allows researchers to collect more samples in less time during one sampling event without sacrificing animals. Additionally, the same population may be repeatedly sampled, which is potentially useful to monitor remediation efforts or for endangered species. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSee, M.J., D.

The dataset consists of four input data tables (Appendices A1-A4) for a Lake Superior EcoPath with EcoSim (EwE; http://ecopath.org) model parameterized to the early 21st century using 2001-2016 collections. The data presented here are primarily intended to development a static ecosystem model representing a snapshot of Lake Superior circa 2005 when the bulk of information was collected. Input data were compiled from multiple federal, state, provincial, and tribal agencies, academic institutions, published reports, theses, and peer review journal articles. This dataset includes results from lake-wide Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative surveys (CSMI; CSMI 2020) of Lake Superior undertaken in 2005-06, 2011 and 2016. We provide results of three lake-wide acoustic surveys (2003-2006, 2011 and 2016) that provided biomass estimates (kg/ha) of pelagic prey (cisco, bloater, kiyi and rainbow smelt); the later two (2011 and 2016) were part of the larger CSMI efforts. Our inputs on fish rely heavily on data included in Isaac (2010) who used USGS bottom trawl samples. These trawl data had been included in a previously released data set (Great Lakes Science Center 2019). We include these samples in the current release because we made a QA/QC effort to verify that the results of Isaac (2010) could be reproduced. We found that biomass estimates were close to that reported by Isaac (2010) for most groups (see associated metadata record process step 8 for details), but not exact. We opted to use biomass estimates as reported in Isaac (2010) for four species because his production to biomass (P/B) we\u2019re using in the EcoPath model are explicitly linked to the biomass estimates provided by Isaac (2010). Collectively, these data represent the best available estimates of lake-wide population characteristics (biomass, production, consumption, diet, harvest, etc.) across trophic levels from bacteria to sea lamprey. Readers interested in learning more details about this data compilation and balancing of this Lake Superior ecosystem model should read the associated manuscript (Matthias, et al.), which is noted in the metadata cross reference section. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMatthias, B., T.

While endpoints in these tests (survival, growth and reproduction) are conceptually related, because they are measured in separate exposures, the quantitative relationships between them are difficult to determine and largely ignored.  In the current test, fathead minnows (FHM) were exposed for 28 days to 1 mg/L or 2 mg/L carbaryl, a well-studied carbamate insecticide, in early life stages and then reared in clean water until adulthood, when reproduction was assessed.  Also. weekly growth measurements were taken throughout the test to determine growth rates during and after exposure.  Growth curves derived from these measurements were then compared to the reproductive output.  The data indicate that carbaryl reduced growth rate only for a brief time early in the exposure.  However, this brief effect impacted overall growth into adulthood and lowered the reproductive output of exposed FHM.  The effect of a transient exposure early in life to carbaryl could have later population-level impacts by causing mortality, lowering growth rates, and reducing reproductive output. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFlynn, K., S.

To investigate this issue, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with\nthe U. S.

Comparisons of nvPM particle mass (i.e., black carbon), number, and\nsize were conducted in both campaigns. Additionally, the sensitivity to variation in system\noperational parameters was evaluated in VARIAnT 1.

However, long-term data sets for benthic invertebrate assemblages across broad geographic areas are rare and, even if collected, historic data sets are often not readily accessible. This data set provides densities of benthic macroinvertebrates for all taxa collected during lake-wide surveys in Lake Ontario, a Laurentian Great Lake, from 1964 to 2018. This information resulted from surveys funded by the governments of the United States and Canada to investigate the status and changes of Lake Ontario benthic community. Of the 13 lake-wide benthic surveys conducted in Lake Ontario over the course of 54\u2009yr, we were able to acquire taxonomic data to the species level for 11 of the surveys and data to the group level for the other two surveys. Density data are provided for taxa representing the Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Nemertea, and Platyhelminthes phyla. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the compositional structure of Lake Ontario invertebrate assemblages differed markedly by depth and were also significantly altered by the Dreissena spp. invasion in early 1990s. The introduction of invasive dreissenids has changed the community historically dominated by Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae, to a community dominated by quagga mussels and Oligochaeta. Considering the rarity of long-term benthic data of high taxonomic resolution in lake ecosystems, this data set could be useful to explore broader aspects of ecological theory, including effects of different environmental factors and invasive species on community organization, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and spatial scale of variation in community structure. The data set could also be useful for studies on individual species including abundance and distribution, species co-occurrence, and how the patterns of dominance and rarity change over space and time. Use of this data set for academic or educational purposes is encouraged as long as the data source is properly cited using the title of this Data Paper, the names of the authors, the year of publication, the journal name, and the article number. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nKaratayev, A., L.

Hines, Suzanne E. Fenton. (2021) Current breast milk PFAS levels in the US and Canada: After all this time why don\u2019t we know more?\n\nTo estimate nationally representative breast milk concentrations for the US and Canada, we used serum PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA data from the NHANES and the Canadian Health Measures Survey, respectively. To estimate milk concentrations in communities with a known history of PFAS drinking water contamination, geometric mean serum concentrations measured as part of the ATSDR PFAS Exposure Assessments (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments.html) were used.

Hines, Suzanne E. Fenton. (2021) Current breast milk PFAS levels in the US and Canada: After all this time why don\u2019t we know more?\n\nTo estimate nationally representative breast milk concentrations for the US and Canada, we used serum PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA data from the NHANES and the Canadian Health Measures Survey, respectively. To estimate milk concentrations in communities with a known history of PFAS drinking water contamination, geometric mean serum concentrations measured as part of the ATSDR PFAS Exposure Assessments (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/activities/assessments.html) were used. We also used publicly available data from the New York State Department of Health for information on the Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh areas. In Table 1.

MICP has been widely studied as a biotechnology for use in strengthening soils, impacting permeability of porous media and fractures, and mitigating fugitive dust emissions, among other applications.  This technology has also been explored for remediation applications, including co-precipitation of radionuclides in contaminated groundwater as well as stabilization of mine waste and fly ash.  In this study, we utilize a native bacterial enrichment to promote MICP on seven mine waste samples with variability in acid production and extent of toxic metal leaching.  Over the course of fifteen applications of MICP solutions and bacteria on the surface of waste rock in bench-scale columns, calcium carbonate mineral formed on grain surfaces within the waste samples and the effluent from acid-producing wastes increased in pH during MICP treatment. The performance of MICP was evaluated with humidity cell and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) tests. Humidity cell and SPLP leaching tests revealed reductions in Cd, Pb and Zn in leachate of almost all samples, mixed results for Cu, and As increasing in most leachate samples after treatment. While reduction in metals leaching varied between different waste rock samples, MICP-driven formation of calcium carbonate was observed in all mine waste samples by the end of treatment. While the distribution of CaCO3 coating was uneven in microscopic images, the technology has potential for coating solid mine waste and reducing release of acid and some metals.

-            "description": "Concentrations alone do not provide answer to the question about how emissions are changing over the surface, in part due to simultaneous changes in transport, emissions, dynamics, photochemistry, and chemical feedback. Therefore simulating a chemical transport model benefiting from a multi-specie inversion framework using well-characterized observations should differentiate those influences enabling to closely focus on the emission part. This has another advantage in that we can, to a certain extent, disentangle the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation of ozone. Accordingly, we jointly constrain NOx and VOC emissions using well-characterized TROPOMI HCHO and NO2 columns during individual months of March, April, and May 2020 (lockdown) and 2019 (baseline). We observe a noticeable decline in the magnitude of NOx emissions in March (14-31%) in several major cities such as Paris, Madrid, and Milan expanding further to Rome, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Warsaw, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Moscow (34-51%) in April. A large variability associated with changes in NOx emissions is indicative of varying dates and the degree of restrictions enacted to prevent the spread of the virus. For instance, NOx emissions remain in somewhat similar values or even higher in northern Germany and Moscow in March 2020 compared to the baseline. Comparisons against surface monitoring stations indicate that the model estimate of the NO2 reduction is underestimated, a picture that correlates with the number of TROPOMI samples impacted by cloudiness. During the month of April, when ample TROPOMI samples are present, the surface NO2 reductions occurring in polluted areas are described fairly well by the model (model: -21\u00b117%, observation: -29\u00b121%). Changes in VOC emissions are dominantly influenced by eastern European biomass burning activities and biogenic isoprene emissions. In March, however, TROPOMI HCHO sets an upper limit for HCHO changes such that the chemical feedback of NOx on HCHO constrained by TROPOMI NO2 reveals a non-negligible decline in anthropogenic VOC emissions in Paris, Milan, London, and Rome. This striking result is only achievable by jointly incorporating HCHO and NO2 observations into the inversion context. Results support an increase in surface ozone during the lockdown. In April, the constrained model features a reasonable agreement with maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone changes observed at the surface (r=0.43), specifically over central Europe where ozone enhancements prevail (model: +3.73\u00b13.94%, +1.79 ppbv, observation: +7.85\u00b111.27%, +3.76 ppbv).

+            "description": "Concentrations alone do not provide answer to the question about how emissions are changing over the surface, in part due to simultaneous changes in transport, emissions, dynamics, photochemistry, and chemical feedback. Therefore simulating a chemical transport model benefiting from a multi-specie inversion framework using well-characterized observations should differentiate those influences enabling to closely focus on the emission part. This has another advantage in that we can, to a certain extent, disentangle the chemical and physical processes involved in the formation of ozone. Accordingly, we jointly constrain NOx and VOC emissions using well-characterized TROPOMI HCHO and NO2 columns during individual months of March, April, and May 2020 (lockdown) and 2019 (baseline). We observe a noticeable decline in the magnitude of NOx emissions in March (14-31%) in several major cities such as Paris, Madrid, and Milan expanding further to Rome, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Warsaw, Belgrade, Kyiv, and Moscow (34-51%) in April. A large variability associated with changes in NOx emissions is indicative of varying dates and the degree of restrictions enacted to prevent the spread of the virus. For instance, NOx emissions remain in somewhat similar values or even higher in northern Germany and Moscow in March 2020 compared to the baseline. Comparisons against surface monitoring stations indicate that the model estimate of the NO2 reduction is underestimated, a picture that correlates with the number of TROPOMI samples impacted by cloudiness.

The field experiment was established in June 2016 with the uniform planting of a sweet corn crop across the whole ~2 ac site. In September 2016, monitoring networks were installed in two subfields, North and South, consisting of groundwater wells and vadose zone instrumentation installed near the center of each. Water was sampled every two weeks beginning in October 2016 and analyzed for a suite of nutrients and stable isotopes. We present four years of such nutrient data, along with post-harvest soil data, collected each September after plant harvest.
