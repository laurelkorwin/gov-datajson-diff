Therefore, more detailed, site-specific analysis is necessary to identify or prioritize the best sites for developing renewable energy facilities based on the technical and economic potential.

The Docket contains information reported to EPA by federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants have been or may be released. The Docket serves three major purposes:\n1. To identify all federal facilities that must be evaluated through the site assessment process to determine whether they pose a risk to human health and the environment sufficient to warrant inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL); \n2. To compile and maintain the information submitted to EPA on such facilities under the provisions listed in section 120(c) of CERCLA; and\n3. To provide a mechanism to make the information available to the public.\nThe docket includes facilities which have provided information to EPA through documents such as reports under a Federal agency environmental restoration program, regardless of the absence of section 103 reporting. E-Docket is an internal business management tool that will improve the tracking and record keeping of information about facilities that have been identified as potential Docket sites. The functionality of the system is basic record tracking, and it will contain a list of draft proposed facilities which can be sorted based on Agency ownership, region, or status (Draft Proposed, Proposed, Added, or Not Added). The information compiled in the tool is publicly available. \nThe data asset also includes the FFRRO Regional Work Planning Application, which is a tool for the Superfund Federal Facilities Response Program.

             "description": "The Trace Atmospheric Gas Analyzer (TAGA) buses are self-contained mobile laboratories that conduct instant-result monitoring of air quality at particular locations. From May 18-June 6, 2010, EPA\u2019s TAGA buses monitored for the two chemicals found in the COREXIT dispersants that have the highest potential to get into the air in any significant amounts: EGBE (2-butoxyethanol) and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether. In addition to being found in the COREXIT dispersants, these compounds are found in cleaning products and coatings. As a result, we have not beeen able to identify the source of the measured compounds. The TAGA buses detected very low levels of these chemicals in the air, at a limited number of the locations sampled along the Gulf Coast. The levels found were well below those that are likely to cause health effects, and suggest that the use of dispersants on the oil spill would not have a significant impact on air quality on land.",

Affected facilities are to develop risk management programs which will prevent and minimize consequences of accidental releases of certain hazardous chemicals that could harm public health and the environment.\n\nAnother component of this data asset are the results generated by the Priority Assessment Model (PAM), which analyzes information concerning low-level chronic emissions from facilities and sets priorities (low, medium, high) for proactive controls on releases that do not necessarily pose imminent threats, but which may under adverse circumstances create unacceptable health or ecological risks.\n\nAlso included are inspection records compiled by the Oil Inspection Program. Under the Clean Water Act Section 311, EPA regulates oil storage that meets a specific regulatory threshold. Facilities that store oil and meet the regulatory threshold need to prepare and implement a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan which needs to be reviewed and approved by a professional engineer. Additionally, facilities with larger oil storage capacity may have to prepare and implement a Facility Response Plan. EPA is the lead federal response agency for oil spills occurring in inland waters.\n\nAll other information that contributes to EPA's programs, policies and guidance concerning the prevention and mitigation of emergencies is included in this data asset.",

In response to the BP Spill in 2010, equipment in the TAGA buses monitored for air toxics known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The specific VOCs being monitored were benzene, toluene, and xylene. These substances are also associated with facilities such as gas stations, oil refineries, paper mills, and autobody shops. The TAGA monitoring found that these substances are not present or are being detected at low levels in the areas monitored along the Gulf Coast and in New Orleans, LA. The levels found were well below levels that would cause temporary discomfort, irritation, or other minor effects.",

Data can be filtered by cleanup program, geography, environmental indicators, controls, and cleanup stage. CIMC also provides some web services that integrate these data for others to use in their applications.",

             "description": "This data layer provides access to Hazardous Waste Corrective Action sites as part of the CIMC web service. Hazardous waste is waste that is dangerous or potentially harmful to our health or the environment. Hazardous wastes can be liquids, solids, gases, or sludges. They can be discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides, or the by-products of manufacturing processes. The RCRA Corrective Action Program, run by EPA and 43 authorized states and territories, works with facilities that have treated, stored, or disposed of hazardous wastes (TSDs) to protect public health and the environment by investigating and cleaning up hazardous releases to soil, ground water, surface water, and air at their facilities. RCRA Corrective Action sites in all 50 states and four U.S. territories cover 18 million acres of land. EPA estimates that more than 35 million people, roughly 12 percent of the U.S. population, live within one mile of a RCRA Corrective Action site (based on the 2000 U.S. Census). RCRA Corrective Action facilities include many current and former chemical manufacturing plants, oil refineries, lead smelters, wood preservers, steel mills, commercial landfills, and a variety of other types of entities. Due to poor practices prior to environmental regulations, Corrective Action facilities have left large stretches of river sediments laden with PCBs; deposited lead in residential yards and parks beyond site boundaries; polluted drinking water wells in rural areas with chlorinated solvents; tainted municipal water supplies used by millions; and introduced mercury into waterways, necessitating fish advisories. At these sites, the Corrective Action Program ensures that cleanups occur. EPA and state regulators work with facilities and communities to design remedies based on the contamination, geology, and anticipated use unique to each site. Note: RCRA facilities which are not undergoing corrective action are not considered \u201cCleanups\u201d in Cleanups in My Community. The complete set of RCRA facilities can be accessed via the EPA RCRA database in Envirofacts (https://www.epa.gov/enviro/rcrainfo-overview).

Collection, validation and verification of the Biennial Report (BR) data is the responsibility of RCRA authorized states and EPA regions. EPA does not modify the data reported by the states or regions. Any questions regarding the information reported for a RCRA handler should be directed to the state agency or region responsible for the BR data collection.  BR data are collected every other year (odd-numbered years) and submitted in the following year.  The BR data are used to support regulatory activities and provide basic statistics and trend of hazardous waste generation and management. \n\t\t\t\t\nBR data is available to the public through 3 mechanisms. 1. The RCRAInfo website includes data collected from 2001 to present-day (https://rcrainfo.epa.gov/rcrainfoweb/action/main-menu/view).  Users of the RCRAInfo website can run queries and output reports for different data collection years at this site.  All BR data collected from 2001 to present-day is stored in RCRAInfo, and is accessible through this website.  2.  BR data files collected from 1999 - present day may be downloaded directory in zip file format from (https://rcrapublic.epa.gov/rcra-public-export/?outputType=Fixed or https://rcrapublic.epa.gov/rcra-public-export/?outputType=CSV).  3. Historical data collected prior to 1999 may be ordered on CD. Please see contact information in this metadata file to order historical BR data.  BR data are typically published in December of the year following their collection.  Data must be received by authorized states and EPA regions if a state is not authorized to implement the BR program by March 1st of the year following collection, and are usually published in December of the year following collection. For example, data collected in 2001 would be received by states and EPA regions  by March 1, 2002 and states and EPA regions compile the BR data submitted by facilities and load the state data set into RCRAInfo, the system which EPA Headquarters (HQ) manage.  Then EPA HQ published the data files around December 2002. Additional information regarding the biennial report data is available here: https://rcrapublic.epa.gov/rcra-public-export/rcrainfo_flat_file_documentation_v5.pdf and here: https://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/biennial-hazardous-waste-report.  \n\t\t\t\t\nPlease note that the update frequency field for this data set indicates annual, but that the true update period is biennial (every other year).

The Challenge encourages electronics manufacturers, brand owners and retailers to strive to send 100 percent of the used electronics they collect from the public, businesses and within their own organizations to third-party certified electronics refurbishers and recyclers. The Challenge\u2019s goals are to: 1). Ensure responsible recycling through the use of third-party certified recyclers, 2). Increase transparency and accountability through public posting of electronics collection and recycling data, and 3). Encourage outstanding performance through awards and recognition.  By striving to send 100 percent of used electronics collected to certified recyclers and refurbishers, Challenge participants are ensuring that the used electronics they collect will be responsibly managed by recyclers that maximize reuse and recycling, minimize exposure to human health and the environment, ensure the safe management of materials by downstream handlers, and require destruction of all data on used electronics.  Electronics Challenge participants are publicly recognized on EPA's website as a registrant, new participant, or active participant. Awards are offered in two categories - tier and champion. Tier awards are given in recognition of achieving all the requirements under a gold, silver or bronze tier. Champion awards are given in two categories - product and non-product. For champion awards, a product is an item that is manufactured, developed or refined for sale and is in the marketplace; while a non-product is an internal or external plan, strategy or policy for an organization, as well as a service, program or item that is intended for individual sale to a consumer.

             "description": "As part of EPA's Food Recovery Challenge (FRC), organizations pledge to improve their sustainable food management practices and report their results. The FRC is part of EPA's Sustainable Materials Management Program (SMM). SMM seeks to reduce the environmental impact of materials through their entire life cycle. This includes how they are extracted, manufactured, distributed, used, reused, recycled, and disposed. Organizations are encouraged to follow the Food Recovery Hierarchy (https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/food-recovery-hierarchy) to prioritize their actions to prevent and divert wasted food.  Each tier of the Food Recovery Hierarchy focuses on different management strategies for your wasted food. The program started in 2011 and the first data were made available in 2012. The FRC is part of EPA's larger SMM program (https://www.epa.gov/smm).  Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire lifecycles. It represents a change in how our society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By looking at a product's entire lifecycle we can find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, and reduce costs. There are multiple challenge programs available as part of the SMM program, including the Food Recovery Challenge, the Electronics Challenge, the Federal Green Challenge, and the WasteWise program.  \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t",

             "description": "The 2016 Recycling Economic Information (REI) Report aims to increase the understanding of the economic implications of material reuse and recycling. The report shows that recycling and reuse of materials creates jobs, while also generating local and state tax revenues.   The 2016 REI Report covers the economic activities of nine sectors: ferrous metals, nonferrous metals (aluminum), glass, paper, plastics, rubber, construction and demolition, electronics and organics (including food and yard trimmings).  \n\t\t\t\t\nThe 2016 REI Report builds on work from a 2001 REI study. In 2001, to encourage the development of an economic market for recycling, EPA supported the creation of a national Recycling Economic Information (REI) Project and the related REI report, based upon the work of several states and regions. The REI report was a ground breaking national study demonstrating the economic value of recycling and reuse to the U.S. economy. Compiled through a cooperative agreement with the National Recycling Coalition, the study confirmed what many have known for decades: there are significant economic benefits in recycling.  The 2016 report focuses on the economic impacts of recycling rather than the environmental benefits, as the environmental benefits have been researched in detail. Accurately estimating the impact that recycling has on jobs, wages and taxes is important because the results can influence policy decisions and provide a more robust picture of recycling by adding an economic layer on top of the more heavily researched environmental impacts of recycling. For more information, please visit https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report.\n\nThe REI Report is part of EPA's larger SMM program (https://www.epa.gov/smm).

Currently, state authorization and adoption percentages are based on the required rules promulgated through RCRA Cluster XXII. Published federal register notices are the only legal mechanism by which EPA grants authorization to the states. If any of the information contained in the StATS database conflicts with information stated in the Federal Register, the Federal Register information will take precedence.

EPA implements the underground storage tank (UST) program in Indian country, providing support to tribal governments to prevent and clean up petroleum releases from USTs. The UST program in Indian country includes marketers and nonretail facilities that have USTs. Marketers include retail facilities such as gas stations and convenience stores that sell petroleum products. Non-retail facilities include those that do not sell petroleum products, but may rely on their own supply of gasoline or diesel for taxis, buses, limousines, trucks, vans, boats, heavy equipment, or a wide range of other vehicles. Of the more than 560 federally recognized tribes about 200 have federally-regulated underground storage tanks on their lands. Of those 200 tribes, over half have 10 or fewer active underground storage tanks. About 20 tribes have 30 or more underground storage tanks. Data on sites managed by this program is assembled by the EPA Regional Offices and varies from region to region in scope and content. Not all regions include Indian Nations. Publicly available data is limited to Excel spreadsheets, but regional contacts are also available to answer questions about the data. Data is updated in May and November of each year.",

As part of that regulation, Congress directed EPA to develop financial responsibility regulations for UST owners and operators. Congress wanted owners and operators of underground storage tanks (USTs) to show that they have the financial resources to clean up a site if a release occurs, correct environmental damage, and compensate third parties for injury to their property or themselves.\n\nOwners and operators have several options: obtain insurance coverage from an insurer or a risk retention group; demonstrate self-insurance using a financial test; obtain corporate guarantees, surety bonds, or letters of credit; place the required amount into a trust fund administered by a third party; or rely on coverage provided by a state financial assurance fund.\n\nInformation in this data asset includes state documentation to support this requirement. Many states have developed financial assurance funds to help owners and operators meet financial responsibility requirements and to help cover the costs of cleanups. State financial assurance fund programs, which supplement or are a substitute for private insurance, have been especially useful for small-to-medium sized petroleum marketers.\n\nEPA requires its Regional Offices to conduct annual reviews of state financial assurance funds. Data is provided by states, and reviewed by EPA, to determine financial soundness as follows:\n\n1. How quickly each state's fund is reducing its federally-regulated, fund-eligible cleanup backlog.\n2. Whether the fund currently has enough resources to address its backlog.\n3. Whether the fund will continue to have adequate resources to continue to reduce its backlog in the future.\n4. Whether there are any major or pending changes to the fund. \n\nEPA has the option of withdrawing fund approval, in which case the Agency works with the state to ensure that UST owners and operators have obtained an alternative financial responsibility mechanism.\n\nAll documentation for these reviews, and subsequent decisions and actions, are maintained at the Regional Offices.",

-            "description": "The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) in Public Health and Environmental Systems Division (PHESD) is currently engaged in research aimed at developing a measure that estimates overall environmental quality at the county level for the United States. This work is being conducted as an effort to learn more about how various environmental factors simultaneously contribute to health disparities in low-income and minority populations, and to better estimate the total environmental and social context to which humans are exposed. This dataset contains the finalized transformed variables chosen to represent the Air, Water, Land, Built, and Sociodemographic Domains of the total environment for the 2006-2010 EQI.",

             "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. U.S. EPA leads the accuracy assessment of NLCD land cover products in coordination with USGS and SUNY-ESF. The posted dataset includes map labels and reference labels for 4629 sample locations (pixels) from the NLCD 2016 database. The sample pixels were selected using a stratified random design based on the dual 2011 \u2013 2016 map labels. The data can be used to re-create the accuracy results reported in a forthcoming paper and in support of other applications. Accuracy results are reported for the 2011 and 2016 land cover products in the NLCD2016 database and for selected 2011-2006 changes.",

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources.

We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources.

We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.  This raster contains the modeled change in the seasonality of the month of maximum surplus precipitation between the target time period (in title) and the 1971-2000 Normal period (1 = same season, 0 = earlier season, 2 = later season).",

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.  This raster contains the modeled change in the seasonality of the month of maximum surplus precipitation between the target time period (in title) and the 1971-2000 Normal period (1 = same season, 0 = earlier season, 2 = later season).",

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

             "description": "Originators: US Environmental Protection Agency Publisher: US EPA Office of Research &amp; Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) Publication place: Corvallis, OR Publication date: Time Period of Data: 1900-2010; Projected data for 2041-2070. Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

             "description": "Originators: US Environmental Protection Agency Publisher: US EPA Office of Research &amp; Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) Publication place: Corvallis, OR Publication date: Time Period of Data: 1900-2010; Projected data for 2041-2070. Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration. This raster contains the modeled change in the average Feddema Moisture Index between the timeperiod specified in the title relative to the 1971-2000 Normal period.",

The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854).

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric.

             "description": "Originators: US Environmental Protection Agency Publisher: US EPA Office of Research &amp; Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) Publication place: Corvallis, OR Publication date: Time Period of Data: 1900-2010; Projected data for 2041-2070. Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration. This raster contains the modeled change in the average Feddema Moisture Index between the 2041-2070 modeled data (specified in the title) relative to the 1971-2000 Normal period.",

We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.  This raster contains the modeled change in the seasonality of the month of maximum surplus precipitation between the target time period (in title) and the 1971-2000 Normal period (1 = same season, 0 = earlier season, 2 = later season).",

Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854).

We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.  This raster contains the modeled change in the seasonality of the month of maximum surplus precipitation between the target modeled time period (in title) and the 1971-2000 Normal period (1 = same season, 0 = earlier season, 2 = later season).",

             "title": "Modeled change in the Seasonality between the modeled 2041-2070 (MRI-CGCM3 r1i1p1) and the 1971-2000 Normal period",
             "description": "Originators: US Environmental Protection Agency Publisher: US EPA Office of Research & Development (ORD) - National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) Publication place: Corvallis, OR Publication date: Time Period of Data: 1900-2010; Projected data for 2041-2070. Data location: GeoPlatform (\"https://www.geoplatform.gov/\") and EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway (https://edg.epa.gov/). Abstract: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. Projections that are not within two-standard deviations of the historical decadal average contribute to the vulnerability index for each metric. The resulting vulnerability maps show that temperature and potential evapotranspiration are consistently projected to have high vulnerability indices for the western U.S. Precipitation vulnerability is not as spatially-uniform as temperature. The highest elevation areas with snow are projected to experience significant changes in snow accumulation. The seasonality vulnerability map shows that specific mountainous areas in the West are most prone to changes in seasonality, whereas many transitional terrains are moderately susceptible. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. Purpose: These data were created in support of the US EPA\u2019s ACE CIVA 2.3, Task Project (QAPP: E-WED-0030854). However, these climate data and hydrologic landscape summaries should have broad applicability for hydrological, geomorphic, or ecological modeling, management, and restoration.  This raster contains the modeled change in the seasonality of the month of maximum surplus precipitation between the target modeled time period (in title) and the 1971-2000 Normal period (1 = same season, 0 = earlier season, 2 = later season).",

High marsh (HM) was defined as the aggregation of irregularly-flooded marsh [SLAMM category 7] and transitional salt marsh [SLAMM category 20]. HM is covered by water only sporadically (once per day or less). Based on SLAMM simulation outputs, we generated the gain and loss map by using the \u201cRaster Calculator\u201d tool under \u201cSpatial Analyst Tools\u201d in ArcGIS software. The methodology consists of the three steps listed below (where we use low marsh [LM] as an example). The same process can be applied to other SLAMM land cover categories. \n\n1) Open ArcMap, add SLAMM simulation raster outputs (all SLAMM categories) for baseline year and future years.\n\n2) In Raster Calculator, set the SLAMM code equal to 8 (low marsh = SLAMM category 8) to generate a new raster. Each individual cell in the new raster is assigned a value of \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. \u201c1\u201d is low marsh and \u201c0\u201d is any other SLAMM land cover category. Perform this step for both the baseline year and future year. \n\n3) In Raster Calculator, subtract the new raster for the baseline year from the new raster for the future year (formula = new future year raster - new baseline year raster). The calculation generates a new raster, in which each individual cell is assigned a value of \u201c-1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, or \u201c1\u201d. Based on the calculation, \u201c-1\u201d means low marsh loss in the future (the cell has converted from low marsh to a different SLAMM category), \u201c0\u201d means low marsh is remaining (the cell stays the same), and \u201c1\u201d means low marsh gain in the future (the cell has converted from a different SLAMM category to low marsh). \n\nPrior SLAMM work has been performed in the Delaware Bay, but our methods differ in that we derive results for specific marsh areas and utilize more recent, higher resolution elevation data (2015 USGS CoNED Topobathy Model: New Jersey and Delaware), the most recent SLR projections, and site-specific accretion data (through 2016). These SLAMM simulations were performed as part of a larger project by the USEPA on frameworks and methods for characterizing relative wetland vulnerabilities. \n\nNote: additional raster files from this project are available upon request. These include files from low and high SLR scenarios and different model protection scenarios. For more information, contact Jordan West (West.Jordan@epa.gov).",

             "description": "This raster GIS dataset contains 5-meter-resolution cells depicting the areas of HIGH marsh. High marsh (HM) was defined as the aggregation of irregularly-flooded marsh [SLAMM category 7] and transitional salt marsh [SLAMM category 20]. HM is covered by water only sporadically (once per day or less). Based on SLAMM simulation outputs, we generated the gain and loss map by using the \u201cRaster Calculator\u201d tool under \u201cSpatial Analyst Tools\u201d in ArcGIS software. The methodology consists of the three steps listed below (where we use low marsh [LM] as an example). The same process can be applied to other SLAMM land cover categories. \n\n1) Open ArcMap, add SLAMM simulation raster outputs (all SLAMM categories) for baseline year and future years.\n\n2) In Raster Calculator, set the SLAMM code equal to 8 (low marsh = SLAMM category 8) to generate a new raster. Each individual cell in the new raster is assigned a value of \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. \u201c1\u201d is low marsh and \u201c0\u201d is any other SLAMM land cover category. Perform this step for both the baseline year and future year. \n\n3) In Raster Calculator, subtract the new raster for the baseline year from the new raster for the future year (formula = new future year raster - new baseline year raster). The calculation generates a new raster, in which each individual cell is assigned a value of \u201c-1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, or \u201c1\u201d. Based on the calculation, \u201c-1\u201d means low marsh loss in the future (the cell has converted from low marsh to a different SLAMM category), \u201c0\u201d means low marsh is remaining (the cell stays the same), and \u201c1\u201d means low marsh gain in the future (the cell has converted from a different SLAMM category to low marsh). \n\nPrior SLAMM work has been performed in the Delaware Bay, but our methods differ in that we derive results for specific marsh areas and utilize more recent, higher resolution elevation data (2015 USGS CoNED Topobathy Model: New Jersey and Delaware), the most recent SLR projections, and site-specific accretion data (through 2016). These SLAMM simulations were performed as part of a larger project by the USEPA on frameworks and methods for characterizing relative wetland vulnerabilities. \n\nNote: additional raster files from this project are available upon request. These include files from low and high SLR scenarios and different model protection scenarios. For more information, contact Jordan West (West.Jordan@epa.gov).",

Based on SLAMM simulation outputs, we generated the gain and loss map by using the \u201cRaster Calculator\u201d tool under \u201cSpatial Analyst Tools\u201d in ArcGIS software. The methodology consists of the three steps listed below (where we use low marsh [LM] as an example). The same process can be applied to other SLAMM land cover categories. \n\n1) Open ArcMap, add SLAMM simulation raster outputs (all SLAMM categories) for baseline year and future years. \n\n2) In Raster Calculator, set the SLAMM code equal to 8 (low marsh = SLAMM category 8) to generate a new raster. Each individual cell in the new raster is assigned a value of \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. \u201c1\u201d is low marsh and \u201c0\u201d is any other SLAMM land cover category. Perform this step for both the baseline year and future year. \n\n3) In Raster Calculator, subtract the new raster for the baseline year from the new raster for the future year (formula = new future year raster - new baseline year raster). The calculation generates a new raster, in which each individual cell is assigned a value of \u201c-1\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, or \u201c1\u201d. Based on the calculation, \u201c-1\u201d means low marsh loss in the future (the cell has converted from low marsh to a different SLAMM category), \u201c0\u201d means low marsh is remaining (the cell stays the same), and \u201c1\u201d means low marsh gain in the future (the cell has converted from a different SLAMM category to low marsh). \n\nPrior SLAMM work has been performed in the Delaware Bay, but our methods differ in that we derive results for specific marsh areas and utilize more recent, higher resolution elevation data (2015 USGS CoNED Topobathy Model: New Jersey and Delaware), the most recent SLR projections, and site-specific accretion data (through 2016). These SLAMM simulations were performed as part of a larger project by the USEPA on frameworks and methods for characterizing relative wetland vulnerabilities. \n\nNote: additional raster files from this project are available upon request. These include files from low and high SLR scenarios and different model protection scenarios. For more information, contact Jordan West (West.Jordan@epa.gov).",

Based on the calculation, \u201c-1\u201d means low marsh loss in the future (the cell has converted from low marsh to a different SLAMM category), \u201c0\u201d means low marsh is remaining (the cell stays the same), and \u201c1\u201d means low marsh gain in the future (the cell has converted from a different SLAMM category to low marsh). \n\nPrior SLAMM work has been performed in the Delaware Bay, but our methods differ in that we derive results for specific marsh areas and utilize more recent, higher resolution elevation data (2015 USGS CoNED Topobathy Model: New Jersey and Delaware), the most recent SLR projections, and site-specific accretion data (through 2016). These SLAMM simulations were performed as part of a larger project by the USEPA on frameworks and methods for characterizing relative wetland vulnerabilities. \n\nNote: additional raster files from this project are available upon request. These include files from low and high SLR scenarios and different model protection scenarios. For more information, contact Jordan West (West.Jordan@epa.gov).",

             "description": "The Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for U.S. counties is a set of nationally consistent demonstration results that may be used to characterize community well-being. This composite index was developed by U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development in support of its Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) Research. It serves as an endpoint measure for use in the creation of community decision-support tools. The HWBI characterizes community conditions in the context of the flow of economic, social and ecological services. The index calculation approach used a nested-indicator design. A decade (2000-2010) of cultural, economic, and social data were drawn from publicly available sources (e.g., US Census, Bureau of Economic Analysis, American Community Survey, General Social Survey, Centers for Disease Control) to provide the foundation for well-being related indicators. Indicators are integrated into one of eight domains or sub-indices of well-being. These domains were synthesized to represent different aspects of well-being characteristics common across communities of all sizes. Service indicators reflect the availability of select socio-ecological services that influence well-being. Community decisions often result in changes in the flow of community services. Collectively, well-being and service measures provide a means to evaluate relationships between the availability of certain community services and overall well-being. Data used to generate service indicators were also collected from existing data sources. Detailed information about the attributes of the HWBI, its components and related service indicators are described in Indicators and Methods for Constructing a U.S. Human Well-being Index (HWBI) for Ecosystem Services Research (EPA/600/R-12/023. pp. 121) and Indicators and Methods for Evaluating Economic, Ecosystem and Social Services Provisioning (EPA/600/R-14/184. pp. 174), respectively.",

The ecoregions of Alaska are a framework for organizing and interpreting environmental data for State, national, and international level inventory, monitoring, and research efforts. The map and descriptions for 20 ecological regions were derived by synthesizing information on the geographic distribution of environmental factors such as climate, physiography, geology, permafrost, soils, and vegetation. A qualitative assessment was used to interpret the distributional patterns and relative importance of these factors from place to place (Gallant and others, 1995). Numeric identifiers assigned to the ecoregions are coordinated with those used on the map of \"Ecoregions of the Conterminous United States\" (Omernik 1987, U.S. EPA 2010) as a continuation of efforts to map ecoregions for the United States. Additionally, the ecoregions for Alaska and the conterminous United States, along with ecological regions for Canada (Wiken 1986) and Mexico, have been combined for maps at three hierarchical levels for North America (Omernik 1995, Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 1997, 2006). A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels of ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions. At Level III, there are currently 182 ecological regions for North America. Level IV ecoregions have been developed for the conterminous United States, but Level III is the highest level available for Alaska.

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions.

             "description": "Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 50 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 105 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).
