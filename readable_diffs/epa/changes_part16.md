The hippocampus also maintains a capacity for neurogenesis throughout life which is reduced in adult-onset hypothyroidism. This study examined hippocampal volume in the neonate and adult hippocampal neurogenesis after developmental and adult-onset TH insufficiency. Pregnant rat dams were administered 0, 3, or 10 ppm of propylthiouracil (PTU) via drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 until weaning. PTU at the high dose reduced body, brain, hippocampal weights on postnatal day (PN) 14, 21 and 78. Sub-regional analysis revealed decrements in hippocampal volumes at 10 but not 3 ppm PTU on PN23. In Experiment 2, one pair of adult male offspring of 0 and 3ppm-teated dams was placed on 3 ppm PTU from PN60, while a 2nd pair remained on control water. Adult neurogenesis was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50mg/kg, ip, 2X daily, X5 days) starting on PN90. Brains from animals perfused 1 and 28 days later were processed for immunohistochemistry. Although no volume changes were seen in neonates at 3ppm, thinning of the granule cell layer emerged in adulthood. Developmental TH insufficiency reduced BrdU+ve cells at 1-day with no further reduction at 28-days post-BrdU, indicative of a selective effect on cell proliferation. This was supported by fewer cells staining for the proliferative marker, Ki67. Adult only PTU did not impair neurogenesis or exacerbate effects seen with developmental exposure. A reduced capacity for neurogenesis may contribute to cognitive deficits evident in adults following moderate degrees of developmental TH insufficiency. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGilbert, M., J.

-            "description": "Laboratories and vivariums are maintained at ambient temperatures (Ta) of 20-24 \u2070C and it is widely accepted that mice maintained under these conditions are cold stressed. When mice are inactive and sleeping in the daytime, their zone of thermoneutrality associated with a basal metabolic rate is 30-32 \u2070C. If given a choice, mice will use thermoregulatory behavior to seek out thermoneutral temperatures during the daytime. The cold stress of a vivarium can be problematic to researchers requiring an animal model that is not stressed metabolically. However, it may not be practical or economically feasible to maintain an animal vivarium at thermoneutral temperatures. One problem with raising the Ta of a vivarium is that personnel wearing protective equipment will be subject to considerable heat stress. In this paper, we present plans for the construction and operation of a device that allows mice to utilize a refuge with a heated floor maintained at an approximate thermoneutral temperatures (30-32 \u2070C). The device is made of inexpensive, readily available materials and utilizes a disposable hand warmer (HotHands\u00ae) as a heat source. One hand warmer provides a thermoneutral environment for approximately 12 hours. This device is easily adapted to a standard mouse or rat cage and requires brief maintenance each day to change the heating pad.  With this device in a standard cage, mice can select an environment associated with thermoneutral conditions during the daytime when inactive and sleeping. At night, the mice are more active, have a higher metabolic rate, and prefer cooler Ta\u2019s. Egress from the warmed plate allows mice to seek cooler Ta\u2019s at night. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nGordon, C., E. Puckett, E. Repasky, and A. Johnstone.

Two experiments were conducted using a model deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP). In the first study, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos were exposed to 0.6, 1.9, or 6.0 mg IOP/L or control water in a flow-through system until reaching 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) at which time posterior swim bladder inflation was assessed.  To examine effects on anterior swim bladder inflation, a second study was conducted with 6 dpf larvae exposed to the same IOP concentrations until reaching 21 dpf.  Fish from both studies were sampled for T4/T3 measurements, gene transcription analyses, and thyroid histopathology.  In the embryo study, incidence and length of inflated posterior swim bladders were significantly reduced in the 6.0 mg/L treatment at 6 dpf.  Incidence of inflation and length of anterior swim bladder in larval fish were significantly reduced in all IOP treatments at 14 dpf, but inflation recovered by 18 dpf.  Throughout the larval study, whole body T4 concentrations were significantly increased and T3 concentrations were significantly decreased in all IOP treatments.  Consistent with hypothesized compensatory responses, significant up-regulation of deiodinase-2 mRNA was observed in the larval study, and down-regulation of thyroperoxidase mRNA was observed in all IOP treatments in both studies.

Cleft palate and neural tube defects can result from genetic defects or environmental exposures during development, yet very little is known about the effect of chemical exposures on fusion defects in humans because of the lack of relevant and robust human in vitro assays of developmental fusion behavior. Given the etiology and prevalence of cleft palate and the relatively simple architecture and composition of the embryonic palate, we sought to develop a three-dimensional culture system that could be used to study fusion behavior in vitro using human cells. We engineered human Wharton\u2019s Jelly stromal cell (HWJSC) spheroids of defined size and established that 7 days of culture in osteogenesis differentiation medium was sufficient to promote an osteogenic phenotype consistent with embryonic palatal mesenchyme. HWJSC spheroids supported the attachment of human epidermal keratinocyte progenitor cells on the outer spheroid surface likely through deposition of collagens I and IV, fibronectin, and laminin, and co-cultured spheroids exhibited fusion behavior that was dependent on epidermal growth factor signaling and fibroblast growth factor signaling in agreement with palate fusion literature.

The first tier of tests is intended to detect the potential for endocrine disruption mediated through estrogen, androgen or thyroid pathways, while the second tier is intended to further characterize the effects on these pathways and to establish a dose-response relationship for adverse effects.   One of these Tier 2 tests, the Medaka Extended One Generation Reproduction Test (MEOGRT) was developed by the USEPA for the EDSP and, in collaboration with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals.  The MEOGRT protocol was iteratively modified based upon knowledge gained after successfully completing nine tests with variations in test protocols.  The dataset  both the final MEOGRT protocol that has been published by the USEPA and the OECD, the iterations of the protocol that provided valuable insights into nuances of the protocol.  The various tests include exposure to 17\u03b2-estradiol, 4-t-octylphenol, o,p\u2019- dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, 4-chloro-3-methylphenol, tamoxifen, 17\u03b2-trenbolone, vinclozolin, and prochloraz. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nFlynn, K., D.

Reproductively-mature fish were exposed in a flow-through, measured test to either 50 or 500 \u00b5g flutamide/L for 8 d, followed by an 8-d recovery period in clean water. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4 and 8 days during each phase of the experiment. Flutamide (500 \u00b5g/L) caused significant reductions in relative gonad size of the females on days 8 of the exposure and 1 of the recovery, and reduced expression of secondary sex characteristics in males during the exposure phase of the experiment. Ex vivo gonadal synthesis of testosterone in both sexes (and 17\u03b2-estradiol in females) was reduced in the 500 \u00b5g/L treatment within 2 d of exposure; however, steroid synthesis returned to levels comparable to controls by the end of the exposure portion of the test.  Steroid synthesis in males exposed to 50 \u00b5g flutamide/L was greater than in controls on days 4 and 8 of the exposure. Both the enhanced steroid production in the low treatment males, and return to control levels in the high treatment males and females during chemical exposure are indicative of a compensatory HPG response. One contributor to this response could be increased expression of genes responsible for enzymes involved in steroid synthesis; for example, transcripts for both cytochrome P450 side- chain cleavage and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were significantly elevated in flutamide-exposed males. Overall, responses of the HPG axis in adult male and female fathead minnows exposed to flutamide were both dynamic and comparatively rapid during exposure and recovery. This has ramifications both for the development of short-term fish assays to detect endocrine-active chemicals, and the derivation of robust adverse outcome pathways for AR antagonists in fish. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMilsk, R., J.

Substantial increase of the Treponema population was observed in the biofilm anode at Eanode=+0.2 V, which reduced intracellular electron-transfer kinetics associated with the maximum specific substrate-utilization rate by a factor of ten.

However, there is limited information about the clogging mechanism of these systems that effects the infiltration. A permeable pavement site located at the Seitz Elementary School, on Fort Riley, Kansas was selected for this study. An 80-space parking lot was built behind the school as part of an EPA collaboration with the U.S. Army. The parking lot design includes a permeable interlocking concrete pavement section along the downgradient edge. This study monitored the clogging progress of the pavement section using twelve water content reflectometers and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges. This clogging dynamic investigations was divided into three stages namely pre-clogged, transitional, and clogged. Recorded initial relative water content of all three stages were significantly and negatively correlated to antecedent dry weather periods with stronger correlations during clogged conditions. The peak relative water content correlation with peak rainfall 10-min intensity was significant for the water content reflectometers located on the western edge away from the eastern edge; this correlation was strongest during transition stage. Once clogged, rainfall measurements no longer correlated with the buried tipping bucket rain gauges. Both water content reflectometers and buried tipping bucket rain gauges showed the progress of surface clogging. For every 6mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface. The results generally support the hypothesis that the clogging progresses from the upgradient to the downgradient edge.

We quantified toluene-induced suppression of motor activity in 123 lines of these flies during exposure to toluene, a volatile organic compound known to induce narcosis in mammals via its effects on neuronal ion channels. We then applied genome-wide association analyses on this effect of toluene using the DGRP web portal (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu), which identified polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with the variation in response to toluene exposure. We tested ~2 million variants and found 82 polymorphisms located in or near 66 candidate genes that were associated with phenotypic variation for sensitivity to toluene at P < 5 x 10-5, and human orthologs for 52 of these candidate Drosophila genes. None of these orthologs are known to be involved in canonical pathways for mammalian neuronal ion channels, including GABA, glutamate, dopamine, glycine, serotonin, and voltage sensitive calcium channels. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publications:\nBushnell, P., W.

Thus, we examined the mutagenicity in Salmonella TA100 of photochemical atmospheres generated in a steady-state atmospheric simulation chamber by irradiating mixtures of single aromatic VOCs, NOx, and ammonium sulfate seed aerosol in air. The 10 VOCs examined were benzene; toluene; ethylbenzene; o-, m-, and p-xylene; 1,2,4- and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene; m-cresol; and naphthalene. Salmonella were exposed at the air-agar interface to the generated atmospheres for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 h. Dark-control exposures produced non-mutagenic atmospheres, illustrating that the gas-phase precursor VOCs were not mutagenic at the concentrations tested. Under irradiation, all but m-cresol and naphthalene produced mutagenic atmospheres, with potencies ranging from 2.0 (p-xylene) to 10.4 (ethylbenzene) revertants m3 mgC-1 h-1. The mutagenicity was due exclusively to direct-acting late-generation products of the photooxidation reactions. Gas-phase chemical analysis showed that a number of oxidized organic chemical species enhanced during the irradiated exposure experiments correlated (r \u2265 0.81) with the mutagenic potencies of the atmospheres. Molecular formulas assigned to these species indicated that they likely contained peroxy acid, aldehyde, alcohol, and other functionalities. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nRiedel, T., D.

However, these pathways can have substantially different impacts on other environmental endpoints, such as air quality and energy-related water demand. This study uses an integrated assessment model with state-level resolution of the U.S. energy system to compare environmental impacts of alternative low-carbon pathways. One set of pathways emphasizes nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage (NUC/CCS), while another set emphasizes renewable energy (RE). These are compared with pathways in which all technologies are available. Air pollutant emissions, mortality costs attributable to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and energy-related water demands are evaluated for 50% and 80% CO2 reduction targets in the U.S. in 2050. The RE low-carbon pathways require less water withdrawal and consumption than the NUC/CCS pathways because of the large cooling demands of nuclear power and CCS. However, the NUC/CCS low-carbon pathways produce greater health benefits, mainly because the NUC/CCS assumptions result in less primary PM2.5 emissions from residential wood combustion. Environmental co-benefits differ among states because of factors such as existing technology stock, resource availability, and environmental and energy policies. An important finding is that biomass in the building sector can offset some of the health co-benefits of the low-carbon pathways even though it plays only a minor role in reducing CO2 emissions. \nThis dataset consists of source code, input data, and processed outputs for Ou et al.

Enjancements to AERMOD's building downwash algorithms based on wind-tunnel and Embedded-LES modeling. Atmospheric Environment, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.02.022. \nThe goal of this study is to improve AERMOD's ability to accurately model important and complex building downwash scenarios by incorporating knowledge gained from a recently completed series of wind tunnel studies and complementary large eddy simulations of flow and dispersion around simple structures for a variety of building dimensions, stack locations, stack heights, and wind angles. This study presents three modifications to the building downwash algorithm in AERMOD that improve the physical basis and internal consistency of the model, and one modification to AERMOD's building pre-processor to better represent elongated buildings in oblique winds.

Systemic effect levels were curated from ToxRefDB, HESS-DB and COSMOS-DB from numerous study types totaling 4382 in vivo studies for 1201 chemicals. Observed systemic effects in mammalian models are a complex function of chemical dynamics, kinetics, and inter- and intra-individual variability. In order to address the complexity problem, systemic effect levels were modeled at the study-level by leveraging study covariates (e.g., study type, strain, administration route) in addition to multiple descriptor sets, including chemical (ToxPrint, PaDEL, and Physchem), biological (ToxCast), and kinetic descriptors. Using Random Forest modeling with cross-validation and external validation procedures, study-level covariates alone accounted for approximately 20% of the variance reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) from 0.96 log10 mg/kg/day to 0.85 log10 mg/kg/day, providing a baseline performance metric (lower expectation of model performance). A consensus model developed using a combination of study-level covariates, chemical, biological, and kinetic descriptors explained a total of 38% of the variance with an RMSE of 0.76 log10 mg/kg/day. A benchmark model (upper expectation of model performance) was also developed with an RMSE of 0.5 log10 mg/kg/day by incorporating study-level covariates and the mean effect level per chemical. To achieve a representative chemical-level prediction, the minimum study-level predicted and observed effect level per chemical were compared reducing the RMSE from 1.1 to 0.8 log10 mg/kg/day. Although biological descriptors did not improve model performance, the final model was enriched for biological descriptors that indicated xenobiotic metabolism gene expression, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity, demonstrating the importance of accounting for kinetics and non-specific bioactivity in predicting systemic effect levels. Herein, we have generated an externally predictive model of systemic effect levels for use as a safety assessment tool and have generated forward predictions for thousands of chemicals. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nTruong, L., G.

In collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), EPA designed the WSTB facility to support full-scale evaluations of water infrastructure decontamination, real-time sensors, mobile water treatment systems, and decontamination of premise plumbing and appliances.  The EPA research focused on decontamination of 1) Bacillus globigii (BG) spores, a non-pathogenic surrogate for Bacillus anthracis and 2) Bakken crude oil.  Flushing and chlorination effectively removed most BG spores from the bulk water but BG spores still remained on the pipe wall coupons. Soluble oil components of Bakken crude oil were removed by flushing although oil components persisted in the dishwasher and refrigerator water dispenser.  Using this full-scale distribution system allows EPA to 1) test contaminants without any human health or ecological risk and 2) inform water systems on effective methodologies responding to possible contamination incidents. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSzabo, J., J.

+            "description": "The EPA\u2019s Water Security Test Bed (WSTB) facility is a full-scale representation of a drinking water distribution system.  In collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), EPA designed the WSTB facility to support full-scale evaluations of water infrastructure decontamination, real-time sensors, mobile water treatment systems, and decontamination of premise plumbing and appliances.  The EPA research focused on decontamination of 1) Bacillus globigii (BG) spores, a non-pathogenic surrogate for Bacillus anthracis and 2) Bakken crude oil.  Flushing and chlorination effectively removed most BG spores from the bulk water but BG spores still remained on the pipe wall coupons. Soluble oil components of Bakken crude oil were removed by flushing although oil components persisted in the dishwasher and refrigerator water dispenser.  Using this full-scale distribution system allows EPA to 1) test contaminants without any human health or ecological risk and 2) inform water systems on effective methodologies responding to possible contamination incidents. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSzabo, J., J. Hall, S. Reese, J. Goodrich, S. Panguluri, G. Meiners, and H. Ernst. Full Scale Drinking Water System Decontamination at the Water Security Test Bed.

To date no studies have examined how contrasting atmospheres with a similar Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), but with differing ratios of criteria air pollutants, might differentially affect health endpoints.  Here we produced two atmospheres with similar AQHIs based on the final concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter (PM2.5).  One simulated atmosphere (SA-PM) generated from irradiation of ~23 ppmC gasoline, ~5 ppmC of \u03b1-pinene, 529 ppb NO, and 3 \u00b5g m-3 (NH4)2SO4 as a seed resulted in ~976 \u00b5g m-3 PM2.5, 326 ppb NO2, and 141 ppb O3 (AQHI 97.7).  The other atmosphere (SA-O3) generated from ~8 ppmC gasoline, 5 ppmC isoprene, 874 ppb NO, 2 \u00b5g m-3 (NH4)2SO4 resulted in ~55 \u00b5g m-3 PM2.5, 643 ppb NO2, and 430 ppb O3 (AQHI of 99.8).  Chemical speciation by gas chromatography showed that photo-oxidation degraded the organic precursors and promoted the de novo formation of secondary reaction products such as formaldehyde and acrolein.

Seven day composite images were created by retaining the maximum value detected for each pixel within the time period and then the monthly mean of the maximums was calculated. A spatial mosaic composed of 54 individual scenes was generated for each week resulting in a total of 208 CONUS images from 2008 to 2011. Weekly OLCI data were also retrieved from January 2017 through December 2017. MERIS and OLCI data were processed by the NASA OBPG, using the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System, SRTM static land mask, and a transformation to Albers Equal Area with an area-weighted interpolation to match the projections of the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution. The SRTM land mask and SeaDAS processing is static in relation to waterbody size and did not account for periods of drought nor flood during the study period. Any water pixel adjacent to the SRTM static land mask was automatically flagged and excluded from analysis to reduce potential for mixed land-water pixels and land adjacency effects. To avoid pixel misclassification due to artifacts such as bridges, catchment facilities, and islands, \u201cvalid\u201d water pixels were determined by examining the ESRI World Imagery Basemap. This manual operator pixel selection process lowered the potential that land pixels were not misclassified as water or vice versa.\nEach 300m satellite pixel in a weekly CONUS map represents a provisional maximum Cyanobacteria Index (CI) value retrieved in the specific time period. The provisional CI was calculated using a spectral shape (SS) algorithm detailed and validated elsewhere. \n\nConventional methods to distinguish between ice and water often fail due to high ice reflectance as well as the possibility of cyanobacterial biomass formation under the ice. Therefore, weekly MERIS data were masked for the presence of ice and snow using Interative Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) Northern Hemisphere Snow and Ice Analysis data (Version 1, 4km). Daily snow and ice data were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center then cropped to the extent of CONUS. Snow and ice data were temporally binned into maximum weekly time composites to match the MERIS data and then converted from raster to shapefile format. If MERIS or OLCI CI values were within the spatial area of the snow and ice mask, they were removed from further analysis.

One group of possible contaminants are enteric viruses.  Measurement of viral quantities in environmental water systems are often performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or quantitative PCR (qPCR). However, true values may be underestimated due to challenges involved in a multi-step viral concentration process and due to PCR inhibition.  In this study, water samples were concentrated from 25 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) across the US to study the occurrence of enteric viruses in source water and removal after treatment.  The five different types of viruses studied were adenovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, enterovirus, and polyomavirus. Quantitative PCR was performed on all samples to determine presence or absence of these viruses in each sample.  Ten DWTPs showed presence of one or more viruses in source water, with four DWTPs having treated drinking water testing positive.  Furthermore, PCR inhibition was assessed for each sample using an exogenous amplification control, which indicated that all of the DWTP samples, including source and treated water samples, had some level of inhibition, confirming that inhibition plays an important role in PCR-based assessments of environmental samples.   PCR inhibition measurements, viral recovery, and other assessments were incorporated into a Bayesian model to more accurately determine viral load in both source and treated water.  Results of the Bayesian model indicated that viruses are present in source water and treated water.  By using a Bayesian framework that incorporates inhibition, as well as many other parameters that affect viral detection, this study offers an approach for more accurately estimating the occurrence of viral pathogens in environmental waters. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nVarughese, E., N.

We evaluated this technique using skin mucus from male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to control water or treated wastewater effluent at 5%, 20%, and 100% levels for 21 d, using an onsite, flow-through system providing real-time exposure.  Both sex-specific and non-sex-specific responses were observed in the mucus metabolome, the latter suggesting the induction of general compensatory pathways for xenobiotic exposures.  Altogether, 85 statistically significant treatment-dependent metabolite changes were observed and 30 of those annotated with probable structures.  The mummichog software package was used to elucidate impacted biochemical pathways and enhance metabolite annotation.  Partial least squares regression models revealed relationships between the mucus metabolomes and upregulated hepatic mRNA transcripts reported previously for these same fish.  These regression models suggest that mucus metabolomic changes reflected, in part, processes by which the fish biotransformed xenobiotics in the effluent.  Further, we detected a phase II transformation product of bisphenol A in the skin mucus of male fish.  Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of mucus as a minimally invasive matrix for simultaneously assessing exposures and effects of real-world mixtures of contaminants. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nMosley, J., D.

In vitro bioassays that can detect aromatase inhibition are part of both the EDSP tier 1 screening program and are included subset of ToxCast assays employed for EDSP21 screening. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) linking aromatase inhibition to reproductive dysfunction in fish has been described and endorsed by the OECD, establishing a scientifically sound connection between aromatase inhibition and adverse apical outcomes relevant to risk assessment and regulatory decision-making. Further, computational models that allow for quantitative prediction of dose-response time-course behaviors and the potential severity of the adverse outcome based on in vitro screening data have been developed. The present study provides further weight of evidence to support this AOP and its use in regulatory decision-making. In particular, it identifies rapid responses to aromatase inhibition that can be expected to occur within the first 24 h of exposure, examines the dynamic stability of gene expression responses over that period to help identify appropriate time periods in which characteristic gene expression responses may serve as effective biomarkers of exposure to aromatase inhibitors, and provides insights into different gene regulatory mechanisms that may be operating over the first few hours of exposure versus more systemic endocrine-related regulation that appear to take over after 6-12 h of exposure. These data continue to refine our understanding of this important mode of endocrine disruption and how to more efficiently and effectively both model and test for it to support regulatory decision-making. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nSchroeder, A., G.

-            "description": "Several models were used to describe the partitioning of ammonia, water, and organic compounds between the gas and particle phases for conditions in the southeastern US during summer 2013. Existing equilibrium models and frameworks were found to be sufficient, although additional improvements in terms of estimating pure-species vapor pressures are needed. Thermodynamic model predictions were consistent, to first order, with a molar ratio of ammonium to sulfate of approximately 1.6 to 1.8 (ratio of ammonium to 2\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202fsulfate, RN\u22152S\u202f\u2009\u2248\u2009\u202f0.8 to 0.9) with approximately 70\u202f% of total ammonia and ammonium (NHx) in the particle. Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Network (SEARCH) gas and aerosol and Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in Ambient air (MARGA) aerosol measurements were consistent with these conditions. CMAQv5.2 regional chemical transport model predictions did not reflect these conditions due to a factor of 3 overestimate of the nonvolatile cations. In addition, gas-phase ammonia was overestimated in the CMAQ model leading to an even lower fraction of total ammonia in the particle. Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements indicated less ammonium per sulfate than SEARCH and MARGA measurements and were inconsistent with thermodynamic model predictions. Organic compounds were predicted to be present to some extent in the same phase as inorganic constituents, modifying their activity and resulting in a decrease in [H+]air (H+ in \u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 air), increase in ammonia partitioning to the gas phase, and increase in pH compared to complete organic vs. inorganic liquid\u2013liquid phase separation. In addition, accounting for nonideal mixing modified the pH such that a fully interactive inorganic\u2013organic system had a pH roughly 0.7 units higher than predicted using traditional methods (pH\u202f\u2009=\u2009\u202f1.5 vs. 0.7). Particle-phase interactions of organic and inorganic compounds were found to increase partitioning towards the particle phase (vs. gas phase) for highly oxygenated (O\u202f:\u202fC\u202f\u2009\u2265\u2009\u202f0.6) compounds including several isoprene-derived tracers as well as levoglucosan but decrease particle-phase partitioning for low O\u202f:\u202fC, monoterpene-derived species. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nPye, H., W.

+            "description": "Several models were used to describe the partitioning of ammonia, water, and organic compounds between the gas and particle phases for conditions in the southeastern US during summer 2013. Existing equilibrium models and frameworks were found to be sufficient, although additional improvements in terms of estimating pure-species vapor pressures are needed. Thermodynamic model predictions were consistent, to first order, with a molar ratio of ammonium to sulfate of approximately 1.6 to 1.8 (ratio of ammonium to 2\u202f\u2009\u00d7\u2009\u202fsulfate, RN\u22152S\u202f\u2009\u2248\u2009\u202f0.8 to 0.9) with approximately 70\u202f% of total ammonia and ammonium (NHx) in the particle. Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Network (SEARCH) gas and aerosol and Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in Ambient air (MARGA) aerosol measurements were consistent with these conditions. CMAQv5.2 regional chemical transport model predictions did not reflect these conditions due to a factor of 3 overestimate of the nonvolatile cations. In addition, gas-phase ammonia was overestimated in the CMAQ model leading to an even lower fraction of total ammonia in the particle. Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements indicated less ammonium per sulfate than SEARCH and MARGA measurements and were inconsistent with thermodynamic model predictions. Organic compounds were predicted to be present to some extent in the same phase as inorganic constituents, modifying their activity and resulting in a decrease in [H+]air (H+ in \u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 air), increase in ammonia partitioning to the gas phase, and increase in pH compared to complete organic vs. inorganic liquid\u2013liquid phase separation. In addition, accounting for nonideal mixing modified the pH such that a fully interactive inorganic\u2013organic system had a pH roughly 0.7 units higher than predicted using traditional methods (pH\u202f\u2009=\u2009\u202f1.5 vs. 0.7). Particle-phase interactions of organic and inorganic compounds were found to increase partitioning towards the particle phase (vs. gas phase) for highly oxygenated (O\u202f:\u202fC\u202f\u2009\u2265\u2009\u202f0.6) compounds including several isoprene-derived tracers as well as levoglucosan but decrease particle-phase partitioning for low O\u202f:\u202fC, monoterpene-derived species. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nPye, H., W.

Treatment requirements to inactivate pathogens for production of Class A biosolids are energy intensive.  One less energy intensive alternative is to treat biosolids to Class B standards, but it could result in higher pathogen loads.  Quantitative microbial risk assessments models have been developed on land application of Class B biosolids, but contain many uncertainties because of limited data on specific pathogen densities and the use of fecal indicator organisms as accurate surrogates of pathogen loads.   To address this gap, a 12-month study of the levels and relationships between Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and human adenovirus (HAdV) with fecal coliform, somatic and F-RNA coliphage levels in Class B biosolids from nine wastewater treatment plants throughout the United States was conducted.  Results revealed that fecal coliform, somatic, and F-RNA coliphage densities were consistent throughout the year.  More importantly, results revealed that HAdV (\uf7c2=2.5x103 genome copies/dry g) and Giardia (\uf7c2=4.14 x103 cysts/dry g) were in all biosolids samples regardless of treatment processes, location, or season.  Cryptosporidium oocysts were also detected (38 % positive; range: 0 -1.9 x 103 oocysts/dry g), albeit sporadically.  Positive correlations among three fecal indicator organisms and HAdV, but not protozoa, were also observed.  Overall, study reveals the high concentrations of enteric pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and HAdV) are present in biosolids throughout the US.  Microbial densities found can further assist management and policy makers establish more accurate risk assessment models associated with land application of Class B biosolids. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nRhodes , E., L.

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to identify candidate markers of exposure to antiandrogens\r\nby analyzing endogenous metabolite profiles in the urine of male fathead minnows (mFHM,\r\nPimephales promelas). Based on earlier work, we hypothesized that unidentified lipids in the urine of mFHM\r\nwere selectively responsive to exposure to androgen receptor antagonists,which is otherwise difficult to confirm\r\nusing established fish toxicity assays. A second goal was to evaluate the feasibility of non-lethally and repeatedly\r\nsampling urine from individual mFHMs over the time course of response to a chemical exposure. Accordingly, we\r\nexposed mFHM to the model anti-androgens vinclozolin or flutamide. Urine was collected from each fish at\r\n48 hour intervals over the course of a 14 day exposure. Parallel experiments were conducted with mFHM exposed\r\nto bisphenol A or control water. The frequent handling/sampling regime did not cause apparent adverse\r\neffects on the fish. Endogenous metabolite profiling was conducted with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\r\n(GC\u2013MS), which exhibited lower variation for the urinary metabolome than was found in earlier work with\r\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, for inter- and intra-individual variations, the median\r\nspectrum-wide relative standard deviation (RSD) was 32.6% and 33.3%, respectively, for GC\u2013MS analysis of\r\nurine from unexposed mFHM. These results compared favorably with similar measurements of urine from other\r\nmodel species, including the Sprague Dawley rat. In addition, GC\u2013MS allowed us to identify several lipids\r\n(e.g., certain saturated fatty acids) in mFHM urine as candidate markers of exposure to androgen receptor\r\nantagonists.\r\nThe dataset that is uploaded here is the complete processed data from GC-MS instrument. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nCollette , T., D.

-            "description": "Understanding biotransformation pathways in aquatic species is an integral part of ecological risk assessment with respect to the potential bioactivation of chemicals to more toxic metabolites. The long-range goal is to gain sufficient understanding of fish metabolic transformation reactions to be able to accurately predict fish xenobiotic metabolism. While some metabolism data exist, there are few fish in vivo exposure studies where metabolites have been identified and the metabolic pathways proposed. Previous biotransformation work has focused on in vitro studies which have the advantage of high throughput but may have limited metabolic capabilities, and in vivo studies which have full metabolic capacity but are low throughput. An aquatic model system with full metabolic capacity in which a large number of chemicals could be tested would be a valuable tool. The current study evaluated the ex vivo rainbow trout liver slice model, which has the advantages of high throughput as found in vitro models and non-dedifferentiated cells and cell to cell communication found in in vivo systems. The pesticide diazinon, which has been previously tested both in vitro and in vivo in a number of mammalian and aquatic species including rainbow trout, was used to evaluate the ex vivo slice model as a tool to study biotransformation pathways. While somewhat limited by the analytical chemistry method employed, results of the liver slice model, mainly that hydroxypyrimidine was the major diazinon metabolite, are in line with the results of previous rainbow trout in vivo studies. Therefore, the rainbow trout liver slice model is a useful tool for the study of metabolism in aquatic species. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nTapper, M., J.

Development and evaluation of the R-LINE model algorithms to account for chemical transformation in the near-road environment. Transportation Research Part D, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2018.01.028. \nTo address the need to estimate near-road NO2 concentrations, we implemented three different approaches in order of increasing degrees of complexity and barrier to implementation from simplest to more complex. The first is an empirical approach based upon fitting a 4th order polynomial to existing near-road observations across the continental U.S., the second involves a simplified Two-reaction chemical scheme, and the third involves a more detailed set of chemical reactions based upon the Generic Reaction Set (GRS) mechanism. All models were able to estimate more than 75% of  concentrations within a factor of two of the near-road monitoring data and produced comparable performance statistics. These results indicate that the performance of the new R-LINE chemistry algorithms for predicting NO2 is comparable to other models (i.e. ADMS-Roads with GRS), both showing less than\u00b115% fractional bias and less than 45% normalized mean square error. \n\nThis dataset is associated with the following publication:\nValencia, A., A.
