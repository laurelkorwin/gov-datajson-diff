             "description": "Spatial variations in trace metal concentration are controlled by a complex set of parameters including reservoir sedimentation rates, dilution with pre-mining sediments, bed material mixing by shrink-swell processes, and factors that influence the sorption potential of the bed materials. Six years of below normal precipitation left much of the reservoir dry during the summer, 1992, and allowed for the precise delineation and mapping of the stratigraphic units that underlie Lahontan Reservoir.\n\nThe units were defined on the basis of spatial and topographic position, grain-size, composition, and the presence or absence of weathering zones. Once delineated, the units were mapped on 1: 12,000 scale aerial photographs. Subsequently, the photographic data were transferred to a stable base map for interpretation and analysis. Twelve stratigraphic units have been defined, nine of which post-date dam construction in 1915. One post-dam unit was deposited by eolian processes, while the remaining eight represent sedimentation in three lacustrine depositional environments: coastal, deep-water, and deltaic.",

Bus, commuter and light rail, and trolley routes managed and developed from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data available from the transitland feed registry (formerly from GTFS Data Exchange). Routes are developed from the GTFS data available through the transitland feed registry (https://transit.land/feed-registry/), formerly from the GTFS Data Exchange. GTFS data is provided to the exchange by the transit agencies and processed by SanGIS to create a consolidated GIS layer containing routes from both systems. SanGIS uses a publicly available ESRI ArcToolbox tool to create the GIS data layer. The toolbox can be found at http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=14189102b795412a85bc5e1e09a0bafa. This data set is created using the ROUTES.txt and SHAPES.txt GTFS data files.Routes layers for MTS and NCTD are created separately and combined into a single layer using ArcGIS tools.",

             "description": "American Samoa's primary industry is tuna processing by the Samoa Packing Co., user of the \"Chicken of the Sea\" label, and StarKist Samoa. Canneries thrive in this tiny U.S. territory because they allow Asian fishing companies to avoid U.S. import tariffs of up to 35 percent on processed fish. Goods have duty- and quota-free entry to the United States if 30 percent of their value is added in the territory. Federal law prohibits foreign commercial fishing vessels from offloading tuna at U.S. ports; however, American Samoa is exempted. Thus the greater part of the South Pacific tuna catch is landed here, supplying the United States with the bulk of its canned tuna, worth US$500 million a year. In aggregate, the canneries contribute about US$25 million a year to the local economy in wages, and spend another US$40 million on support services, fuel, and provisioning.",

These observations are organized according to the following map layers: Family Affairs Observations, Fleet Debris Levels, Return Vessels Special Reports, Roll Call Debris Data-Race, Special Report Debris-Race, Vessel Specific Observations, and Return Vessel Specific Levels Observations. The March, 2011 tsunami that affected northern Japan washed enormous amounts of debris out to sea. While most of this debris sank quickly out at sea, much remains on the surface and by ocean current and wind is working its way across the Pacific Ocean. In early days, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) could track the debris slick by satellite, but by early 2012, the debris had become too dispersed to track. News stories have reported containers with motorcycles on Haida Gwaii, whole fishing boats in Alaska, and sections of concrete dock in Oregon. Recent reports are about the struggles of local governments to deal with cleaning up and disposing of flotsam washing up on local beaches.",

             "description": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The TIGER/Line shapefiles include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).\n\nAn incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a state, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located.\n\nThe boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.\n\nThe boundaries of all incorporated places are as of January 1, 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).\n\nThe boundaries of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.\n\nNDEP extracted the Virginia City Census-Designated Place boundary polygon from the TIGER/Line database in 2020.",

             "description": "This is a summary of mercury (Hg) data from the Lahontan spillway area of the Carson River Basin.  USBR provided an information overview and reference source on mercury (Hg) in soils for water resources managers and researchers working in the Carson River Basin. \n\nThese data and the data tables provide results of the Lahontan spillway area, focused on the wetlands used by recreationalists and hunters, in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health exposure pathways. The original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada. Runoff and erosion from an estimated 236 'stamp mills', driven by flumes, resulted in a cummulative release of an estimated 7,500 Tons of elemental mercury into the Carson River Basin.  The elemental mercury, imported from mines in California and used to almalgamate the ore at the stamp mills, contaminated sediments throughout the Basin from the source area situated approximately between Carson City and Dayton, to the closed terminal wetlands in the Carson Sink.\n\nThis area is the primary source of Hg pollution in the Basin, considering the naturally occurring mercury concentrations are close to the crustal average.  During runoff and flood events, the River laterally cuts through the contaminated sediments in the overbanks and transports Hg with suspended sediments, and with concentrations rising with higher flow. When Lahontan Reservoir was built in 1915, it became a settling basin for suspended Hg from the Carson River, and while it retains up to 90 percent of influent sediments, the reservoir continues to pass significant concentrations of suspended and dissolved inorganic Hg and methylmercury (Me-Hg) downstream to the Carson Sink. This data was collected to help achieve goals set by the CWA that requires individual States to identify impaired water bodies and create enforceable WQ objectives to protect surface water quality within State bounds (CWA Sections 303d and 305 b).  These objectives were to focus on priority toxic pollutants, pursuant to CWA Section 307a. The EPA is publishing this data in support of the Carson River Mercury NPL Site in Nevada.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the OU2 Remedial Investigation Report (EPA, 2017), which describes the nature and extent of contamination from the Site.

Lead is a heavy metal that is often found in urban soil. It usually comes from sources such as chipped paint on pre-1978 housing, historic pollution from leaded gas, or lead recycling (smelting). Children exposed to lead can have health problems, including impaired brain and physical development. In June 2018, EPA and DTSC took soil samples in city-owned property along streets, not private property, at nearly 200 randomly selected locations across West Oakland. This area was selected because of its mix of possible sources of lead, including industry, older homes that may be painted with leaded paint and nearby freeways.",

             "description": "Investigations of wetlands in Lahontan Valley have documented concentrations of inorganic contaminants in water, sediment, and biological samples in excess of concentrations associated with adverse effects to fish and wildlife. Under the auspices of the Truckee-Carson-Pyramid Lake Water Settlement Agreement, the Department of the Interior has implemented a program to acquire rights for water to restore and maintain a portion of the historic wetlands in Lahontan Valley. Although inflow to wetlands will be partially restored, the effects of increased inflow to wetland contamination is uncertain.\n\nIn 1990, the Nevada State Office, in conjunction with Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), instituted a monitoring program on Stillwater NWR to assess implications of inorganic contaminants to fish, wildlife, and human health and to assess changes in inorganic contaminant concentrations in wetlands maintained With freshwater and agricultural drainage water. This program entailed the measurement of water quality parameters and the determination of trace element concentrations in water, sediment, and biological matrices. These data and the data tables provide results of the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge, Indian Lakes and Fallon National Wildlife Refuge, focused on the wetlands in order to measure concentrations of Hg to evaluate potential human health and ecological exposure pathways.\n\nThe original sources of Hg contamination in the Carson River Basin are from historic gold and silver mining and associated milling of the Comstock Lode near Virginia City, Nevada.

             "description": "The current conceptual site model (CSM) includes data gaps related to the extent of mercury contamination throughout the site, as well as the presence of other metal contaminants in soil. This study focuses on three areas in OU01: the Six Mile Canyon Area in Dayton, NV, the California Pan Mill Area in Virginia City, NV, and the Sacramento Mill Area just north of Virginia City, NV.  Surface and near surface soils with COC concentration greater than the project action limits present a potential risk for direct contact and soil migration. Data gaps exist in the understanding the sources, extent, and migration pathways of contaminants at this area and the applicability of the Incremental Sampling (IS) and (X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) approach to comply with the LTSRP. The project will address these data gaps through incremental sampling and real time XRF.\n\nData was compiled and evaluated for the IS Study where field sample collection techniques were evaluated as part of this study using XRF. Sample processing included seiving, to compare ISM with the current LTSRP method based on four five-point composite samples per residential parcel. The goal to is to validate the CSM and improve the screening of vast areas of mercury-contaminated soils while continuing to evaluate the performance of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation for the simultaneous analysis of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) in soil affected by the mining operations associated with the Comstock Lode. however sample processing will be. The most effective processing and analytical techniques will be selected for use in a follow-up study which will evaluate field sample collection. It is anticipated that the most effective and efficient sampling and analysis techniques will be incorporated into future investigations for the Carson River area.\n\nGeneral Comments: The location coordinates represent the center point of the Decision Unit (DU) as calculated by GIS. For DUs that cross roads or driveways (SMCD2 and SMCSCR-South) the midpoint may plot in the middle of the road. The center point for SMCCBS was selected manually due to the unusual shape of the DU. The calculated GIS center point falls outside of the DU.  DU columns provided on each tab for easy sorting and QC check. It is not a critical data point since the DU name is embedded in the Sample ID. For Source Units (SU) samples, the DU column is N/A if the SU was located outside of a DU, this column is filled out if the SU was located inside of a DU. Date represents sample collection date.\n  \nTab-Specific Comments: XRF field results did not use unique Lab ID sample #s so left that column blank. Did not establish specific XRF reporting limits for this project. Manually added a \u201cU\u201d for the XRF ND samples to match the lab formats. Region 9 lab results for the XRF comparison samples: Left all the ICP metals in the database. R9 lab DMA data only reported Pb, As, Se, and Hg per the team decision. SPLP Extraction #2 results for the samples selected for leaching analysis - removed the rows that identify the extraction procedure and contained no lab data. SPLP Extraction #3 results for the samples selected for leaching analysis - removed the rows that identify the extraction procedure and contained no lab data.

             "description": "This GIS dataset contains features depicting RCRA Corrective Action sites from EPA Region 1. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), among other things, helps ensure that wastes are managed in an environmentally sound manner so as to protect human health and the environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal. EPA and 44 authorized states and territories run the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action program to work with hazardous waste facilities to investigate and clean up any release of hazardous waste into the soil, ground water, surface water and air. In general, all generators, transporters, treaters, storers, and disposers of hazardous waste are required to provide information about their activities to state environmental agencies. These agencies, in turn pass on the information to regional and national EPA offices. Accidents or other activities at facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes have sometimes led to the release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into soil, ground water, surface water, or air. When that happens, the RCRA Corrective Action program is one program that may be used to accomplish the necessary cleanup. This data set provides boundaries for those areas where cleanup activities are underway. RCRA CABs and cleanup boundaries are meant to include the various boundaries associated with a site, including: institutional controls, engineering controls, land use controls, anticipated/acceptable use limitations, operable units, as well as the site or facility boundaries.",

The EPA Office of Research & Development (ORD) modified the original model from NOAA to fit the model parameters for the Buzzards Bay region. The models show storm surge extent for the Mattapoisett area and therefore the flooding area was reduced to the study area. Areas of flooding that were not connected to the main water body were removed.
