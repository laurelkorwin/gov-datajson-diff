             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer application to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Synthetic N fertilizer inputs in 2006 were estimated using county-level estimates of farm N fertilizer inputs. We acquired county-level data describing total farm-level inputs (kg N/yr) of synthetic N fertilizer to individual counties in 2006 from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2012/5207/). These data were converted to per area rates (kg N/ha/yr) of synthetic N fertilizer application by dividing the total N input by the land area (ha) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands within a county as determined from county-level (http://cta.ornl.gov/transnet/Boundaries.html) summarization of the 2006 National Land Cover Database (NLCD; http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_data.php). We distributed county-specific, annual per area N inputs rates (kg N/ha/yr) to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county using the raster calculator tool in ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA). Fertilizer data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

LiDAR data collected on November 18, 2010 was integrated for the Brown County portion. Eight land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees and forest, grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation, agriculture, and wetlands (woody and emergent). Wetlands were copied from the best available existing wetlands data.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains indices of geologic (lithosphere) conditions in the upstream catchments of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset summarizes several U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water budget and surficial groundwater datasets by 12-digit HUC. It includes average rates of evapotranspiration, quick-flow runoff, effective recharge (which reflects the quantity of water available to replenish the groundwater table), and total recharge (which also includes an estimate for the recharge quantity that was subsequently intercepted by riparian vegetation and converted to evapotranspiration) based on the USGS' 800m water budget estimates for the Conterminous United States (CONUS) at long-term timescales for 2000-2013. These datasets were produced by Reitz et al. (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7PN93P0).\n\nIt also includes modeled averages of depth to the water table, mean water transit time across the vadose zone (or unsaturated zone), shallow aquifer transmissivity, long term average soil water content of the unsaturated zone, and mean water residence time in the root zone, based on the USGS's MODFLOW-6 groundwater flow models. These models were driven by spatially-distributed recharge estimated by Reitz et al. using average water-budget information for 1985-2015 and calibrated against long-term average water levels in observation wells, as well as water-level estimates derived from perennial first-order streams and wetlands. The development of the model input and output files included in the USGS data release, as well as post-processing used to derive additional water-budget components also included in this data release, are documented in the Water Resources Research article (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026724).\n\nThis dataset was produced the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains information about hydrologic attributes of the upstream catchments and watersheds of stream confluences. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

The mapped area is confined to the boundaries of US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for Los Angeles County, with an added 1km coastal water buffer area extension. The following eight land cover classes were mapped: Water, Impervious, Soil or Barren, Trees or Forest, Grass or Herbaceous, Woody Wetlands and Emergent Wetlands. Integrated wetland features were derived using ancillary National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) polygon data (version 2), downloaded from the Unites States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Wetland Mapper web mapping service (https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/mapper.html). Metadata for the NWI wetlands data layer can be found at http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Metadata.html. An accuracy assessment of the classified product, using 887 completely random and 40 stratified random photo-interpreted land cover reference sample points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 61.1 percent and a fuzzy user's accuracy (RIGHT) of 89.2 percent. For data workflow processing details see Overview Description section. This dataset was produced by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, the United States Forest Service Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) assessment program, and the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Land cover attributes for stream confluence catchments for the Conterminous United States - 2001",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains land cover proportions for the upstream catchments of stream confluences for 2001. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Stream Confluence Dataset - Land cover attributes for stream confluence watersheds for the Conterminous United States - 2011",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains land cover proportions for the upstream watersheds of stream confluences for 2011. Stream confluences are important components of fluvial networks. Hydraulic forces meeting at stream confluences often produce changes in streambed morphology and sediment distribution, and these changes often increase habitat heterogeneity relative to upstream and downstream locations. Increases in habitat heterogeneity at stream confluences have led some to identify them as biological hotspots. Despite their potential ecological importance, there are relatively few empirical studies documenting ecological patterns across the upstream-confluence-downstream gradient. To facilitate more studies of the ecological value and role of stream confluences in fluvial networks, we have produced a database of stream confluences and their associated watershed attributes for the conterminous United States. The database includes 1,085,629 stream confluences and 383 attributes for each confluence that are organized into 15 database tables for both tributary and mainstem upstream catchments (\"local\" watersheds) and watersheds. Themes represented by the database tables include hydrology (e.g., stream order), land cover and land cover change, geology (e.g., calcium content of underlying lithosphere), physical condition (e.g., precipitation), measures of ecological integrity, and stressors (e.g., impaired streams). We use measures of ecological integrity (Thornbrugh et al. 2018) from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016) to classify stream confluences using disjoint clustering and validate the cluster results using decision tree analysis. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Manure application to agricultural lands from confined animal feeding operations by 12-digit HUC for the Conterminous United States, 2006",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean livestock manure application to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands by 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. Livestock manure inputs to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands were estimated using county-level estimates of recoverable animal manure from confined feeding operations compiled for 2007. Recoverable manure is defined as manure that is collected, stored, and available for land application from confined feeding operations. County-scale data on livestock populations -- needed to calculate manure inputs -- were only available for the year 2007 from the USDA Census of Agriculture (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). We acquired county-level data describing total farm-level inputs (kg N/yr) of recoverable manure to individual counties in 2007 from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Nutrient Geographic Information System (NuGIS; http://www.ipni.net/nugis). These data were converted to per area rates (kg N/ha/yr) of manure N inputs by dividing the total N input by the land area (ha) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture (agricultural) lands within a county as determined from county-level summarization of the 2006 NLCD. We distributed county-specific, per area N inputs rates to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county. Manure data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, and Ramsey Counties, MN. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

Three separate LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data sets collected on February 19, 2009 - August 2, 2010, December 1-2, 2011 and January 23-24, 2012 were integrated for Shelby Co., TN, Crittenden Co., AR, and DeSoto Co, MS. Five MULC classes were mapped directly from the NAIP and LiDAR data: Water, Impervious, Soil, Trees, and Grass/Herbaceous. Agriculture was derived from USDA Common Land Unit (CLU) data.

The roads are interstates, arterials, and collectors within the EnviroAtlas community boundary. In this community, tree cover is defined as Trees & Forest, and Woody Wetlands. Sufficient tree bufferage is defined as 25% coverage within the circular moving window with a radius of 14.5m at any given point along the roadway. There are potential negative health affects for those living in a location without a sufficient tree buffer. Those populations are estimated here using dasymetric data calculated for the EnviroAtlas.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The roads are interstates, arterials, and collectors within the EnviroAtlas community boundary. Forest is defined as Trees & Forest and Woody Wetlands. Sufficient tree bufferage is defined as 25% coverage within the circular moving window with a radius of 14.5m at any given point along the roadway. There are potential negative health effects for those living in a location without a sufficient tree buffer. Those populations are estimated here using dasymetric data calculated for the EnviroAtlas.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking, hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). The South Central Connecticut Regional Water Supply (RWA) estimates domestic water use at 50 GPD and supplies water to the western half of the study area.

Intersections are defined as any point where 3 or more roads meet and density is calculated using kernel density, where closer intersections are weighted higher than further intersections. Intersection density is highly correlated with walking for transportation. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

The road width is estimated for each road and percent tree cover is calculated in a 8.5 meter strip beginning at the estimated road edge. Percent tree cover is calculated for each block between road intersections. In this community, forest is defined as Trees & Forest and Woody Wetlands. Tree cover provides valuable benefits to neighborhood residents and walkers by providing shade, improved aesthetics, and outdoor gathering spaces.

The feature class has been edited for use in for EPA ORD's EnviroAtlas. Features in Canada and Mexico have been removed, the boundaries of three 12-digit HUCs have been edited to eliminate gaps and overlaps, the dataset has been dissolved on HUC_12 to create multipart polygons, and information on the percent land area has been added. Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have been removed, and can be downloaded separately. Other than these modifications, the dataset is the same as the WBD Snapshot included in NHDPlus V2. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit Counties, OH. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Seven classes were mapped using LiDAR and high resolution orthophotography: Tree Canopy, Grass/Shrub, Bare Soil, Water, Buildings, Roads/Railroads, and Other Paved Surfaces. These data were subsequently merged to fit with the EPA classification. The SAL project covered the five boroughs within the NYC city limits. However the EPA study area encompassed that area plus a 1 kilometer buffer. Additional land cover for the buffer area was generated from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) four band (red, green, blue, and near infrared) aerial photography at 1 m spatial resolution from July, 2011 and LiDAR from 2010. Six land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees, grass-herbaceous non-woody vegetation, and agriculture. An accuracy assessment of 600 completely random and 55 stratified random photo interpreted reference points yielded an overall User's fuzzy accuracy of 87 percent. The area mapped is the US Census Bureau's 2010 Urban Statistical Area for New York City plus a 1 km buffer.

Seven land cover classes were mapped: water, impervious surfaces, soil and barren land, trees and forest, shrubs, grass and herbaceous non-woody vegetation, and agriculture. An accuracy assessment using a completely random sampling of 598 land cover reference points yielded an overall user's accuracy (MAX) of 69.2% and an overall fuzzy user's accuracy of 75.4%. The area mapped includes the entirety of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP-LTER) area, which was classified by the Environmental Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics Lab (ERSG) at Arizona State University. The land cover dataset also includes an area of approximately 625 square kilometers which is located north of Phoenix. This section was classified by the EPA land cover classification team.

A potential view of water is defined as having a body of water that is greater than 300m2 within 50m of a residential location. The window views are considered \"potential\" because the procedure does not account for presence or directionality of windows in one's home. The residential locations are defined using the EnviroAtlas Dasymetric (2011/October 2015) map. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Potentially restorable wetlands for this map are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate water and historically had poor drainage and hydric soils. By restoring some of these wetlands, it is hoped that the benefits of wetlands would also be restored.

             "title": "EnviroAtlas - Percent Land Cover with Potentially Restorable Wetlands on Agricultural Land by 12-Digit HUC for the Conterminous United States",
             "description": "This EnviroAtlas dataset shows the percent land cover with potentially restorable wetlands on agricultural land for each 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC) watershed in the contiguous U.S. Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potentially restorable wetlands, as developed for this map, are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-fact-sheets).",

             "description": "The Percentage Potential Wetland Area by HUC-12 on Cultivated Cropland (Pct_PWAC) layer shows areas where conditions may be suitable for wetland restoration or creation on cropland at a 10-m resolution. Since the 1600's, an estimated 53% of wetlands in the Conterminous United States have been lost, with many areas being converted for agricultural or urban use. The ecosystems services provided by wetlands are extremely valuable, providing flood attenuation, water filtration, nutrient sequestration, vital habitat, and many others. Wetland restoration or creation can help restore these benefits for the surrounding community. There are several government and community projects that can utilize these data to assist in site selection for wetland restoration projects. \nThis layer was created using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The RF model utilized 17 data inputs to identify areas where attributes on the landscape are similar to the attributes found in existing wetlands. The input data for this layer fall into three categories: topographic variables, soils, and satellite imagery. \nTopographic - DEM's sourced from USGS 3D Elevation Program (10-m)\n-Elevation\n-Aspect\n-Slope\n-Compound Topographic Index (CTI)\n-Vertical Overland Flow Distance (VOFD)\n-Horizontal Overland Flow Distance (HOFD)\n-Pythagoras Overland Flow Distance (POFD)\n-Soils - Natural Resource Conservation Service's gNATSGO and gSSURGO products\n\u00b7 Potential Wetland Soils (PWS)\n-European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (10-m) \n\nUsing these variables, the Random Forest model was run for each 2 digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) in Google Earth Engine. The model used wetlands from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) to create training data, masking out deep water areas such as the centers of lakes and rivers, and excluding estuarine and marine wetlands. For each HUC an equal number of wetland and non-wetland training points proportional to the size of the HUC were generated, with 30% of those points being reserved for accuracy assessment. The model results were then summarized to calculate the areal coverage of PWA within each HUC-12 watershed in the United States. This dataset shows the percentage of each 12-digit HUC that is both potential wetland area and cropland.\n\n\nThis dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.

The US EPA's Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) was used to estimate the incidence of adverse health effects (i.e., mortality and morbidity) and associated monetary value that result from changes in pollution concentrations for Philadelphia City and County, PA, New Castle County, DE, Cecil County, MD, Camden County, NJ, Atlantic County, NJ, Gloucester County, NJ, Burlington County, NJ, Delaware County, PA, Bucks County, PA, Chester County, PA, and Montgomery County, PA. Incidence and value estimates for the block groups are calculated using i-Tree models (www.itreetools.org), local weather data, pollution data, and U.S. Census derived population data. This dataset was produced by the USDA Forest Service with support from The Davey Tree Expert Company to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.

Domestic water use, as defined in this case, is intended to represent residential indoor and outdoor water use (e.g., cooking hygiene, landscaping, pools, etc.) for primary residences (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). For the purposes of this metric, these publicly-supplied estimates are also applied and considered representative of local self-supplied water use. Domestic water demand was calculated and applied using the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) PWS Service Areas layer, population served per provider, and average domestic water use per provider. Within the EnviroAtlas study area, there are 108 service providers with 2016 estimates ranging from 26 to 323 GPD. In the absence of finer scale data, USGS Water Use Report county-level estimates were used for the study area extending into Delaware (80 GPD), Maryland (71 GPD), and New Jersey (80 GPD).

The flood hazard area is defined by the National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, https://msc.fema.gov/portal/advanceSearch). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.
