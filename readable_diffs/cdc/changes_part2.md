             "description": "Closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) are devices which replace traditional needles, septa, and other connectors used for transferring hazardous drugs (HDs). NIOSH recommends using CSTDs to limit occupational exposure to hazardous materials and sharps when compounding and administering these drugs (NIOSH 2004). One of the engineering challenges associated with CSTDs is management of the headspace that is either compressed or displaced when transferring liquids in and out of drug vials. CSTD designs and components employing various technologies include creating a physical barrier to contain the displaced volume of air or filters to clean the displaced volume of air when transferring HD solutions. In 2015, NIOSH developed a protocol to test material containment of barrier type CSTDs (NIOSH 2015). NIOSH presented a plan to update the testing protocol so that it was applicable to both barrier and air cleaning types of CSTDs (NIOSH 2016). Both barrier type CSTDs and air cleaning type CSTDs may be susceptible to either liquid or headspace vapor leaks. Air-cleaning type CSTDs allow free passage of air but are expected to remove semi-volatile hazardous drugs (HD)s from the exiting airstream. Barrier type CSTDs have been designed to contain air rather than clean it, and it is reasonable to conclude that a headspace leak with a barrier type CSTD would contain the drug at the same concentration as the headspace inside the vial. As a result, the procedure described in this paper can adequately assess the efficacy of barrier type CSTDs based on the volume of liquid and headspace vapor leak measured. However, the volatile compounds used in this procedure will readily pass through an air-cleaning CSTD, regardless of the ability to retain a semi-volatile HD. Therefore, testing the efficacy of an air-cleaning CSTD requires coupling the procedure described herein with an assessment of the ability of air cleaning CSTDs to retain an appropriate semi-volatile surrogate when volumes of headspace containing that surrogate are passed through the CSTDs. The difference in the amount of HD contained in liquid versus headspace vapor leaks may be several orders of magnitude. The work presented herein is a test method that can distinguish the origin and volumetric quantity of liquid and headspace vapor leaked.\n\nCSTD evaluation involves operation of CSTDs during normal use tasks, such as transferring a solution between two drug vials (NIOSH 2015). A test solution containing two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acetone and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), was used in the evaluation. Leaks were measured by detecting the VOCs in a glove chamber using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) as the detector. Liquid and headspace leaks are differentiated by the ratios of the two VOCs measured as a result of leaks from the CSTD. The compounds, acetone and MTBE, at equal concentrations in a test solution have a concentration ratio in the headspace vapor of the test solution that is very different, as predicted by their Henry\u2019s constants. The ratio of acetone to MTBE detected in the glove chamber can be used to elucidate the source, liquid or headspace, and the magnitude of a leak. The analytical strategy is similar to stable isotope mixing models used to determine contributions from various sources by measuring isotopic ratios (Phillips and Gregg 2001). Propylene glycol (PG) was included in the testing solution as a surrogate for a HD component, though it was not quantified. Fluorescein was included as a visual qualitative indicator of a liquid leak location. SIFT-MS offers low limits of detection and real-time response. The real-time response has the benefit of enabling leaks to be temporally correlated with tasks involving manipulation of CSTD components.",

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8eca985039464f4d83467b8f6aeb1320 for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.",

Tetanus to Vibriosis - 2015.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \ufffd\ufffd Any species of the family Vibrionaceae, other than toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139.",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

             "description": "Reporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued on May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implemented these case definitions. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process</b>\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported from state and local health departments through a robust process with the following steps:\n<ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration and set up alerts to monitor for discrepancies in the data.</li><li>CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>County level data were aggregated to obtain state- and territory- specific totals.</li><li>Counting of cases and deaths is based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in these data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data are organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts are calculated as the week-to-week change in cumulative counts of cases and deaths reported (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the prior week.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues.\n\n<b>Description</b>\nThis archived public use dataset focuses on the cumulative and weekly case and death rates per 100,000 persons within various sociodemographic factors across all states and their counties. All resulting data are expressed as rates calculated as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 persons in counties meeting various classification criteria using <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html\">the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program</a> (2019 Vintage).\n\nEach county within jurisdictions is classified into multiple categories for each factor. All rates in this dataset are based on classification of counties by the characteristics of their population, not individual-level factors.  This applies to each of the available factors observed in this dataset. Specific factors and their corresponding categories are detailed below.\n\n<b>Population-level factors</b>\nEach unique population factor is detailed below. Please note that the \u201cClassification\u201d column describes each of the 12 factors in the dataset, including a data dict",

By using information from the study, prevalence of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (CWP) was related to indexes of dust exposure obtained from research and compliance sampling data. Clear relationships between prevalences of both simple CWP and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and estimated dust exposure were seen. Additional effects independently associated with coal rank (% carbon) and age were also seen. Logistic model fitting indicated that between 2% and 12% of miners exposed to a 2-mg/m3 dust environment in bituminous coal mines would be expected to have Category 2 or greater CWP after a 40-yr working life; PMF would be expected for between 1.3% and 6.7%. The risks for anthracite miners appeared to be greater. There was a suggestion of a background level of abnormality, not associated with dust exposure, but increasing with age. Although there are certain we",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

             "description": "On October 20, 2022, CDC began retrieving aggregate case and death data from jurisdictional and state partners weekly instead of daily. This dataset contains archived historical community transmission and related data elements by county. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly historical community transmission data by county can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this historical dataset with the daily county-level transmission data from January 22, 2020, and a dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original dataset</a> with daily data as posted is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days\u2019 data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa",

             "description": "This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

Data from 2008-2012 are reported on an annual basis; beginning in 2013 data are reported on a quarterly basis.  Data include state-level information on Medicaid coverage of approved medications by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tobacco cessation treatment; types of counseling recommended by the Public Health Service (PHS) and barriers to accessing cessation treatment. Note: Section 2502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires all state Medicaid programs to cover all FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications as of January 1, 2014. However, states are currently in the process of modifying their coverage to come into compliance with this requirement. Data in the STATE System on Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation medications reflect evidence of coverage that is found in documentable sources, and may not yet reflect medications covered under this requirement.",

             "description": "This dataset contains model-based census tract-level estimates for the PLACES 2022 release. PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

             "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

             "description": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of stable man-mad surfactants that are incorporated into numerous products for their water and oil resistance and have been associated with adverse health effects.   The present study evaluated the systemic and immunotoxicity of sub-chronic 28- or 10-day dermal exposure of PFHxS (0.625-5% or 15.63-125 mg/kg/dose) in a murine model.  Elevated levels of PFHxS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route.  Liver weight (% body) significantly increased and spleen weight (% body) significantly deceased with PFHxS exposure supported by histopathological changes. Additionally, PFHxS significantly reduced the humoral immune response and altered immune subsets in the spleen, suggesting immunosuppression.  Gene expression changes were observed in the liver, skin, and spleen with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, necrosis, and inflammation.  Immune-cell phenotyping identified significant decreases in B-cells, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in the spleen along with increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and neutrophils in the skin.  These findings support dermal PFHxS-induced liver damage and immune suppression.  These data support PFHxS absorption through the skin and demonstrate immunotoxicity via this exposure route, raising concern about prompting the need for further investigation.",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Data for Carbapenemase-producing Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CP-CRE) will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for this condition.",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\". NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

             "description": "This dataset contains model-based county-level estimates for the PLACES 2021 release. PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

             "description": "Reporting of new Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. This dataset will receive a final update on June 1, 2023, to reconcile historical data through May 10, 2023, and will remain publicly available.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process </b>\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, data have been gathered through a robust process with the following steps: \n<ul><li>A CDC data team reviews and validates the information obtained from jurisdictions\u2019 state and local websites via an overnight data review process.</li>\n<li>If more than one official county data source exists, CDC uses a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source, and takes the highest case and death counts respectively, unless otherwise specified by the state. </li>\n<li>CDC compiles these data and posts the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker. </li>\n<li>County level data is aggregated to obtain state and territory specific totals.</li>\n</ul>This process is collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. CDC may retrospectively update counts to correct data quality issues. \n\n<b>Methodology Changes </b>\nSeveral differences exist between the current, weekly-updated dataset and the archived version: \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is based on county-level aggregate count data, while the Archived Version is based on State-level aggregate count data. </li>\n<li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:\u202f</b> While the probable cases and deaths are included in the total case and total death counts in both versions (if applicable), they were reported separately from the confirmed cases and deaths by jurisdiction in the Archived Version.\u202f In the current Weekly-Updated Version, the counts by jurisdiction are not reported by confirmed or probable status (See Confirmed and Probable Counts section for more detail).</li>\n<li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The current Weekly-Updated Version contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per jurisdiction), while the Archived Version contains daily time series data (i.e., one record per day per jurisdiction). </li>\n<li><b>Update Frequency:</b>\u202fThe current Weekly-Updated Version is updated weekly, while the Archived Version was updated twice daily up to October 20, 2022. </li></ul>\n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts. \n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts </b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status. Instead, confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available. Not all jurisdictions report probable cases and deaths to CDC.* Confirmed and probable case definition criteria are described here: \n\n<a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/ps2022/22-ID-01_COVID19.pdf\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (ymaws.com).</a>\n\n<b>Deaths</b>\nCDC reports death data on other sections of the website: <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home\"> CDC COVID Data Tracker: Home</a>, <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#cases_casesper100klast7days\">CDC COVID Data Tracker: Cases, Deaths, and Testing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts</a>.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.",

Settings currently include inpatient and emergency departments (ED). Additionally, the NHCS contributes data that may inform public health emergencies as the survey is designed to capture emerging diseases and viruses that require hospitalizations, including COVID-19 encounters. The 2020 - 2023 NHCS are not yet fully operational so it is important to note that these data are not nationally representative.\n\nThe data are from 26 hospitals submitting inpatient and 26 hospitals submitting ED Uniform Bill (UB)-04 administrative claims from March 18, 2020-December 26, 2023.  Even though the data are not nationally representative, they can provide insight on the impact of COVID-19 on various types of hospitals throughout the country. This information is not available in other hospital reporting systems. The NHCS data from these hospitals can show results by a combination of indicators related to COVID-19, such as length of inpatient stay, in-hospital mortality, comorbidities, and intubation or ventilator use. NHCS data allow for reporting on patient conditions and treatments within the hospital over time.",

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at  www.cdc.gov/places.",

The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at  www.cdc.gov/places.",

             "description": "Masks block aerosols produced during coughs and exhalations (\u201csource control\u201d). Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (\u201csource\u201d) and a breathing simulator (\u201crecipient\u201d) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.",

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates  include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

To create county-level estimates, we used a PUMA-to-county crosswalk from the Missouri Census Data Center(https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2014.html). PUMAs spanning multiple counties had their estimates apportioned across those counties based on overall 2010 Census populations.\n\nThe HPS is nationally representative and includes information on U.S. residents\u2019 intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, as well as other sociodemographic and geographic (state, region and metropolitan statistical areas) information. The ACS is a nationally representative survey, and it provides key sociodemographic and geographic (state, region, PUMAs, county) information. We utilized data for the survey collection period May 26, 2021 \u2013 June 7, 2021, which the HPS refers to as Week 31..\n\nPUMA COVID-19 Hesitancy Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-Public-Use-Microdat/djj9-kh3p",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

States periodically conduct independent screening surveys of a probability sample designed to be representative of all third-grade students in the state. Some states also conduct surveys of students in other grades in school, or of Head Start program enrollees. This surveillance activity is voluntary. States submit their data to the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD), where the survey design and data collected are reviewed for quality and against the criteria for inclusion in NOHSS, before being sent to CDC for inclusion in Oral Health Data.

             "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related scocial needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population data, and American Community Survey 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at   www.cdc.gov/places.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.

To supplement the national inventory of NIOSH Approved\u00ae N95 FFRs during times of extreme shortages, FFR reuse following decontamination is a possible strategy. Decontamination is a process to reduce the number of pathogens on used FFRs before reuse. An effective FFR decontamination technique should significantly reduce the pathogen burden, but not reduce a respirator\u2019s filtration performance or its ability to fit properly. Another consideration is that no hazardous chemical residue should be left on the FFR following the decontamination process.",

Arboviral diseases, neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive, West Nile virus disease to Babesiosis - 2019.In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers'. NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\n\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease.",

             "description": "The occupational exposure risk to peracetic acid (PAA), a common disinfectant and sterilant use in industrial settings like healthcare facilities and meat processing plants, is typically assessed through collection and analysis of atmospheric workplace samples. In this study, a new personal sampling technique was developed for determining the atmospheric concentration of PAA in the workplace. Samples of humidified air containing peracetic acid (concentration range: 25-2000 ppb) were collected on 350-mg XAD-7 solid sorbent tubes to adsorb the analyte. Peracetic acid was desorbed using anhydrous acetonitrile, after which it was treated with excess cyclohexene to generate the corresponding epoxide via the Prilezhaev reaction. The epoxide product was analyzed and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indirectly determining the amount of peracetic acid in the original air sample. The specificity for peracetic acid over other contaminants was assessed through a series of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetic acid (AA) spiking experiments, in which selectivity for PAA was demonstrated at several different concentrations of both HP and AA. The limit-of-detection (LOD) and the limit-of-quantitation (LOQ) for this method was determined to be 60 ppb and 198 ppb, respectively. Unlike many other methods, the sorbent tube negates the need for solvent in the sampling apparatus, adding to its ease of use. These features as well as inexpensive materials and the use of small, wearable vacuum pumps could allow for implementation of easier personal sampling in the workplace.",

             "description": "Nanotechnology is one of the most rapidly developing areas of the economy and involves the study and control of matter in the nanoscale. The nanoscale is the size range from 1 to 100 nm. Recently, some nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to enter the brain through the olfactory pathway from the nose to the brain. \u2060This pathway can potentially enable inhaled nanomaterials to enter the brain. Inhalation exposures are technically difficult and expensive. Intranasal instillation is a potential screening tool for evaluating nose to brain transport. However, particles in aqueous media tend to agglomerate and agglomerated particles often act like larger particles in terms of surface area, toxicity, and size thresholds for transport pathways. For neuronal transport within the brain, the upper size limit is estimated to be approximately 100 nm. Therefore, nanomaterials must be adequately dispersed in the vehicle used for instillation in order to evaluate their potential for transport from the nose to the brain.\n\nBecause 100 nm is the upper size limit estimated for transport within the central nervous system, components of dispersion media may need to be different from dispersion media used to evaluate toxicity in other tissues. For example, albumin, a protein which is useful in dispersion media developed for the lung, can interact with nanomaterials and increase their size. In addition, neurons transport sodium out of the cell, suggesting that a dispersion medium to evaluate nose-to-brain transport should avoid high sodium concentrations. To overcome issues with the size of albumin and other proteins as well as the potential effects of sodium and phosphate, we hypothesized that free amino acids, a balanced electrolyte solution, and a mixture of phospholipids could produce a solution that both dispersed nanomaterials and was compatible with neuronal transport. This study describes and characterizes a solution for nasal and olfactory transport (SNOT) that can disperse nanomaterials and dyes with nanoscale dimensions, enabling intranasal instillation so that potential nose-to-brain transport can be evaluated.",

             "description": "Concentrated collection of aerosol particles on a substrate is essential for their chemical analysis using various microscopy and laser spectroscopic techniques. An impaction-based aerosol concentration system was developed for focused collection of particles using a multi-stage nozzle that consists of a succession of multiple smooth converging stages. Converging sections of the nozzle were designed to focus and concentrate a particle diameter range of 900 to 2500 nm into a relatively narrower particle beam to obtain particulate deposits with spot diameters of 0.5-1.56 mm. A slightly diverging section before the last contractions was included to allow for better focusing of particles at the lower end of the collectable diameter range. The characterization of this multi-stage nozzle and the impaction-based aerosol concentration system encompassing the nozzle was accomplished both numerically and experimentally. The numerical and experimental trends in collection efficiency and spot diameters agreed well qualitatively; however, the quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results for wall losses was poor, particularly for larger particle diameters. The resulting concentrated particulate deposit, a spot sample, was analysed using Raman spectroscopy to probe effect of spot size on analytical sensitivity of measurement. The method\u2019s sensitivity was compared against other conventional techniques, such as filtration and aerosol focused impaction, implementing condensational growth.  Impaction encompassing the multi-stage focusing nozzle is the only method that can ensure high sensitivity at Reynolds numbers greater than 2000, that can be supported by small pumps which renders such method suitable for portable instrumentation.",

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.\u202f \n\nNote that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. \n\nMore information on HSAs is available <a href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html\"><b>here</b></a>.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as \u201csparse\u201d.  \n\nFor additional information, please see: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n\nUpdated once per week on Fridays.\u202f",

             "description": "Thermal spray coating is an industrial process where molten metal is sprayed onto a surface as a protective coat at high velocity. Using acellular, in vitro, and in vivo models, the toxicity of these aerosols was evaluated. An automated electric arc wire thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system were developed to simulate an occupational exposure in an experimental model. Using the inhalation system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to stainless steel PMET720 aerosols at 25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d. Lung injury, inflammation, and cytokine alteration were determined. Resolution of the response was assessed by evaluating these parameters at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. The aerosols generated were also collected and characterized. Macrophages were exposed to 0 \u2013 200 \u00b5g/ml of the collected particles to determine cytotoxicity and screened for known mechanisms of toxicity. Other metal particles similar in composition and morphology, gas metal arc (GMA-SS) and manual metal arc (MMA-SS) stainless steel, were used as particle controls. The influence of pressure used during the process on the toxicity profile of the generated aerosols also was assessed and found to be minimal. The PMET720 thermal spray coating particles exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity and membrane damage only at the highest dose tested. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed the PMET720 particles to have oxidative stress potential and caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular oxidative stress. There also was a dose-dependent increase in NF-kB/AP-1 activity. Treatment with uptake inhibitors showed that the PMET720 particles were internalized via clathrin- and caveolar-mediated endocytosis as wells as actin-dependent pinocytosis/phagocytosis. In most of the cell assays, the two welding fume control particles generated a greater response compared to the PMET720 particles. In vivo, lung damage, inflammation and alteration in cytokines were observed 1 day after inhalation exposure, and this response returned to air control exposure levels by day 7. Alveolar macrophages retained the particulate even after 28 days after exposure. The results suggest that compared to stainless steel welding fumes, the PMET 720 aerosols were less potent, and the animals recovered from the acute pulmonary toxicity induced after 7 days.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.",

The program funding information is as follow:\n\nTESTING\nThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) which provided $4.8 billion to reimburse providers for testing the uninsured; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the FFCRCA (P.L. 116-127) and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139) (PPPHCEA), which each appropriated $1 billion to reimburse health care entities for conducting COVID-19 testing for the uninsured.\n \nTREATMENT & VACCINATION\nThe Provider Relief Fund, which includes funds received from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, as appropriated in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136), provided $100 billion in relief funds. The PPPHCEA appropriated an additional $75 billion in relief funds and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act (P.L. 116-260) appropriated another $3 billion. Within the Provider Relief Fund, a portion of the funding from these sources will be used to support healthcare-related expenses attributable to the treatment of uninsured individuals with COVID-19 and vaccination of uninsured individuals.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022\tThese are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\n\u00a7 Please refer to the CDC WONDER publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

             "description": "This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning. \n\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Prevalence of CWP was related to estimated cumulative dust exposure, age, and rank of coal. On the basis of these data, miners of medium to low rank coal, who work for 40 years at the current federal dust limit of 2 mg/m3, are predicted to have a 1.4% risk of having progressive massive fibrosis on retirement. Higher prevalences are predicted for less severe categories of CWP. Miners in high rank coal areas appear to be at greater risk than those mining medium and low rank coals. Ex-miners who said that they left mining for health-related reasons had higher levels of abnormality compared to current miners.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease.",

Babesiosis to Campylobacteriosis - 2015.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 or 2014\u20132018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\n U: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed.  The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.   NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change.   For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u2020 Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\u00a7 Updated weekly from the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance).  Data for Jamestown Canyon virus, La Crosse virus, Chikungunya virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, St. Louis virus, and Western equine encephalitis virus diseases are available in Table I. \r\n\u00b6 Not reportable in all states.

Many state statutes and regulations authorize and define the use of electronic health information (EHI). Practitioners often criticize these laws as complex and contradictory and point to them as barriers to using EHI. Attorney researchers used WestlawNext to search for EHI-related statutes and regulations of the US states, US\r\nterritories, and the District of Columbia in effect as of January 2014. The researchers independently catalogued provisions by the EHI use described in the law.

These data include percent of tests positive values for the detection of severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) reported to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a sentinel network of laboratories located through the US, includes clinical, public health and commercial laboratories; additional information available at: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/index.html. Influenza results include clinical laboratory test results from NREVSS and U.S. World Health Organization collaborating laboratories; more details about influenza virologic surveillance are available here:\u202fhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.html. \n\nData represent calculations based on laboratory tests performed, not individual people tested. RSV and COVID-19 are limited to nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), also listed as polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR). Participating laboratories report weekly to CDC the total number of RSV tests performed that week and the number of those tests that were positive. The RSV trend graphs display the national average of the weekly % test positivity for the current, previous, and following weeks in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by percent (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change.",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\". NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

             "description": "This dataset represents preliminary estimates of cumulative U.S. RSV \u2013associated disease burden estimates for the 2024-2025 season, including outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Real-time estimates are preliminary and based on continuously collected surveillance data from patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The data  come from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET), a surveillance platform that captures data from hospitals that serve about 8% of the U.S. population. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of RSV-associated disease burden estimates that have occurred since October 1, 2024.  \n\n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent RSV-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.  \n\n<b>Note:</b> Preliminary burden estimates are not inclusive of data from all RSV-NET sites. Due to model limitations, sites with small sample sizes can impact estimates in unpredictable ways and are excluded for the benefit of model stability. CDC is working to address model limitations and include data from all sites in final burden estimates.  \n\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

             "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates. PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\n U: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n *Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n\u2020 Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for tuberculosis are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.\r\n\r\n\u00a7 Based on the CSTE Position Statement 15-ID-03: Revision of the Case Definition of Hepatitis C for National Notification, acute hepatitis C is now reported by case classification status.",

The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.  NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide national estimates for subgroups defined by sex, age, and race/ethnicity.",

The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.  NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide national estimates for subgroups defined by sex, age, and race/ethnicity.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S, a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

             "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.  NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum.\r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change.  For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u2020 Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\u00a7 Any species of the family Vibrionaceae, other than toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139.",

Data are obtained on patient characteristics such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and visit characteristics such as patient\u2019s reason for visit, provider\u2019s diagnosis, services ordered or provided, and treatments, including medication therapy. In addition, data about the facility are collected as part of a survey induction interview.",

The first stage consists of a sample of geographically defined areas also known as Primary Sampling Units (PSU). In the second stage, is of hospitals within those PSU and all emergency service areas within the emergency department are selected. Emergency service areas (ESAs) are not sampled at this stage. In the third stage ESAs are sampled.",

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Since [INSERT DATE], XXX influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2017-18 season have been reported.",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week.

More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html.\n\n\u2022 Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions\u2019 data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates.\n\n\u2022 Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories.\n\n\u2022 Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed.\n\n\u2022 Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html.\n\n\u2022 Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)\nand adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.",

             "description": "Nickel is one of the most common contact allergens worldwide. Despite this prevalence, many of the underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for nickel allergy remain unclear. This knowledge gap is partially attributable to the inherent resistance of laboratory rodents (mice and rats) to dermal sensitization with nickel salts. The fundamental goal of this study was to assess the potential utility of the novel humanized Toll-like receptor-4 (hTLR-4) mouse model for use in future in vivo studies of nickel allergy. Accordingly, hTLR-4 positive and negative mice of both sexes were first incorporated into a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) to evaluate dermal sensitization following topical exposure to soluble nickel salts (NiSO4). The ensuing immune responses were then characterized further by incorporating female and male hTLR-4 positive mice into a non-radioactive endpoint-based assay. Utilizing the same exposure scheme as in the LLNA, mice were euthanized following exposure and the auricular lymph nodes, spleen, and blood were collected to assess various immunological parameters associated with allergy and ACD.",

             "description": "Exposure to 4,4\u2019-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the most widely used monomeric diisocyanate, in the occupational setting may lead to the development of occupational asthma (OA). Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI induces OA remain an active area of research. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. Upon exposure to outside stimuli, macrophages are polarized into either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization is associated with asthma development where M2 macrophage populations are usually pronounced in lungs of asthmatic patients. Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that M2 macrophage associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI exposure, indicating that MDI may induce M2 macrophage polarization; however, the underling molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI causes induction of M2 associated markers and chemokines is unclear. M2 macrophage polarization can be regulated by activation of several M2 associated transcription factors; however, whether MDI exposure regulates these transcription factors is unknown. We hypothesize that MDI exposure induces M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines through upregulation of M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in macrophages. The first aim of this study is to verify whether MDI-exposure can induce M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokine expression that were observed in previous studies and to identify candidate M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in response to MDI exposure that may account for the M2 macrophage polarization. After identification of the candidate transcription factor(s) that can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigate the roles of the candidate transcription factor in regulation of these candidate M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

             "description": "Data for CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected \u226514 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19\u2013associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions. Data on cases",

             "description": "Measurement of vapors from solutions containing propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME) released inside a closed chamber were evaluated. Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 \u00b5L and a LOQ of 3.5 \u00b5L was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry\u2019s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ.  Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.",

             "description": "Thermal spray coating involves spraying a product that is melted by extremely high temperatures and then applied under pressure under pressure onto a surface. Large amounts of a complex metal aerosol (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn) are formed during the process, presenting a potentially serious risk to the operator. Information about the health effects associated with exposure to these aerosols is lacking. Even less is known about the chemical and physical properties of these aerosols. The goal was to develop and test an automated thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system that would simulate workplace exposures. An electric arc wire- thermal spray coating aerosol generator and exposure system was designed and separated into two areas: (A) an enclosed room where the spray coating occurs; (B) an exposure chamber with different measurement devices and controllers. The physicochemical properties of aerosols generated during electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using five different consumable wires were examined. The generated particles regardless of composition were poorly soluble, complex metal oxides and mostly arranged as chain-like agglomerates and similar in size distribution as determined by MOUDI and ELPI. To allow for continuous, sequential spray coating during a 4-hr exposure period, a motor rotated the metal pipe to be coated in a circular and up-and-down direction. In a pilot animal study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d) generated from electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using a stainless-steel PMET720 consumable wire. The targeted exposure chamber concentration was achieved and maintained during a 4-hr period. At 1 d after exposure, lung injury and inflammation were significantly elevated in the group exposed to the thermal spray coating aerosol compared to the air control group. A thermal spray coating inhalation system was designed and constructed that will generate continuous metal spray coating aerosols at a targeted concentration for extended periods of time without interruption for future animal exposure studies.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

These data are being presented publicly for the first time this season; further evaluations of these data are underway.\n\n- The pharmacy data include flu vaccinations that were billed for (i.e. claims) or paid by cash. Medical office data are claims based.\n\n- The sampled pharmacies and physician medical offices and the captured volume of transactions represent approximately 92% and 82% of influenza vaccines administered nationally, respectively.\n\n- Vaccinations administered in other settings such as workplaces and community settings are not included in these data.\n\n- Weekly Number of Influenza Vaccinations Administered, in Pharmacies and Physician Medical Offices, Adults 18 years and older, United States, Data Source(s): IQVIA Pharmacy and Physician Medical Office Claims.",

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11\u201312 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

             "description": "We are releasing data that compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of May 15, 2020.  This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS\u2019s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers\u2014including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers\u2014 during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf",

An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series \u226514 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. \nTo estimate the number of unvaccinated persons in each MMWR week, the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates by jurisdiction and age group were used (except for California, where State Department of Finance 2021 population projections were determined to be more accurate). The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. \nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.",

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nAge groups for childhood death rates are based on age at death.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Exposure to WBV has been associated with an increased risk for neck and back pain.  However, the findings of other studies have suggested that occupational exposure to WBV may also serve as a risk factor for the development of a number of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.  In addition, it may result in pre-term births and preclampsia in women and interfere with normal reproductive physiology in both men and women.",

             "description": "Loading-induced hypertrophy with transcriptional upregulation has been observed concomitant with nuclei accretion in various studies regarding both humans and rodents.   Bruusgaard et al. in 2010 pioneered work utilizing a model of synergist ablation to cause hypertrophy followed by denervation-induced atrophy to demonstrate that load-induced gains in myonuclei could be long-lasting after the termination of such exposure.  This finding was consistent with the idea of enduring myonuclear accretion as a form of \u201cmuscle memory\u201d allowing enhanced muscle adaptation following a period of detraining.  Subsequent research groups further investigated this possibility in the context of exercise utilizing rodents and various loaded exercise paradigms such as weighted wheel running and ladder climbing.  This research yielded a spectrum of results.  While these studies were instrumental in highlighting the variation in outcomes possible following load-induced hypertrophy in general, they were limited in their direct relatedness to resistance training \u2013 the predominate form of exposure utilized to induce hypertrophy.  Our research group has established and repeatedly validated a rat research model to investigate resistance-type training.   The model is based on using a dynamometer to precisely expose dorsiflexor muscles of rats to 8 sets of 10 repetitions (per set) of stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs) \u2013 a consecutive sequence of isometric, lengthening, and shortening contractions.  Training with this exposure 3 sessions per week for one month results in increases in muscle mass and performance.  This is accompanied by an increase in muscle fiber area accompanied by a proportional increase in myonuclei number and a rise in overall transcriptional output as measured by total RNA levels.  The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent alterations in performance, muscle mass, nuclei number, and transcriptional output persist several months following the termination of this relevant and valid model of resistance-type training.",

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body.",

             "description": "MMWR Surveillance Summary 66 (No. SS-1):1-8 found that nonmetropolitan areas have significant numbers of potentially excess deaths from the five leading causes of death. These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.\r\n\r\nUnderlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nHeart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20\u2013I51)\r\nCancer (C00\u2013C97)\r\nUnintentional injury (V01\u2013X59 and Y85\u2013Y86)\r\nChronic lower respiratory disease (J40\u2013J47)\r\nStroke (I60\u2013I69)\r\nLocality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s 2013 county-based classification scheme.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nUsers can explore three benchmarks:\r\n\r\n\u201c2010 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.\r\n\u201c2005 Fixed\u201d is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.\r\n\u201cFloating\u201d is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.\r\n \r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia \u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2020 Census place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week.

Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non U.S. residents.\n\nNotes:\n\u2022\tThese are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\nFootnotes:\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.",

PRAMS, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, is a surveillance system collecting state-specific, population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. It is a collaborative project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments. PRAMS provides data for state health officials to use to improve the health of mothers and infants. PRAMS topics include abuse, alcohol use, contraception, breastfeeding, mental health, morbidity, obesity, preconception health, pregnancy history, prenatal-care, sleep behavior, smoke exposure, stress, tobacco use, WIC, Medicaid, infant health, and unintended pregnancy. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022\tThese are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

             "description": "This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2017 release. This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.",

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\nU: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases.

Please refer to the PDF or Excel version of this table in the HUS 2019 Data Finder (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2019.htm) for critical information about measures, definitions, and changes over time. Due to a change in national medical data coding standards in 2015, from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the ICD-10-CM, the definition for injuries and injury subcategories changed for the 2017 reporting period and beyond. Results from 2017 and subsequent years should not be compared with previous reporting periods. Any observed changes in trends across this transition period should not be considered. Data for 2016 are not included. Additional information regarding injury definitions and categorization of injuries by mechanism and intent of injury is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/injury/injury_tools.htm. Note that the data file available here has more recent years of data than what is shown in the PDF or Excel version.\n\nSOURCE: NCHS, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Candida auris, clinical colonization/screening cases are not included in this table. These data are available on the Mycotic Diseases Branch's Tracking Candida auris page (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html).",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.

             "description": "This dataset of U.S. mortality trends since 1900 highlights the differences in age-adjusted death rates and life expectancy at birth by race and sex.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000) after 1998 are calculated based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960. More information on historical data on age-adjusted death rates is available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality/hist293.htm.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

             "description": "A new high-flow, compact aerosol concentrator, using rapid, turbulent mixing to grow aerosol particles into droplets for dry spot sample collection, has been designed and tested. The \u201cTCAC (Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator)\u201d is composed of a saturator for generating hot vapor, a mixing section where the hot vapor mixes with the cold aerosol flow, a growth tube where condensational droplet growth primarily occurs, and a converging nozzle that focuses the droplets into a beam. The prototype concentrator utilizes an aerosol sample flow rate of 4 L min-1. The TCAC was optimized by varying the operating conditions, such as relative humidity of the aerosol flow, mixing flow ratio, vapor temperature, and impaction characteristics. The results showed that particles with a diameter \u2265 25 nm can be grown to a droplet diameter > 1400 nm with near 100 % efficiency. Complete activation and growth were observed at relative humidity \u2265 25 % of the aerosol sample flow. A consistent spot sample with a diameter of D90 = 1.4 mm (the diameter of a circle containing 90 % of the deposited particles) was obtained regardless of the aerosol particle diameter (dp = 20 \u2013 1900 nm). For fiber counting applications using phase contrast microscopy, the TCAC can reduce the sampling time, or counting uncertainty, by two to three orders of magnitude, compared to the 25-mm-filter collection. The study shows that the proposed mixing-flow scheme enables a compact spot sample collector suitable for handheld or portable applications, while still allowing for high flow rates.",

             "description": "Workers across every occupational sector have the potential to be exposed to a wide variety of chemicals, and the skin is a primary route of exposure. Furthermore, exposure to certain chemicals has been linked to inflammatory and allergic diseases. Thus, understanding the immune responses to chemical exposures on the skin and the potential for inflammation and sensitization is needed to improve worker safety and health. Responses in the skin microenvironment impact the potential for sensitization and these responses may include the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammasome activation, barrier integrity, skin microbiota, and the presence of immune cells. Selection of mouse strain to evaluate skin effects, such as haired (BALB/c) or hairless (SKH1) mice, varies dependent on the experimental design and needs of a study. However, dermal chemical exposure may impact reactions in the skin differently depending on the strain of mouse. Additionally, there is a need for established methods to evaluate immune responses in the skin. In this study, exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan was evaluated in two mouse models using immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis.  The flow cytometry panel reported in this manuscript in combination with gene expression analysis may be used in future studies to better evaluate the effect of chemical exposures on the skin immune response.  These findings may be important to consider during strain selection, experimental design, and result interpretation of chemical exposures on the skin.",

             "description": "CDC is collaborating with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Vitalant Research Institute (VRI), Westat Inc., and numerous blood collection organizations across the United States to conduct a nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey of blood donors. This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The term \u201ccombined seroprevalence\u201d refers to the combined infection- and vaccination-induced SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalences. This is the population that has  anti-S antibodies, regardless of the presence of anti-N antibodies.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey. It offers an interactive visualization available at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#nationwide-blood-donor-seroprevalence\n\nAdditional information is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/blood-bank-serosurvey.html",

All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Patient and Cycle Characteristics dataset summarizes the types of ART services performed and the kinds of patients who received ART procedures in a specific clinic. Please note patient characteristics are presented per cycle rather than per patient. As a result, patients who had more than one ART cycle within the reporting year are represented more than once.",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

             "description": "SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by droplets and aerosols expelled by infected people when they cough, talk, sing, or exhale. To reduce exposure to these droplets and aerosols while indoors, CDC recommends measures including physical distancing, universal mask wearing, and room ventilation. Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable air cleaners to remove infectious material from the air more quickly and provide greater protection. We conducted a case study using respiratory simulators to examine the efficacy of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles from an infected meeting participant in a conference room. We found that, in a room with good air mixing, the use of two HEPA air cleaners meeting the EPA recommended Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) reduced the overall exposure by up to 65%, and that the combination of the HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%. The air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. Our results demonstrate that portable HEPA cleaners can be an effective method to reduce exposure to airborne particles while meeting indoors, especially in combination with universal masking.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week.

This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

This study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) and National Environmental Assessment Reporting System (NEARS) to identify outbreak investigation characteristics associated with outbreak investigation success. We identified investigation characteristics that increase the probability of successful outbreak investigations: a robust epidemiology investigation method; a thorough environmental assessment, as measured by number of visits to complete the assessment; and the collection of clinical samples. This research highlights the importance of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, which includes epidemiology, environmental health, and laboratory personnel working together to solve the outbreak.",

Note that if additional data points did not meet the criteria for statistical reliability, data quality, or confidentiality, the objective was categorized as baseline only. \n\n6 - Informational\u2014A target was not set for this objective, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed.\n\n\n[2] The final value is generally based on data available on the Healthy People 2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. \n\n\n[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): \n\nPercentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100\n\n\n[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: \n\nMagnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100\n\n\n[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test. \n\n\n[6] For more information on the Healthy People 2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/sta",

The statuses used in Healthy People 2020 were: \n\n1 - Target met or exceeded\u2014One of the following applies: (i) At baseline, the target was not met or exceeded, and the most recent value was equal to or exceeded the target. (The percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%.); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target. (The percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed.) \n\n2 - Improved\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.\n\n3 - Little or no detectable change\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.\n\n4 - Got worse\u2014One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.\n\n5 - Baseline only\u2014The objective only had one data point, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed. Note that if additional data points did not meet the criteria for statistical reliability, data quality, or confidentiality, the objective was categorized as baseline only. \n\n6 - Informational\u2014A target was not set for this objective, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed.\n\n\n[2] The final value is generally based on data available on the Healthy People 2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. \n\n\n[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): \n\nPercentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100\n\n\n[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: \n\nMagnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100\n\n\n[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test. \n\n\n[6] For more information on the Healthy People 2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/sta",

PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA are short-chain PFAS (C7, C6, C5, respectively) that have been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects.  This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams.  There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, short-chain PFAS have been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking.  In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory.  Also, the short-chain PFAS, PFBA, was found to have systemic toxic effects on mice with dermal exposure.  In the present study, the systemic toxicity of a 28-day dermal PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA (1.25-5% w/v or v/v, or 31.25-125 mg/kg/dose) exposure was evaluated in a murine model.",

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.

             "description": "NNDSS - In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022 These are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-disease/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data.\n\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-disease/notice-to-data-users.html.\n\n\u2022 The list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2024 and 2025 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\n\u2022 Please refer to the Stacks publication for weekly updates to the footnote for influenza-associated pediatric mortality.\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

             "description": "This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

To investigate the potential exposure threshold and dose-response for tumor promotion by this MWCNT, 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) initiated (10 \u03bcg/g, i.p., once) or vehicle (corn oil) treated B6C3F1 mice were exposed by inhalation to filtered air or MWCNT (5 mg/m3) for 5 hours/day for 0, 2, 5, or 10 days and were followed for 17 months  post-exposure for evidence of lung tumors.",

The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act or PPPHCEA (P.L. 116-139) appropriated an additional $75 billion for relief funds, and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act appropriated an additional $3 billion.  HRSA established the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to administer payments to eligible providers. A portion of the PRF funds are being used to provide reimbursement to providers for administering Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID-19 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines under a Biologics License Application (BLA) to underinsured individuals. To learn more about the program, visit: https://www.hrsa.gov/covid19-coverage-assistance\n\nThis dataset represents the list of health care entities who have agreed to the Terms and Conditions and received claims reimbursement for costs associated with administering COVID-19 vaccines to underinsured individuals.\n\nFor Provider Relief Fund Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/HHS-Provider-Relief-Fund/kh8y-3es6",

             "description": "This data presents provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\n\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm",

             "description": "Effective September 27, 2023, this dataset will no longer be updated. Similar data are accessible from wonder.cdc.gov.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can provide information about the burden of mortality potentially related to COVID-19, beyond the number of deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19. Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.",

HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.  Blood flow (laser doppler) and sensitivity of the tail to pressure (Randall-Selitto pressure test) was measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of the exposure.  The sensitivity of the tail nerves to electrical stimulation was measured on days 2 and 9.",

To study the mechanisms of these disorders, a new rat-tail model has been established to mimic the finger pressure and vibration exposures. However, the mechanical behavior of the tail during compression needs to be better understood to improve the model and its applications. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the static and time-dependent force responses of the rat tail during compression. Compression tests were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley cadaver rat tails using a micromechanical testing system at three deformation velocities and three deformation magnitudes. Contact-width, and the time-histories of force and deformation were measured. Additionally, force-relaxation tests were conducted and a Prony series was used to model the force-relaxation behavior of the tail.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Since [INSERT DATE], XXX influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2017-18 season have been reported.",

The weekly cumulatve COVID-19 \u2013associated hospitalization estimates are preliminary, and use reported weekly hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The data are updated week-by-week as new COVID-19 hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the COVID-NET system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of COVID-19 -associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7]. \n \n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent COVID-19-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

Obesity, affecting over 40% of American adults, disrupts adipocyte metabolism leading to chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction (MetDys). MetDys is associated with impaired lung function, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of silica inhalation in a pre-existing MetDys animal model to determine if an occupational exposure of silica dust has the potential to initiate or further the progression of MetDys associated conditions.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotes:\n\n\u2022\tThese are weekly cases of selected infectious national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables available at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/data-statistics/index.html. Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are subject to ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Therefore, numbers listed in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Case counts in the tables are presented as published each week. See also Guide to Interpreting Provisional and Finalized NNDSS Data at https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2022 Notices, errata, and other notes are available in the Notice To Data Users page at https://wonder.cdc.gov/nndss/NTR.html.\n\u2022\tThe list of national notifiable infectious diseases and conditions and their national surveillance case definitions are available at https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/. This list incorporates the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) position statements approved by CSTE for national surveillance.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n*Case counts for reporting years 2021 and 2022 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/docs/Readers-Guide-WONDER-Tables-20210421-508.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\nU: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. Med: Median. Max: Maximum. \r\n\r\n* Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.\r\n \r\n\u2020 Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change.

Forty of the 71 measurements were collected with the participants in fitted shorts in both standing and seated postures. Twenty-one of the 71 measurements were collected while the participants were wearing their personal turnout gear, including personal selection of tools stored in their pockets, in both standing and seated postures. Ten of the 71 measurements were hand- and head/face-related dimensions extracted from hand and head/face scans.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.

             "description": "Workers that regularly use vibrating hand tools as part of their job are at risk of developing hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS).  HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms that result in blanching of the fingers and hands, loss of sensation, pain, and reductions in manual dexterity, all of which can affect a worker\u2019s ability to perform their job and their quality of life.  Vibration exposure significantly contributes to the development of these symptoms by increasing the stress and strain within exposed tissues, which in turn can affect functioning of blood vessels, nerves and sensory receptors in those tissues.",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2020 or 2019 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2016\u20132020 or 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2020 or 2019 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2016\u20132020 or 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2020 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

             "description": "NNDSS - TABLE 1Q. Hepatitis B, perinatal infection to Hepatitis C, acute, Probable - 2020. In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 For acute Hepatitis C, only confirmed cases were verified.",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change.

             "description": "In the oil and gas industry, workers are potentially exposed to crude oil or crude oil vapor (COV) during upstream (drilling and extraction), midstream (transportation and storage), as well as downstream (refining) activities.  Worker exposure to various fractions of crude oil have been linked to mortality, as well as musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory problems, and cancer.  During the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, response workers were exposed to a variety of chemical hazards including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, as well as components of the oil dispersants employed to disperse the oil.  The Gulf Long-term Follow-up (GuLF) STUDY had reported that workers involved in the cleanup operations experienced adverse hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac problems.  However, long-term neurological effects remain unknown.\n\nHealth Hazard Evaluation (HHE) surveys conducted by NIOSH among the cleanup workers identified a variety of health effects, including neurological symptoms.  Unfortunately, as a significant number of response workers who experienced health symptoms were exposed to both crude oil and the oil dispersant that was aerially sprayed to the contain the spill, the health effects of crude oil exposures alone were difficult to discern from these surveys.  It is here that laboratory-based studies are advantageous as they can provide ample health risk information to establish the toxicological potential of the various chemical hazards at the workplace.  To that end, the present work evaluated the neurotoxic risks of COV generated from the Macondo well crude oil that was used as a surrogate for the DWH crude oil.",

The Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector (HCSA) has one of the highest incidence of allergic disease compared to other industrial sectors. Individuals in this sector are frequently exposed to a variety of high-level cleaners and disinfectants along with antiseptics for the purposes of sterilization of surfaces, medical and surgical instruments, and reducing the incidence of nosocomial infections.  The range of specificity and effectiveness of these agents is very diverse based on the type of chemical used.  Commonly used antimicrobials include: alcohol, chlorine, iodine based agents; phenols; hydrogen peroxide; and quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC).   While the importance of these kinds of chemicals is understood, many of these agents are also known to directly contribute to allergic disease.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the Census tract 2022 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.",

             "description": "SARS-CoV-2 spreads by infectious aerosols and droplets expelled from the respiratory tract. Masks and respirators can reduce the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking these aerosols and droplets at the source. The ability of source control devices to block aerosols can be tested by expelling an aerosol through a headform wearing the device. These tests may be performed using constant airflows, which are simpler, or cyclic airflows, which are more realistic but require more complex methods. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the results found using constant vs. cyclic airflows.\n\nA source control measurement system was used to measure the efficacy of two cloth face masks, two medical masks with and without an elastic mask brace, a neck gaiter, and an N95 respirator as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols. With this system, the aerosol flows from the inside of the mask toward the outside; that is, the aerosol flows in the same direction as it would flow during an exhalation by a person wearing the source control device. The experiments were conducted under four airflow conditions: cyclic breathing at 15 liters/minute (L/min), cyclic breathing at 85 L/min, constant outward airflow at 15 L/min, and constant outward airflow at 85 L/min. Each experiment began by placing the source control device on the headform and performing a fit test. The measurement system collection chamber was then sealed, and the cyclic or constant airflow and the aerosol generation were initiated. The aerosol concentration in the collection chamber was measured using an optical particle spectrometer (OPS). The source control collection efficiency was determined by comparing the steady-state concentration of aerosol particles in the collection chamber when the source control device was worn with the concentration when no source control device was used.",

These data are voluntarily reported to NHSN as of May 1, 2024 until November 1, 2024, at which time CMS will require acute care and critical access hospitals to electronically report information via NHSN about COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV, hospital bed census and capacity, and limited patient demographic information, including age. Data for collection dates prior to May 1, 2024, represent data reported during a previously mandated reporting period as specified by the HHS Secretary. Data for collection dates May 1, 2024, and onwards represent data reported voluntarily to NHSN; as such, data included represents reporting hospitals only for a given week and might not be complete or representative of all hospitals. NHSN monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress and capacity for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States. Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.  NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum.\r\n\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change.   For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u2020 Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. \r\n\u00a7 Includes drug resistant and susceptible cases of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease. This condition was previously named Streptococcus pneumoniae invasive disease and cases were reported to CDC using different event codes to specify whether the cases were drug resistant or in a defined age group, such as <5 years.",

             "description": "This file contains COVID-19 death counts and rates by month and year of death, jurisdiction of residence (U.S., HHS Region) and demographic characteristics (sex, age, race and Hispanic origin, and age/race and Hispanic origin). United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia.\n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD\u201310 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly.\n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).",

These data tables consist of 34 traditional semi-nude body dimensions without gear (e.g., chest depth, standing; foot breadth, horizontal, standing; hip circumference; stature; elbow rest height, sitting; and eye height, sitting) and 15 dimension measurements over clothing and with gear (e.g., abdominal extension depth, sitting; hip breadth, sitting; and should-grip length, sitting) of 756 male and 218 female Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs). For many LEOs, patrol vehicles are the workplace where they spend significant portions of their workday and PPE is vital gear to safeguard LEOs from the harm of assaults. Design improvements of vehicle console space, vehicle ingress/egress, and LEO body-worn equipment can result in reduced LEO fatigue, pain, or injury.",

             "description": "<b>Note:</b> \nThe cumulative case count for some counties (with small population) is higher than expected due to the inclusion of non-permanent residents in COVID-19 case counts. \n\nReporting of Aggregate Case and Death Count data was discontinued on May 11, 2023, with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported through a robust process with the following steps:</b><ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration. CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>Cases and deaths are based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in this data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data were organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts were calculated as the week-to-week change in reported cumulative cases and deaths (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the week before.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues. CDC also worked with jurisdictions after the end of the public health emergency declaration to finalize county data. \n<ul><li><b>Source:</b> The weekly archived dataset is based on county-level aggregate count data</li><li><b>Confirmed/Probable Cases/Death breakdown:</b> Cumulative cases and deaths for each county are included.  Total reported cases include probable and confirmed cases.</li><li><b>Time Series Frequency:</b> The weekly archived dataset contains weekly time series data (i.e., one record per week per county)</li></ul>\n \n<b>Important note:</b> The counts reflected during a given time period in this dataset may not match the counts reflected for the same time period in the daily archived dataset noted above. Discrepancies may exist due to differences between county and state COVID-19 case surveillance and reconciliation efforts.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implement these case classifications. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<b>Confirmed and Probable Counts</b>\nIn this dataset, counts by jurisdiction are not displayed by confirmed or probable status. Instead, counts of confirmed and probable cases and deaths are included in the Total Cases and Total Deaths columns, when available. Not all jurisdictions report",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.",

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from VSP, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. VSP claims for VEHSS provides a convenience sample of vision insurance members representing approximately more than 1 in 4 of the U.S. population. VSP uses a web-based claims submissions system to collect and process claims. The denominator of the rates represents persons with VSP benefits as reported by employers, and is subject to some uncertainty.  VSP data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Eye Health Condition indicators.  Certain ophthalmic conditions and procedures are covered by health insurance and are not covered by managed vision insurance, claims based eye disease prevalence may therefore be expected to undercount true prevalence.  Person level claims and person counts are not publically available.  Reported rates were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Detailed information on VEHSS VSP analyses can be found on the VEHSS VSP webpage (link). Information on VSP data can be found on the VSP website (www.vsp.com).

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from Medicare claims, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and state. Medicare claims for VEHSS includes beneficiaries who were fully enrolled in Medicare Part B Fee-for-Service (FFS) for the duration of the year. Medicare claims provide a convenience sample that includes approximately 30 million individuals annually, which represents nearly 89% of the US population aged 65 and older and 3.3% of the US population younger than 65, including persons disabled due to blindness. Medicare data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Medical Diagnoses indicators. Data were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS Medicare analyses can be found on the VEHSS Medicare webpage (cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/claims/medicare.html). Information on available Medicare claims data can be found on the ResDac website (www.resdac.org). The VEHSS Medicare dataset was last updated May 2023.",

From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: \u201cAre you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?\u201d The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs.

Rows with Subgroup = \u2018Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.\n\n\nAge Related Macular Degeneration:\nThe age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = \u2018Age Related Macular Degeneration\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening AMD\u2019 includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen \u2265125 \u00b5m in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.\n\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy:\nThe diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Diabetic Eye Diseases\u2019.  The Subgroup \u2018Vision threatening DR\u2019 includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision threatening DR\u2019 is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.\n\n\nGlaucoma:\nThe glaucoma estimates represent glaucoma as measured with retinal imaging examination and are included in rows where Category=\u2019Glaucoma\u2019. The Subgroup \u2018Vision affecting glaucoma\u2019 includes people with glaucoma and abnormal visual field. The Subgroup \u2018Non-vision affecting glaucoma\u2019 is defined as people with glaucoma without an abnormal visual field.\n\n\nAge Groups:\nThe VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text \u201cby detailed age groups\u201d in the \u2018Indicator\u2019 field. \n\n\nPrevalence Data Type:\nThese estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = \u2018Crude Prevalence\u2019) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=\u2019Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and gender.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.\n\n  \nData Sources:\nData sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance",

COVID-19 vaccination coverage for pregnant women is available here.\n\n\u2022 Figure 3A. Monthly Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage*, by Flu Season and Race/Ethnicity, Pregnant Women 18-49 years, United States, Data Source: Vaccine Safety Datalink\n\n\u2022 Figure 3B. Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage*, by Month, Flu Season, and Race/Ethnicity, Pregnant Women 18-49 years, United States, Data Source: Vaccine Safety Datalink\n\n\u2022 For any month\u2019s coverage estimate, the denominator is the number of women with a pregnancy during the current flu season (defined as August through March) beginning before or during the specified month. The numerator is the subset of the denominator who have received flu vaccination prior to, during, or after pregnancy. The denominator increases as more women are identified as pregnant or having been pregnant during the flu season. Cumulative vaccination coverage for one month may be lower than cumulative coverage for a previous month due to addition to the denominator of women who are less likely to have received vaccination.",

COVID-19 vaccination coverage for pregnant persons is available here. \n\n\u2022\tFigure 3A.

Cumulative Influenza Vaccination Coverage*, by Month, Flu Season, and Race/Ethnicity, Pregnant Persons 18-49 years, United States, Data Source: Vaccine Safety Datalink \n\n\u2022\tFor any month\u2019s coverage estimate, the denominator is the number of persons with a pregnancy during the current flu season (defined as August through March) beginning before or during the specified month. The numerator is the subset of the denominator who have received flu vaccination prior to, during, or after pregnancy. The denominator increases as more persons are identified as pregnant or having been pregnant during the flu season. Cumulative vaccination coverage for one month may be lower than cumulative coverage for a previous month due to addition to the denominator of persons who are less likely to have received vaccination.",
