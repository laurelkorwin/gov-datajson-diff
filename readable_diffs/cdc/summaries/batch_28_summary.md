Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reorganization of metadata structure across multiple dataset entries
- Addition of new fields and values for several datasets
- Updates to dates, particularly in modified/issued fields
- Standardization of distribution format descriptions
- Addition of more detailed keyword lists and references

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution entries now consistently lead with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" before other properties
- Media type declarations are consistently moved to end of distribution blocks
- Publisher names standardized to either "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" or specific divisions

Added Terms:
- New standardized fields like "accrualPeriodicity" and "language"
- Additional metadata fields like "identifier", "landingPage", "spatial"
- More comprehensive keyword lists

Modified Descriptions:
- More structured and detailed dataset descriptions
- Standardized reference formatting
- More consistent URL formatting

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within objects are now more consistently ordered
- Distribution blocks follow a standard format across all entries
- Better separation of metadata components with consistent grouping
- More complete metadata with additional fields added systematically
- Standardized format for dates and URLs
- More structured approach to listing keywords and references

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize metadata formatting and enhance dataset documentation across the CDC's data catalog. There's a clear move toward more consistent and complete metadata records while maintaining the core information about each dataset.
