Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes primarily involve reordering and restructuring of JSON metadata entries
- No content is being removed or added, rather the same information is being reorganized
- The changes affect multiple dataset entries in the CDC's data catalog
- Distribution format information and metadata fields are being standardized

2. Terminology Pattern Changes:
- Consistent reordering of fields to put "@type" at the beginning of objects
- Media type declarations are being moved after their corresponding descriptive fields
- Distribution array entries are being reorganized to group related fields together
- No actual terminology changes - the same terms are being used, just in a different order

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Fields within dataset objects are being alphabetized
- Distribution array entries are being restructured to follow a consistent pattern:
  - @type field first
  - describedBy and describedByType fields grouped together
  - downloadURL and mediaType fields grouped together
- Publisher and contact information blocks are being moved to later positions in the objects
- Metadata fields like "identifier", "issued", "modified" etc. are being grouped together
- Theme and title fields are being moved to the end of dataset objects

The changes appear to be an automated reorganization to standardize the structure and ordering of the metadata, while preserving all the actual content. This type of change often helps with consistency and machine readability of the data catalog.
