Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reorganization of metadata structure for multiple CDC datasets
- Consistent reordering of properties within dataset objects
- Addition of new properties and standardization of existing ones
- Updates to distribution format descriptions and URLs

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution object properties are consistently reordered to put "@type" first
- Media type declarations moved to end of distribution objects
- Download URLs and media types are consistently paired together

Added Terms:
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" added consistently to dataset entries
- "accrualPeriodicity" added to several datasets
- "language" arrays added to some datasets

Modified References:
- More structured organization of publisher information
- Standardized format for contact point information
- Consistent handling of temporal and spatial coverage data

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within dataset objects are now consistently ordered alphabetically
- Distribution arrays are structured more uniformly
- Contact information is standardized across datasets
- More consistent formatting of dates and temporal information
- Better organization of related properties (e.g., grouping all distribution-related fields together)

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the metadata structure and improve consistency across CDC dataset descriptions. The modifications focus on better organization and more standardized formatting rather than changing the underlying data content.
