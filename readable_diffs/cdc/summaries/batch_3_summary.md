Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON structure with consistent property ordering
- Addition of new metadata fields for some datasets
- Standardization of distribution object formatting
- Updates to temporal and spatial coverage information
- Modifications to contact information and publisher details

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution format descriptions are standardized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" consistently added
- Media type declarations are moved to end of distribution objects
- Publisher organizations are consistently formatted with "@type": "org:Organization"

Added Terms:
- "accrualPeriodicity" field added to several datasets
- "language" field standardized to include array format
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" consistently added at start of records

Removed/Modified Terms:
- Some "temporal" fields updated or removed
- Publisher names standardized between "CDC", "data.cdc.gov" and full organization names

3. Structural Changes:
- Property ordering is standardized across all dataset entries
- Distribution objects follow consistent internal structure
- Contact information blocks standardized format
- Nested objects (publisher, contactPoint) have consistent structure
- Properties are alphabetically ordered within each dataset object

The changes appear focused on standardizing the format and structure of the metadata while maintaining the core content. There's a clear effort to make the JSON structure more consistent and predictable across different datasets.
