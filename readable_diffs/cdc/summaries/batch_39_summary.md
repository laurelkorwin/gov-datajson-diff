Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata structure for multiple CDC datasets
- Consistent reordering of fields within dataset descriptions
- Standardization of distribution format descriptions
- Addition of missing fields and properties to dataset metadata

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent replacement of individual media type/download URL entries with standardized "@type": "dcat:Distribution" blocks
- More structured organization of distribution metadata with consistent field ordering
- Standardization of property names and values across datasets

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties are now consistently ordered alphabetically within each dataset description
- Distribution blocks are now formatted consistently with the same property order:
  ```json
  {
    "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
    "describedBy": "...",
    "describedByType": "...",
    "downloadURL": "...",
    "mediaType": "..."
  }
  ```
- Dataset metadata blocks follow a more consistent structure with properties like:
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - distribution
  - identifier
  - keyword
  - etc.

The changes appear focused on improving consistency and standardization in how dataset metadata is structured and formatted, while maintaining the same core information. This type of standardization would make the data more maintainable and easier to process programmatically.
