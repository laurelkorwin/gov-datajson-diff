Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata structure for multiple CDC datasets
- Consistent reordering of properties within dataset objects
- Addition of new datasets and their associated metadata
- Updates to distribution format specifications

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent Property Ordering:
  - "@type" is consistently moved to the top of dataset objects
  - Distribution properties are reordered in a consistent pattern (describedBy, describedByType, downloadURL, mediaType)
  - Contact information and publisher details follow a standardized format

- Format Specifications:
  - Media types are consistently specified (application/rdf+xml, application/json, application/xml, text/csv)
  - Distribution types consistently use "dcat:Distribution"

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Property Grouping:
  - Related properties are grouped together (e.g., all distribution-related properties)
  - Metadata properties follow a more consistent alphabetical ordering
  - Contact information and publisher details are structured more consistently

- Distribution Format:
  - Each dataset's distribution information is formatted in a consistent pattern
  - Distribution objects maintain consistent internal property ordering

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the format and structure of CDC dataset metadata, making it more consistent and easier to maintain. The modifications focus on organizing properties in a predictable way while maintaining the same core information about each dataset.

The most significant change is the consistent reordering of properties rather than changes to the actual content, suggesting this was primarily a structural reorganization effort rather than a content update.
