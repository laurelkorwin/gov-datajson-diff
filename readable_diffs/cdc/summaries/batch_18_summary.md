Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes appear to be reorganizing and standardizing the structure of dataset metadata entries
- Most changes involve reordering existing properties rather than adding/removing content
- The format of distribution entries has been standardized
- Property order has been made consistent across entries

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent standardization of distribution object structure:
  - Added "@type": "dcat:Distribution" consistently
  - Reordered properties within distribution objects
  - Standardized order: describedBy, describedByType, downloadURL, mediaType

- No significant changes to actual terminology or vocabulary
- Property names and values remain largely unchanged
- Consistent use of existing terms across entries

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties reordered into a consistent pattern across all dataset entries:
  - @type and accessLevel appear first
  - Contact information grouped together
  - Distribution arrays formatted consistently
  - Publisher information positioned similarly
  - Theme and title at the end

- Distribution object properties standardized:
  - Added explicit @type declaration
  - Properties ordered consistently
  - Format made uniform across all entries

- Overall more consistent and predictable structure while maintaining same content
- Focus appears to be on standardization rather than content changes

The changes seem aimed at improving consistency and maintainability of the metadata structure rather than modifying the actual content or terminology used to describe the datasets.
