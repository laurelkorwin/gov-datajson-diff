Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reordering of metadata fields within dataset entries
- Consistent alphabetical ordering of properties being implemented
- Addition of new fields like "accrualPeriodicity" and "rights" to some entries
- Updates to temporal ranges and modification dates
- Standardization of distribution format descriptions

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution format descriptions are standardized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" consistently added
- Media type descriptions are made more consistent across entries

Added Terms:
- "accrualPeriodicity" field added to multiple entries
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" consistently added at the start of entries

Modified References:
- Publisher organizations are more specifically defined
- More detailed contact information provided

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within each dataset entry are now consistently alphabetically ordered
- Distribution arrays are structured more consistently with standardized format
- Metadata fields are grouped more logically (e.g., identification fields together, distribution details together)
- More consistent formatting of nested objects and arrays
- Better organization of temporal and spatial metadata

The changes appear focused on standardizing the format and structure of the dataset metadata while maintaining the core content. The modifications seem aimed at improving consistency and machine-readability of the data.
