Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reorganization of dataset metadata entries
- Consistent reformatting of distribution entries
- Addition of new fields and standardization of existing fields
- Updates to dataset descriptions and metadata structure

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution entries now consistently include "@type": "dcat:Distribution" at the start
- Media type declarations are moved to end of distribution blocks
- "mediaType" field is consistently placed after "downloadURL"

Added Terms:
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" is consistently added to dataset entries
- "accrualPeriodicity" field added to some datasets
- "language" field added to some entries

Modified References:
- URLs and identifiers are standardized
- Publisher information is structured more consistently

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:

- Distribution blocks are reorganized with consistent field ordering:
  - @type
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType

- Dataset metadata fields are reordered consistently:
  - @type first
  - accessLevel near top
  - contact information grouped together
  - identifiers and URLs grouped
  - dates (issued/modified) grouped
  - descriptive fields (title, description) grouped

- More structured organization of related fields (e.g., grouping all distribution-related fields together)

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize metadata formatting and structure across CDC datasets while maintaining the same core information.
