Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes primarily involve reorganization and standardization of metadata structure for CDC datasets
- Multiple dataset entries are being reformatted while maintaining the same core information
- The order of metadata fields is being standardized across entries

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent reordering of fields with "@type" moving to the top of each dataset entry
- Distribution entries are being standardized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" consistently added
- Media type declarations are being moved inside distribution objects rather than as standalone properties
- The order of fields is being standardized (e.g., identifier, issued, keyword, landingPage, etc.)

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Fields are being reordered in a consistent pattern across all dataset entries
- Distribution objects are being restructured to include type declarations
- The overall JSON structure is being made more consistent across different dataset entries
- Property ordering is being standardized with a clear hierarchy:
  - Basic metadata (@type, accessLevel) first
  - Contact information
  - Core dataset properties (description, distribution)
  - Additional metadata (keywords, dates, etc.)
  - Publishing information
  - Theme and classification data

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the metadata structure and improve consistency across CDC dataset descriptions while maintaining the same fundamental information. The modifications are primarily organizational rather than content-based.
