Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata fields within dataset entries
- Addition of new fields like "mediaType" to distribution objects
- Consistent reordering of properties to follow a more standardized structure
- Updates to dataset identifiers, keywords, and other metadata values

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent addition of "@type" field at the beginning of distribution objects
- Standardization of media type declarations (moving from inline to separate "mediaType" field)
- More structured organization of distribution metadata with consistent property ordering
- Addition of health-related keywords like "risk" and "status" in some datasets

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Reordering of properties to follow a more consistent pattern:
  - "@type" typically appears at the start of objects
  - Core metadata (identifier, title, description) grouped together
  - Distribution information organized more consistently
  - Contact and publisher information grouped together
- More structured organization of distribution objects with standardized property ordering
- Better separation of concerns between different types of metadata (administrative, technical, descriptive)

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the metadata structure and improve consistency across dataset descriptions. The modifications focus on:
- Better organization of metadata fields
- More consistent property ordering
- Clearer separation of different types of metadata
- Standardization of distribution object structure
- Addition of missing fields and properties for completeness

These changes suggest an effort to improve the machine-readability and consistency of the dataset metadata while maintaining the same core information.
