Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata structure for multiple CDC datasets
- Addition of new fields and standardization of existing fields
- Consistent reordering of properties within dataset descriptions
- Updates to dataset access information and distribution formats

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent reordering of properties to follow "@type" first, followed by other metadata fields
- Standardization of media type declarations (moving from inline to structured format)
- Distribution formats are consistently organized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" appearing first
- Consistent structure for contact points using "vcard:Contact" format

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties are now alphabetically ordered within each dataset description
- Distribution information is more consistently structured across datasets
- Added standardized fields like "identifier", "issued", and "modified" across datasets
- More structured organization of license and rights information
- Better organization of temporal and spatial coverage information

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the metadata structure across CDC datasets, making it more consistent with DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary) standards. The modifications improve machine-readability while maintaining human-readable organization of the information.

The reorganization follows a clear pattern of placing core identifying information first, followed by descriptive metadata, and then technical details about data distribution. This makes the metadata more consistent and easier to process programmatically.
