Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata structure for multiple CDC datasets
- Consistent reordering of fields within dataset entries
- Addition of new fields and removal of obsolete ones
- Updates to distribution format descriptions
- Standardization of field ordering across entries

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Media type declarations are moved from standalone properties to nested "@type": "dcat:Distribution" blocks
- Distribution URLs are consistently restructured with more detailed metadata

Added Terms:
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" is consistently added at the start of dataset entries
- More structured distribution metadata with standardized fields

Removed/Modified Terms:
- Standalone mediaType declarations removed in favor of nested structure
- Some temporal and spatial coverage information reorganized

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:

Field Ordering:
- Fields are consistently reordered to follow a standard pattern:
  - @type
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - distribution
  - identifier
  - other metadata fields

Distribution Format:
- Distribution information is restructured into a more detailed format with:
  - @type
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType

Metadata Organization:
- More consistent hierarchical structure
- Better organized metadata fields
- Standardized order of fields across dataset entries
- More complete dataset descriptions and metadata

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize and improve the structure and completeness of CDC dataset metadata while maintaining consistent formatting across entries.
