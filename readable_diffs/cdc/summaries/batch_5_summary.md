Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Significant restructuring of JSON data format and organization
- Addition of new metadata fields and standardization of existing ones
- Updates to dataset descriptions, licenses, and contact information
- Reorganization of distribution information and media types

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution format descriptions are standardized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution" consistently added
- Media type declarations are moved into standardized structure
- Download URLs and media types are consistently paired together

Added Terms:
- "landingPage" field added to multiple entries
- "license" field standardized across entries
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" consistently added to entries

Modified Descriptions:
- More structured format for describing data sources and methodologies
- Standardized format for contact information using vcard:Contact type
- More detailed temporal coverage information

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:

- Consistent ordering of fields within each dataset entry:
  * Basic metadata (@type, accessLevel, bureauCode) first
  * Contact information
  * Description and distribution details
  * Identifiers and dates
  * Keywords and themes last

- Distribution information reorganized into more structured format with consistent fields:
  * downloadURL
  * mediaType
  * describedBy
  * describedByType

- More standardized approach to metadata with consistent field ordering and formatting across all entries

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize the data catalog format and improve metadata consistency across datasets.
