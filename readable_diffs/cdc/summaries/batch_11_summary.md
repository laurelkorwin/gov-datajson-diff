Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties to follow a more consistent alphabetical ordering
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Addition of "@type" field consistently across distribution objects
- Reordering of metadata fields within dataset entries
- Removal of some programCode entries
- Consistent formatting of media type and distribution information

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent addition of "@type": "dcat:Distribution" to distribution objects
- Standardization of distribution object structure with fields in order:
  - @type
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType
- More consistent ordering of top-level fields like "accessLevel", "bureauCode", etc.

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties within objects are now consistently ordered alphabetically
- Distribution arrays now have a more standardized structure
- Each distribution object follows the same pattern of field ordering
- Metadata fields are organized more consistently across dataset entries
- The overall structure maintains hierarchical relationships but with more standardized ordering

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the format and structure of the data rather than changing the actual content. This suggests an effort to improve consistency and maintainability of the dataset metadata.
