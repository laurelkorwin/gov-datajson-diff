+            "description": "This study of prison rapes used an ethnographic, culturally\r\n relativistic methodology and was conducted between April 2004 and\r\n September 2005. The study was conducted in 30 correctional\r\n institutions, 23 men's and 7 women's, in 10 states. All 23 men's\r\n institutions were the highest-security level men's prison available in\r\n each state. When women's institutions were multi-security level and\r\n housed minimum, medium, and high-security inmates, they were selected\r\n from the highest-security level housing units within the institution.\r\n A total of 564 (409 male and 155 female) inmates were interviewed. The\r\n inmates to be interviewed were selected from the general prison\r\n population using a probability sample design. Average interview length\r\n was just under an hour. The sole mode of data collection was an\r\n open-ended, semistructured inmate interview. To ensure comparability\r\n of answers, surveys were designed with each query resting on a\r\n particular concept or variable. The same interview instrument was used\r\n for both male and female inmates. Questions were asked about inmate\r\n prison history, mental health, rape, social process, domestic violence\r\n and relationships, staff, institutional factors, and perception of\r\n social roles, and demographic information. Also included are lexical\r\n responses and free list questions such as \"Why do inmates have sex\r\nwith other inmates?\"",

On the front end, CWS agencies were sent an overview letter about the study.  Initial contacts were interviewed and, if appropriate, were asked to nominate and facilitate introductions to other contacts to locate the best informant for each interview domain.  Each CWS informant then was asked to provide contact information for the local provider(s) of DVS, including a contact name, if possible. Data from these respondents was used to assess interagency agreement on local policies and practices.\r\nIdentified DVS representative agencies then received the same introductory letters about the study sent to the CWS agencies. A snowball interviewing technique was again used to identify informants in each agency who would be best able to answer questions regarding related services.\r\nThe key informants from both the CWS and DVS agencies received additional information on the study, an interview summary, and a copy of the informed consent agreement.\r\nInterview data then were collected from CWS and DVS agency informants by telephone.\r\nThis process began in January 2003 and was completed in February 2004.  The need for multiple informants to complete different survey modules for each agency resulted in a total of 860 interviews with 406 interviewees.  The data file contains 89 cases and 1,209 variables where each case represents an agency.  The measures for CADVS were an amalgamation of (1) child, caregiver and family measures collected in NSCAW and (2) contextual data on policy/practices collected through surveys of states, counties, and localities developed for this particular study.\r\nThese include such issues as funding, policies regarding the reporting of child maltreatment, referrals made regarding the domestic violence victim or her children, what services are available for children of domestic violence victims, types of service providers, locations of mental and physical health evaluations, and types of training which CWS and DVS staff received.",

The psychometric properties of the newly developed coercive control measure were assessed between February and September 2004 in a total sample of 757 that included 302 males and 448 females from the metropolitan Washington, DC, and Boston areas. Of this sample, 139 reporting IPV victimization only, 39 reported IPV perpetration only, 245 reported both IPV victimization and perpetration, and 334 reported neither IPV victimization nor perpetration. Respondents were recruited from community agencies involving identified IPV victims and perpetrators, agencies providing non-IPV services to demographically similar participants, community college settings, and general public community settings, e.g., fast food restaurants. The sample was a convenience, not a representative, sample. Selection criteria included the following: (1) involvement in an intimate partner relationship within the past 12 months, and (2) being 18 years of age or older. Respondents were excluded if they exhibited signs of intoxication or other indications of a lack of coherence sufficient to complete the survey. Both data files contain demographic information. Respondents were asked several series of questions including those pertaining to demands received from their partner, whether their partner did anything to find out if the respondent had done what the partner had demanded, if their partner made them feel the partner might do something if the respondent did not do what the partner wanted, and whether they had done certain things when their partner demanded something. Respondents were then asked the same series of questions conversely. Respondents were read a statement and asked how often they felt this way in the past month, asked whether in the last 12 months they had experienced certain physical abuse or abused their partner physically, and they were asked whether in the last 12 months they had experienced certain types of emotional abuse or had abused their partner emotionally. Respondents were read a series of statements regarding their relationships with people in general and asked to tell whether the statement was true or false, asked how often they had experienced problems in response to a trauma, and asked how likely their partner might attempt to abuse the respondent in specific ways in the next year.",

Information from those interviews is contained in Part 1,\r\n Phase One, Interview Data. In Phase Two, 17 women from the prison\r\n and/or the community who had participated in the Phase One interviews\r\n were again interviewed in an effort to provide more depth about their\r\n experiences of victimization and of the resources, social services,\r\n and supports they may have received or not, subsequent to the\r\n victimization(s). Information from these qualitative follow-up\r\n interviews is contained in Parts 2-18.

Information on the quality of police-citizen encounters was drawn from surveys of citizens who had contact with the police in each of two cities, Schenectady and Syracuse, New York. Following the accumulation of survey data to form a baseline, survey results on citizens' satisfaction and judgments about procedural justice in their police contacts were summarized and reported to command staffs on a monthly basis\r\nthrough the departments' respective Compstat meetings. In this way the project\r\nprovided for measures of police performance with respect to procedural justice with sufficient periodicity that the information was potentially useful in managing performance.\r\nThe study addressed four specific questions:\r\nDoes performance on these outcomes - procedural justice and citizen satisfaction - improve when information on these outcomes is incorporated into departments' systems of performance measurement and accountability?What do police managers do with this information, and how (if at all) are field supervisors and patrol officers affected by it?Are survey-based measures of citizens' subjective experiences valid measures of police performance, that is, do they reflect the procedural justice with which police act?Can survey based measures be deployed economically (e.g., through targeted sampling), and can other, less expensive measures of the quality of police-citizen encounters be substituted for survey-based measures?\r\nTo answer these questions, researches used a mixed methods data collection plan. In both Schenectady and Syracuse, a survey was administered to people who had recent contact with the police. Semi-monthly samples were randomly drawn from police records of calls for service, stops, and arrests from mid-July, 2011, through mid-January, 2013. Across the 18 months of surveying, 3,603 interviews were completed. Also carried out, was a survey of key informants in each city - neighborhood association leaders - in order to extend the assessment of public perceptions of the local police beyond those who have direct contact with police to the larger community. Interviews with patrol officers and supervisors were also conducted in both sites, once at about the mid-point of the 18-month police services survey and again at the conclusion of the surveying. Interviews were conducted with the commanders shortly after the project was introduced to them in October of 2011.

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThe main aim of this research is to study the criminal mobility of ethnic-based organized crime groups. The project examines whether organized crime groups are able to move abroad easily and to reproduce their territorial control in a foreign country, or whether these groups, and/or individual members, start a life of crime only after their arrival in the new territories, potentially as a result of social exclusion, economic strain, culture conflict and labeling. More specifically, the aim is to examine the criminal mobility of ethnic Albanian organized crime groups involved in a range of criminal markets and operating in and around New York City, area and to study the relevance of the importation/alien conspiracy model versus the deprivation model of organized crime in relation to Albanian organized crime. There are several analytical dimensions in this study: (1) reasons for going abroad; (2) the nature of the presence abroad; (3) level of support from ethnic constituencies in the new territories; (4) importance of cultural codes; (5) organizational structure; (6) selection of criminal activities; (7) economic incentives and political infiltration. This study utilizes a mixed-methods approach with a sequential exploratory design, in which qualitative data and documents are collected and analyzed first, followed by quantitative data. Demographic variables in this collection include age, gender, birth place, immigration status, nationality, ethnicity, education, religion, and employment status.\r\nTwo main data sources were employed: (1) court documents, including indictments and court transcripts related to select organized crime cases (84 court documents on 29 groups, 254 offenders); (2) in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 9 ethnic Albanian offenders currently serving prison sentences in U.S. Federal Prisons for organized crime related activities, and with 79 adult ethnic Albanian immigrants in New York, including common people, undocumented migrants, offenders, and people with good knowledge of Albanian organized crime modus operandi. Sampling for these data were conducted in five phases, the first of which involved researchers examining court documents and identifying members of 29 major ethnic Albanian organized crime groups operating in the New York area between 1975 and 2013 who were or had served sentences in the U.S. Federal Prisons for organized crime related activities.  In phase two researchers conducted eight in-depth interviews with law enforcement experts working in New York or New Jersey. Phase three involved interviews with members of the Albanian diaspora and filed observations from an ethnographic study. Researchers utilized snowball and respondent driven (RDS) recruitment methods to create the sample for the diaspora dataset. The self-reported criteria for recruitment to participate in the diaspora interviews were: (1) age 18 or over; (2) of ethnic Albanian origin (foreign-born or 1st/2nd generation); and (3) living in NYC area for at least 1 year. They also visited neighborhoods identified as high concentrations of ethnic Albanian individuals and conducted an ethnographic study to locate the target population. In phase four, data for the cultural advisors able to help with the project data was collected. In the fifth and final phase, researchers gathered data for the second wave of the diaspora data, and conducted interviews with offenders with ethnic Albanian immigrants with knowledge of the organized crime situation in New York City area. Researchers also approached about twenty organized crime figures currently serving a prison sentence, and were able to conduct 9 in-depth interviews. ",

At Time 1 of the study interview cut-points were established for high and low risk on nine risk factors that were included on the assessment. Those who scored high risk on four or more risk factors were determined eligible for secondary prevention. At time 2 each participate was then classified into one of four levels of gang membership. The goal of this was to investigate how successful the GREF was in identifying the youth (in the absence of a program) who become associated with a street gang in the 12 to 18 months of the study time frame .",

At Time 1 of the study interview cut-points were established for high and low risk on nine risk factors that were included on the assessment. Those who scored high risk on four or more risk factors were determined eligible for secondary prevention. At time 2 each participate was then classified into one of four levels of gang membership. The goal of this was to investigate how successful the GREF was in identifying the youth (in the absence of a program) who become associated with a street gang in the 12 to 18 months of the study time frame .",

The viewsheds of over 100 CCTV cameras within the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were defined and grouped into 13 clusters, and camera locations were digitally mapped. Crime data from 2003-2013 was collected from areas that were visible to the selected cameras, as well as data from control and displacement areas using an incident reporting database that records the location of crime events. Demographic information was also collected from the mapped areas, such as population density, household information, and data on the specific camera(s) in the area. This study also investigated the perception of CCTV cameras, and interviewed members of the public regarding topics such as what they thought the camera could see, who was watching the camera feed, and if they were concerned about being filmed.",

The viewsheds of over 100 CCTV cameras within the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania were defined and grouped into 13 clusters, and camera locations were digitally mapped. Crime data from 2003-2013 was collected from areas that were visible to the selected cameras, as well as data from control and displacement areas using an incident reporting database that records the location of crime events. Demographic information was also collected from the mapped areas, such as population density, household information, and data on the specific camera(s) in the area. This study also investigated the perception of CCTV cameras, and interviewed members of the public regarding topics such as what they thought the camera could see, who was watching the camera feed, and if they were concerned about being filmed.",

This research examined the prevalence of child exposure to psychological and physical Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and parent-to-child aggression (PCA), proximal associations with child externalizing and internalizing behavior, social and scholastic competence in early childhood and adolescence, and the developmental timing and intergenerational transmission of exposure to IPV and PCA related to child externalizing behavior. The study also looked at child effortful control and positive parenting as risk and protective factors theorized to mediate associations between child exposure to family violence and later child adjustment. Secondary analyses were conducted using a prospective multigenerational data set involving community families from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds that comprise the Three Generational Study.\r\n The study collection includes 3 SPSS (.sav) files.

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThe research purpose of this project was to advance the scientific understanding of children's exposure to family violence and children's adjustment. This research examined the prevalence of child exposure to psychological and physical Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and parent-to-child aggression (PCA), proximal associations with child externalizing and internalizing behavior, social and scholastic competence in early childhood and adolescence, and the developmental timing and intergenerational transmission of exposure to IPV and PCA related to child externalizing behavior. The study also looked at child effortful control and positive parenting as risk and protective factors theorized to mediate associations between child exposure to family violence and later child adjustment. Secondary analyses were conducted using a prospective multigenerational data set involving community families from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds that comprise the Three Generational Study.\r\n The study collection includes 3 SPSS (.sav) files.

VMF is a veteran-only housing unit for male inmates who have served in the U.S. military. When the grant was written, experts in the field had noted that the population of veterans returning to the U.S. with numerous mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and depression, were increasing and as a result, the number of veterans incarcerated in jails and prisons was also expected to increase. While numerous specialized courts for veterans had been implemented across the country at the time, veteran-specific housing units for those already sentenced to serve time in custody were rarer and no evaluations of these units had been published. Since this evaluation grant was awarded, the number of veteran-only housing units has increased, demonstrating the need for more evaluation information regarding lessons learned.\r\nA core goal when creating VMF was to structure an environment for veterans to draw upon the positive aspects of their shared military culture, create a safe place for healing and rehabilitation, and foster positive peer connections. There are several components that separate VMF from traditional housing with the general population that relate to the overall environment, the rehabilitative focus, and initiation of reentry planning as early as possible. These components include the selection of correctional staff with military backgrounds and an emphasis on building on their shared experience and connecting through it; a less restrictive and more welcoming environment that includes murals on the walls and open doors; no segregation of inmates by race/ethnicity; incentives including extended dayroom time and use of a microwave and coffee machine (under supervision); mandatory rehabilitative programming that focuses on criminogenic and other underlying risks and needs or that are quality of life focused, such as yoga, meditation, and art; a VMF Counselor who is located in the unit to provide one-on-one services to clients, as well as provide overall program management on a day-to-day basis; the regular availability of VA staff in the unit, including linkages to staff knowledgeable about benefits and other resources available upon reentry; and the guidance and assistance of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to support reentry transition for individuals needing additional assistance.\r\nThe general criteria for housing in this veteran module includes: (1) not being at a classification level above a four, which requires a maximum level of custody; (2) not having less than 30 days to serve in custody; (3) no state or federal prison holds and/or prison commitments; (4) no fugitive holds; (5) no prior admittance to the psychiatric security unit or a current psychiatric hold; (6) not currently a Post-Release Community Supervision Offender serving a term of flash incarceration; (7) not in custody for a sex-related crime or requirement to register per Penal Code 290; (8) no specialized housing requirements including protective custody, administration segregation, or medical segregation; and (9) no known significant disciplinary incidents.",

In particular, the study assessed the form YLS/CMI policies take in local Pennsylvania counties\r\nand their consistency with the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model, the extent to which officers' routine practices align with policies and RNR principles, and how state and county factors have shaped local policies\r\nand practices. In doing so, it sought to highlight promising strategies for\r\neffective RNA implementation. Study findings describe an example of an apparently well-planned statewide effort to implement and support the YLS/CMI in local counties, involving a sustained attention to attention to training, quality assurance, and problem-solving. Local county policies, while showing some variation, focused on strategies for conducting the YLS/CMI assessment and applying its results\r\nto a variety of decisions and activities--supporting, in particular, risk and need principles. Study results further suggest a substantial statewide level of practitioner adherence to a general policy model, though this pattern was stronger for some activities than others, and varied substantially by local county. Variation in implementation across counties seemed to relate, in particular, to the extent of local quality assurance processes, leadership enthusiasm for the YLS/CMI, staff enthusiasm for evidence-based practices (with implications for training and recruitment), and organizational climate.",

The project team also conducted a literature review that consists of two major sections: one focused on how costs of victimization are estimated and the other on estimation methods and data sources concerning the incidence, prevalence, and concentration of victimization.\r\nThe data collection activities and literature reviews, combined with extensive input from an advisory board of experts throughout the project, inform the menu of recommendations proposed in Volume III.

The researcher carried out this study by adding Federal Bureau\r\n of Investigation criminal history information to an existing database\r\n (Clear et al.) that studied the relationship between an inmate's\r\n religiousness and his adjustment to the correctional setting. Four\r\n types of information were used in this study. The first three types\r\n were obtained by the original research team and included an inmate\r\n values and religiousness instrument, a pre-release questionnaire, and\r\n a three-month post-release follow-up phone survey. The fourth type of\r\n information, official criminal history reports, was later added to the\r\n original dataset by the principal investigator for this study. The\r\n prisoner values survey collected information on what the respondent\r\n would do if a friend sold drugs from the cell or if inmates of his\r\n race attacked others. Respondents were also asked if they thought God\r\n was revealed in the scriptures, if they shared their faith with\r\n others, and if they took active part in religious\r\n services. Information collected from the pre-release questionnaire\r\n included whether the respondent attended group therapy, religious\r\n groups with whom he would live, types of treatment programs he would\r\n participate in after prison, employment plans, how often he would go\r\n to church, whether he would be angry more in prison or in the free\r\n world, and whether he would be more afraid of being attacked in prison\r\n or in the free world. Each inmate also described his criminal history\r\n and indicated whether he thought he was able to do things as well as\r\n most others, whether he was satisfied with himself on the whole or\r\n felt that he was a failure, whether religion was talked about in the\r\n home, how often he attended religious services, whether he had friends\r\n who were religious while growing up, whether he had friends who were\r\n religious while in prison, and how often he participated in religious\r\n inmate counseling, religious services, in-prison religious seminars,\r\n and community service projects. The three-month post-release follow-up\r\n phone survey collected information on whether the respondent was\r\n involved with a church group, if the respondent was working for pay,\r\n if the respondent and his household received public assistance, if he\r\n attended religious services since his release, with whom the\r\n respondent was living, and types of treatment programs\r\n attended. Official post-release criminal records include information\r\n on the offenses the respondent was arrested and incarcerated for,\r\n prior arrests and incarcerations, rearrests, outcomes of offenses of\r\n rearrests, follow-up period to first rearrest, prison adjustment\r\n indicator, self-esteem indicator, time served, and measurements of the\r\n respondent's level of religious belief and personal\r\n identity. Demographic variables include respondent's faith, race,\r\n marital status, education, age at first arrest and incarceration, and\r\nage at incarceration for rearrest.",

-            "description": "The specific aim of this project was to evaluate the\r\nusefulness of the Seattle Police Department's (SPD) Lethality Scale in\r\nidentifying misdemeanor cases that might be high risk for escalating\r\nviolence and subsequent felony incidents. Data provide information on\r\n11,972 unique couples with incidents occurring between January 1,\r\n1995, and December 31, 1997, involving intimate couples in which the\r\nsuspect was at least 18 years old and the victim was at least 16,\r\nwith no age restriction for cases referred to the juvenile\r\ndivision. The researchers reformatted the Domestic Violence Unit's\r\n(DVU) database to reflect a three-year history of violence between\r\nunique couple members. Only intimate couples were considered, meaning\r\nsuspects and victims who were married, divorced, had a child in\r\ncommon, or were dating. The Lethality Scale was derived from the data\r\nin the DVU database. It was composed of six incident characteristic\r\ncomponents (offense score, weapon score, location score, injury score,\r\npersonal score, and incident/other score) with varying values that\r\ncontributed to an overall score. The Total Lethality Score was the sum\r\nof the values from these six components. The lethality score referred\r\nto an individual only and did not reflect information about other\r\npeople involved in the incident. To interpret the score, the DVU\r\nspecified a period of time--for example, six months--and computed\r\nlethality score values for every person involved in an incident during\r\nthis period. Information on individuals with a Total Lethality Score\r\nover a certain cut-off was printed and reviewed by a detective. Data\r\nare provided for up to 25 incidents per unique couple. Incident\r\nvariables in the dataset provide information on number of persons\r\ninvolved in the incident, time and weekday of the incident, beat,\r\nprecinct, census tract, and place where the incident occurred, type of\r\nprimary and secondary offenses, if a warrant was served, charges\r\nbrought, final disposition, weapon type used, arrests made, court\r\norder information, if evidence was collected, if statements or photos\r\nwere taken by the DVU, and sergeant action.

Data provide information on\r\n11,972 unique couples with incidents occurring between January 1,\r\n1995, and December 31, 1997, involving intimate couples in which the\r\nsuspect was at least 18 years old and the victim was at least 16,\r\nwith no age restriction for cases referred to the juvenile\r\ndivision. The researchers reformatted the Domestic Violence Unit's\r\n(DVU) database to reflect a three-year history of violence between\r\nunique couple members. Only intimate couples were considered, meaning\r\nsuspects and victims who were married, divorced, had a child in\r\ncommon, or were dating. The Lethality Scale was derived from the data\r\nin the DVU database. It was composed of six incident characteristic\r\ncomponents (offense score, weapon score, location score, injury score,\r\npersonal score, and incident/other score) with varying values that\r\ncontributed to an overall score. The Total Lethality Score was the sum\r\nof the values from these six components. The lethality score referred\r\nto an individual only and did not reflect information about other\r\npeople involved in the incident. To interpret the score, the DVU\r\nspecified a period of time--for example, six months--and computed\r\nlethality score values for every person involved in an incident during\r\nthis period. Information on individuals with a Total Lethality Score\r\nover a certain cut-off was printed and reviewed by a detective. Data\r\nare provided for up to 25 incidents per unique couple. Incident\r\nvariables in the dataset provide information on number of persons\r\ninvolved in the incident, time and weekday of the incident, beat,\r\nprecinct, census tract, and place where the incident occurred, type of\r\nprimary and secondary offenses, if a warrant was served, charges\r\nbrought, final disposition, weapon type used, arrests made, court\r\norder information, if evidence was collected, if statements or photos\r\nwere taken by the DVU, and sergeant action. Dates were converted to\r\ntime intervals and provide the number of days between the incident\r\ndate and the date the file was sent to the prosecutor, the date\r\ncharges were brought, and the date the case was officially\r\nclosed. Time intervals were also calculated for days between each\r\nincident for that couple. Personal information on the two persons in a\r\ncouple includes age, gender, injuries and treatment, relationship and\r\ncohabitation status of the individuals, pregnancy status of each\r\nindividual, alcohol and drug use at the time of the incident, and role\r\nof the individual in the incident (victim, suspect,\r\nvictim/suspect). Lethality scale scores are included as well as the\r\nnumber of incidents in which the unique couple was involved in 1995\r\nand 1996, and 1989 median household income for the census tract.",

-            "description": "This study addressed the question of whether women who were\r\n sexually abused as children were at increased risk of either sexual\r\n abuse or domestic violence victimization later in life. It also\r\n investigated the role of other potential risk factors, including\r\n family background, sexual behavior, alcohol problems, and a woman's\r\n own aggressive behavior. The investigators sought to answer the\r\n following questions: (1) Are victims of child sexual abuse at\r\n increased risk of adolescent or adult sexual victimization as compared\r\n to nonvictims? (2) Are victims of child sexual abuse at increased risk\r\n of physically violent nonsexual victimization as compared to\r\n nonvictims? (3) How is the risk of sexual revictimization and physical\r\n victimization among abuse survivors affected by their engaging in\r\n violent behavior, such as physical fighting, engaging in heavy\r\n drinking, and practicing risky sexual behavior, such as having\r\n multiple sexual partners? (4) Were women who reported drinking\r\n problems and physical fighting in Wave 2 at increased risk of domestic\r\n violence victimization at Wave 3, compared to the other child abuse\r\n victims in the study? This study consisted of a secondary analysis of\r\n selected variables collected during two waves of a three-wave\r\n prospective study of the consequences of child abuse and sexual\r\n assault for adult, adolescent, and child victims (McCahill, Meyer, and\r\n Fischman, 1979). During the first wave of the study, data were\r\n gathered on 206 girls ranging in age from 10 months to 12 years who\r\n were victims of reported cases of sexual abuse and who were examined\r\n at a municipal hospital in 1973-1975. In 1990 and 1991, follow-up\r\n interviews (Wave 2) were conducted with 136 of the original 206 girls,\r\n then aged 18 to 31. During this wave, a comparison group of girls\r\n treated at a hospital for reasons other than child sexual abuse was\r\n matched to the 206 victims on the basis of race, age, and date of\r\n hospital visit, for purposes of analysis of their official criminal\r\n records. The criminal records data are not included in this data\r\n collection. Also, none of the women in the comparison group were\r\n interviewed during Wave 2. In 1996 and 1997, another wave of follow-up\r\n interviews (Wave 3) was conducted. Using the same criteria as in Wave\r\n 2, a new matched comparison group was identified, resulting in an\r\n additional 85 girls in the sample. Of the 174 women interviewed during\r\n Wave 3, 80 were known victims of child sexual abuse who also had been\r\n interviewed during Wave 2. The data in Part 2 (Wave 3 Women Also\r\n Interviewed at Wave 2) are a subset of Part 1 (All Wave 3\r\n Interviews). Part 1 variables supply information on self-reported\r\n family history of substance abuse and criminal activity, parental care\r\n and neglect, and family violence when the respondent was a\r\n child. Topics focusing on respondents' current (adult) experiences\r\n include violence in relationships, injuries as a result of domestic\r\n violence, use of a weapon during domestic violence, sexual history,\r\n sexual victimization, and parental attachment. Variables in Part 2\r\n cover parental affection and support received by the respondent when\r\n she was a teenager, history of fighting, physical abuse by a partner,\r\n dating and sexual history, alcohol abuse, and sexual\r\n victimization. Demographic variables (found in Part 1 only) include\r\nage, marital status, race, and education.",

(3) How is the risk of sexual revictimization and physical\r\n victimization among abuse survivors affected by their engaging in\r\n violent behavior, such as physical fighting, engaging in heavy\r\n drinking, and practicing risky sexual behavior, such as having\r\n multiple sexual partners? (4) Were women who reported drinking\r\n problems and physical fighting in Wave 2 at increased risk of domestic\r\n violence victimization at Wave 3, compared to the other child abuse\r\n victims in the study? This study consisted of a secondary analysis of\r\n selected variables collected during two waves of a three-wave\r\n prospective study of the consequences of child abuse and sexual\r\n assault for adult, adolescent, and child victims (McCahill, Meyer, and\r\n Fischman, 1979). During the first wave of the study, data were\r\n gathered on 206 girls ranging in age from 10 months to 12 years who\r\n were victims of reported cases of sexual abuse and who were examined\r\n at a municipal hospital in 1973-1975. In 1990 and 1991, follow-up\r\n interviews (Wave 2) were conducted with 136 of the original 206 girls,\r\n then aged 18 to 31. During this wave, a comparison group of girls\r\n treated at a hospital for reasons other than child sexual abuse was\r\n matched to the 206 victims on the basis of race, age, and date of\r\n hospital visit, for purposes of analysis of their official criminal\r\n records. The criminal records data are not included in this data\r\n collection. Also, none of the women in the comparison group were\r\n interviewed during Wave 2. In 1996 and 1997, another wave of follow-up\r\n interviews (Wave 3) was conducted. Using the same criteria as in Wave\r\n 2, a new matched comparison group was identified, resulting in an\r\n additional 85 girls in the sample. Of the 174 women interviewed during\r\n Wave 3, 80 were known victims of child sexual abuse who also had been\r\n interviewed during Wave 2. The data in Part 2 (Wave 3 Women Also\r\n Interviewed at Wave 2) are a subset of Part 1 (All Wave 3\r\n Interviews). Part 1 variables supply information on self-reported\r\n family history of substance abuse and criminal activity, parental care\r\n and neglect, and family violence when the respondent was a\r\n child. Topics focusing on respondents' current (adult) experiences\r\n include violence in relationships, injuries as a result of domestic\r\n violence, use of a weapon during domestic violence, sexual history,\r\n sexual victimization, and parental attachment. Variables in Part 2\r\n cover parental affection and support received by the respondent when\r\n she was a teenager, history of fighting, physical abuse by a partner,\r\n dating and sexual history, alcohol abuse, and sexual\r\n victimization. Demographic variables (found in Part 1 only) include\r\nage, marital status, race, and education.",

Data for Part 1,\r\nStudent-Level Data, and Part 2, Incident-Level Data, were collected\r\nfrom a random sample of college students in the United States using a\r\nstructured telephone interview modeled after the redesigned National\r\nCrime Victimization Survey administered by the Bureau of Justice\r\nStatistics. Using stratified random sampling, over 3,000 college\r\nstudents from 12 schools were interviewed. Researchers collected\r\ndetailed information about the incident and the victimization, and\r\ndemographic characteristics of victims and nonvictims, as well as data\r\non self-protection, fear of crime, perceptions of crime on campus, and\r\ncampus security measures. For Part 3, School Data, the researchers\r\nsurveyed campus officials at the sampled schools and gathered official\r\ndata to supplement institution-level crime prevention information\r\nobtained from the students. Mail-back surveys were sent to directors\r\nof campus security or campus police at the 12 sampled schools,\r\naddressing various aspects of campus security, crime prevention\r\nprograms, and crime prevention services available on the\r\ncampuses. Additionally, mail-back surveys were sent to directors of\r\ncampus planning, facilities management, or related offices at the same\r\n12 schools to obtain information on the extent and type of planning\r\nand design actions taken by the campus for crime prevention. Part 3\r\nalso contains data on the characteristics of the 12 schools obtained\r\nfrom PETERSON'S GUIDE TO FOUR-YEAR COLLEGES (1994). Part 4, Census\r\nData, is comprised of 1990 Census data describing the census tracts in\r\nwhich the 12 schools were located and all tracts adjacent to the\r\nschools. Demographic variables in Part 1 include year of birth, sex,\r\nrace, marital status, current enrollment status, employment status,\r\nresidency status, and parents' education. Victimization variables\r\ninclude whether the student had ever been a victim of theft, burglary,\r\nrobbery, motor vehicle theft, assault, sexual assault, vandalism, or\r\nharassment. Students who had been victimized were also asked the\r\nnumber of times victimization incidents occurred, how often the police\r\nwere called, and if they knew the perpetrator. All students were asked\r\nabout measures of self-protection, fear of crime, perceptions of crime\r\non campus, and campus security measures. For Part 2, questions were\r\nasked about the location of each incident, whether the offender had a\r\nweapon, a description of the offense and the victim's response,\r\ninjuries incurred, characteristics of the offender, and whether the\r\nincident was reported to the police. For Part 3, respondents were\r\nasked about how general campus security needs were met, the nature and\r\nextent of crime prevention programs and services available at the\r\nschool (including when the program or service was first implemented),\r\nand recent crime prevention activities. Campus planners were asked if\r\nspecific types of campus security features (e.g., emergency telephone,\r\nterritorial markers, perimeter barriers, key-card access, surveillance\r\ncameras, crime safety audits, design review for safety features,\r\ntrimming shrubs and underbrush to reduce hiding places, etc.) were\r\npresent during the 1993-1994 academic year and if yes, how many or how\r\noften.

This study was funded to examine the workings\r\n of this court and its impact on the lives of victims. The four main\r\n goals of the research were: (1) to describe the workings of the\r\n primary components of this model jurisdiction in its response to\r\n domestic violence, specifically (a) what the police actually did when\r\n called to a domestic violence incident, (b) decisions made by the\r\n prosecutor's office and the court in their handling of these\r\n incidents, (c) how many victims talked to a victim advocate, and (d)\r\n how many offenders received batterer treatment and/or were\r\n incarcerated, (2) to describe the types of incidents, victims, and\r\n offenders seen in a full enforcement jurisdiction to determine if the\r\n types of cases coming to attention in such a setting looked similar to\r\n cases reported in studies from other jurisdictions, (3) to interview\r\n victims to hear directly about their experiences with a model court,\r\n and (4) to examine how well this model jurisdiction worked in\r\n preventing revictimization. Data used in this study were based on\r\n domestic violence cases that resulted in an arrest and arraignment\r\n before the Quincy District Court (QDC) during a seven-month study\r\n period. Six types of data were collected for this study: (1) The\r\n offender's criminal history prior to the study and for one year\r\n subsequent to the study incident were provided by the QDC's Department\r\n of Probation from the Massachusetts Criminal Records System Board. (2)\r\n Civil restraining order data were provided by the Department of\r\n Probation from a statewide registry of civil restraining orders. (3)\r\n Data on prosecutorial charges for up to three domestic\r\n violence-related charges were provided by the Department of\r\n Probation. (4) Data on defendants who attended batterer treatment\r\n programs were provided by directors of two such programs that served\r\n the QDC. (5) Police incident reports from the seven departments served\r\n by the QDC were used to measure the officer's perspective and actions\r\n taken relating to each incident, what the call for service involved,\r\n characteristics of the incident, socio-demographics of the\r\n participants, their narrative descriptions of the incident, and their\r\n stated response. (6) Interviews with victims were conducted one year\r\n after the occurrence of the study incident. Variables from\r\n administrative records include date and location of incident, number\r\n of suspects, age and race of victims and offenders, use of weapons,\r\n injuries, witnesses, whether there was an existing restraining order\r\n and its characteristics, charges filed by police, number and gender of\r\n police officers responding to the incident, victim's state at the time\r\n of the incident, offender's criminal history, and whether the offender\r\n participated in batterer treatment. The victim survey collected data\r\n on the victim's education and employment status, current living\r\n arrangement, relationship with offender, how the victim responded to\r\n the incident, how afraid the victim was, victim's opinions of police\r\n and the prosecutor, victim's sense of control, satisfaction with the\r\n court, victim's past violent relationships and child sexual abuse,\r\n victim's opinions on what the criminal justice system could do to stop\r\nabuse, and whether the victim obtained a restraining order.",

The DCJTC is a residential substance abuse\r\ntreatment center for drug-involved felony offenders. It provides a\r\ntreatment program of approximately six months in three major phases:\r\norientation, main treatment, and re-entry. Data were collected from\r\n429 offenders admitted to the DCJTC between January and December\r\n1998. During their first week of treatment, residents completed a\r\ncomprehensive intake battery that included (1) the Texas Christian\r\nUniversity (TCU) initial assessment, (2) the TCU self-rating form\r\n(SRF), and (3) the TCU intake interview. The initial assessment gauged\r\nmental status, background and psychosocial functioning, alcohol and\r\nother drug use, and psychological status. The SRF assessed\r\npsychological functioning, social functioning, and motivation for\r\ntreatment. The intake interview included detailed questions on the\r\nresident's social background, family and peer relations, health and\r\npsychological status, criminal history, drug use problems, and\r\nbehavioral risks for HIV/AIDS. Progress made during treatment was\r\nmeasured by the TCU Resident Evaluation of Self and Treatment (REST)\r\nand the TCU Counselor Rating of Client (CRC) forms. The REST included\r\nall questions on the SRF, plus questions on offenders' perceptions of\r\nthe structure of the program and their experiences while in treatment,\r\nan evaluation of the counselor, an evaluation of their own\r\npersonality, and ratings of group and individual treatment sessions.\r\nThe CRC forms rated residents on a set of attributes related to\r\nresidents' ability to benefit from treatment and indicated the extent\r\nto which counseling activities with each client had focused on certain\r\nactivities.",

The DCJTC is a residential substance abuse\r\ntreatment center for drug-involved felony offenders. It provides a\r\ntreatment program of approximately six months in three major phases:\r\norientation, main treatment, and re-entry. Data were collected from\r\n429 offenders admitted to the DCJTC between January and December\r\n1998. During their first week of treatment, residents completed a\r\ncomprehensive intake battery that included (1) the Texas Christian\r\nUniversity (TCU) initial assessment, (2) the TCU self-rating form\r\n(SRF), and (3) the TCU intake interview. The initial assessment gauged\r\nmental status, background and psychosocial functioning, alcohol and\r\nother drug use, and psychological status. The SRF assessed\r\npsychological functioning, social functioning, and motivation for\r\ntreatment. The intake interview included detailed questions on the\r\nresident's social background, family and peer relations, health and\r\npsychological status, criminal history, drug use problems, and\r\nbehavioral risks for HIV/AIDS. Progress made during treatment was\r\nmeasured by the TCU Resident Evaluation of Self and Treatment (REST)\r\nand the TCU Counselor Rating of Client (CRC) forms. The REST included\r\nall questions on the SRF, plus questions on offenders' perceptions of\r\nthe structure of the program and their experiences while in treatment,\r\nan evaluation of the counselor, an evaluation of their own\r\npersonality, and ratings of group and individual treatment sessions.\r\nThe CRC forms rated residents on a set of attributes related to\r\nresidents' ability to benefit from treatment and indicated the extent\r\nto which counseling activities with each client had focused on certain\r\nactivities.",

The project attempted to examine\r\nmore closely the relationships among inmate characteristics, treatment\r\nprocess, and treatment outcomes than previous studies in order to\r\nexplore critical issues in prison-based drug treatment programming and\r\npolicies. Researchers examined in-treatment measures and multiple\r\npost-release outcomes for inmates who participated in TC drug\r\ntreatment programs or comparison groups at five state prisons:\r\nGraterford, Houtzdale, Cresson, Waymart, and Huntingdon. Matched\r\ncomparison groups were made up of TC-eligible inmates who participated\r\nin less intensive forms of treatment (e.g., short-term drug education\r\nand outpatient treatment groups) due to a shortage of intensive\r\ntreatment slots at the five institutions. Included in the treatment\r\nsample were all current TC residents as of January 1, 2000. New\r\nsubjects were added to the study as they were admitted to treatment\r\nprograms. Between January 1 and November 30, 2000, data on all inmates\r\nadmitted to or discharged from alcohol or drug treatment programs were\r\ncollected on a monthly basis. Monthly tracking was continued\r\nthroughout the study to determine treatment outcomes (e.g., successful\r\nvs. unsuccessful). TC clients were asked to complete additional\r\nself-report measures that tapped psychological constructs and inmate\r\nperceptions of the treatment experience, and TC counselors were asked\r\nto complete periodic reassessments of each inmate's participation in\r\ntreatment. Self-reports of treatment process and psychological\r\nfunctioning were gathered within 30 days after admission, again after\r\nsix months, again at the end of 12 months, and again at discharge if\r\nthe inmate remained in TC longer than 12 months. Counselor ratings of\r\ninmate participation in treatment were similarly gathered one month,\r\nsix months, and 12 months following admission to treatment. After\r\nrelease, both treatment and comparison groups were tracked over time\r\nto monitor rearrest, reincarceration, drug use, and employment.\r\nMeasures can be broken down into the following four categories and\r\ntheir sources: (1) Inmate Background Factors were collected from the\r\nPennsylvania Additive Classification System (PACT), the Pennsylvania\r\nDepartment of Corrections Screening Instrument (PACSI), and the TCU\r\n(Texas Christian University) Drug Screen. (2) Institutional\r\nIndicators: Impacts Internal to the Prison Environment were collected\r\nfrom the Department of Corrections Misconduct Database, research and\r\nprogram records, and TCU Resident Evaluation of Self and Treatment\r\n(REST) forms. (3) Intermediate or \"Proximal\" Outcomes: Reductions in\r\nRisk for Drug Use and Criminal Behavior were collected from research\r\nand program records, TCU Counselor Rating of Client (CRC) forms, and\r\nTCU Resident Evaluation of Self and Treatment (REST) forms. (4)\r\nPost-Release Indicators: Inmate Behavior Upon Release from Prison were\r\ncollected from the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole,\r\nPennsylvania state police records provided by the Pennsylvania\r\nCommission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD), and the Department of\r\nCorrections inmate records system.",

The project attempted to examine\r\nmore closely the relationships among inmate characteristics, treatment\r\nprocess, and treatment outcomes than previous studies in order to\r\nexplore critical issues in prison-based drug treatment programming and\r\npolicies. Researchers examined in-treatment measures and multiple\r\npost-release outcomes for inmates who participated in TC drug\r\ntreatment programs or comparison groups at five state prisons:\r\nGraterford, Houtzdale, Cresson, Waymart, and Huntingdon. Matched\r\ncomparison groups were made up of TC-eligible inmates who participated\r\nin less intensive forms of treatment (e.g., short-term drug education\r\nand outpatient treatment groups) due to a shortage of intensive\r\ntreatment slots at the five institutions. Included in the treatment\r\nsample were all current TC residents as of January 1, 2000. New\r\nsubjects were added to the study as they were admitted to treatment\r\nprograms.

The process evaluation data consist of two administrations\r\nof the Correctional Institution Environment Scale (CIES) (Parts 1 and\r\n2) and three rounds of Rating of Facilitation of RSAT Groups (Parts\r\n3-5). Resident-participants in this study were male juvenile offenders\r\nincarcerated at the MCF-Red Wing who had been determined to have\r\nsignificant substance abuse problems as an aspect of their\r\ndelinquency. A total of 69 residents participated in the RSAT program\r\nduring the course of the evaluation. All RSAT program residents were\r\nrequired to participate in all aspects of the program. Four\r\ncaseworkers, one chemical dependency counselor, and two teachers\r\nparticipated in all aspects of the process evaluation. Ten corrections\r\nofficers and three administrators participated in the CIES\r\nadministration. There are four forms of the Correctional Institution\r\nEnvironment Scale (CIES): (1) The Real Form (Form R), (2) the Short\r\nForm (Form S), (3) the Ideal Form (Form I), and (4) the Expectations\r\nForm (Form E). Form R and Form I were employed in this study. Form R\r\nmeasures resident and staff perceptions of the current or \"actual\"\r\nclimate of the program. Form I is worded to allow residents and staff\r\nto answer questions in terms of an ideal program. Both forms are\r\ncomprised of 90 true-false statements. The CIES was administered twice\r\nfor this study, with the first administration in September\r\n1999. Participants in this administration of the CIES were 28\r\nresidents of the Princeton Cottage (the cottage that housed the RSAT\r\nparticipants) and 12 staff (administrators, caseworkers, and\r\ncorrections officers). The second administration was in December\r\n1999. Participants in this administration were 25 residents of the\r\nPrinceton Cottage and 10 staff (administrators, caseworkers, and\r\ncorrections officers). The surveys were collected and sent to\r\nMarquette University investigators for scoring and interpretation. An\r\nextensive evaluation of group facilitation was undertaken, with all\r\ngroups videotaped between May 1999 and September 1999. These\r\nvideotapes were shipped to Marquette University for review. In total,\r\n122 videotapes were reviewed and rated. Two randomly selected raters\r\nevaluated each tape on the 22-item Red Wing Global Scale developed for\r\nthis evaluation. The primary components of the sessions evaluated by\r\nthe rating scale involved (1) the adherence of the facilitators to the\r\ntreatment model, (2) the skill level of the facilitators, and (3) the\r\ncontribution of the residents to the group processes. Following\r\ntraining, the raters began rating the videotapes in a progression of\r\nthree rounds (each round consisting of a month) conducted in June,\r\nAugust, and October of 1999.",

More recently,\r\n policies advocating accountability seem to have predominated over\r\n other goals of the court, and concern exists that structured\r\n decision-making (SDM) in support of individual accountability has\r\n begun to fundamentally change the juvenile justice system. This study\r\n examined the use of SDM in state correctional agencies in Illinois,\r\n Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio and in juvenile courts in three counties\r\n in each of those states. Data were collected in phases from March 1999\r\n to August 2000 during periodic site visits. Probation officers, judges\r\n and referees, prosecutors, and defense attorneys were interviewed in\r\n each of the 12 courts. Each survey contained a core set of questions\r\n eliciting respondents' views of juvenile justice, disposition\r\n objectives, and the use and value of SDM. Questions relevant to\r\n particular decision-makers were also included. All respondents\r\n provided demographic information and information about their job\r\nexperience in criminal justice and professional training.",

More recently,\r\n policies advocating accountability seem to have predominated over\r\n other goals of the court, and concern exists that structured\r\n decision-making (SDM) in support of individual accountability has\r\n begun to fundamentally change the juvenile justice system. This study\r\n examined the use of SDM in state correctional agencies in Illinois,\r\n Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio and in juvenile courts in three counties\r\n in each of those states. Data were collected in phases from March 1999\r\n to August 2000 during periodic site visits. Probation officers, judges\r\n and referees, prosecutors, and defense attorneys were interviewed in\r\n each of the 12 courts. Each survey contained a core set of questions\r\n eliciting respondents' views of juvenile justice, disposition\r\n objectives, and the use and value of SDM. Questions relevant to\r\n particular decision-makers were also included. All respondents\r\n provided demographic information and information about their job\r\nexperience in criminal justice and professional training.",

Data were\r\ncollected in 2001 at four separate times (quarterly) during the year\r\nin 33 metropolitan areas in the United States. The ADAM program\r\nadopted a new instrument in 2000 in adult booking facilities for male\r\n(Part 1) and female (Part 2) arrestees. Data from arrestees in\r\njuvenile detention facilities (Part 3) continued to use the juvenile\r\ninstrument from previous years, extending back through the DRUG USE\r\nFORECASTING series (ICPSR 9477). The ADAM program in 2001 also\r\ncontinued the use of probability-based sampling for male arrestees in\r\nadult facilities, which was initiated in 2000. Therefore, the male\r\nadult sample includes weights, generated through post-sampling\r\nstratification of the data. For the adult files, variables fell into\r\none of eight categories: (1) demographic data on each arrestee, (2)\r\nADAM facesheet (records-based) data, (3) data on disposition of the\r\ncase, including accession to a verbal consent script, (4) calendar of\r\nadmissions to substance abuse and mental health treatment programs,\r\n(5) data on alcohol and drug use, abuse, and dependence (6) drug\r\nacquisition data covering the five most commonly used illicit drugs,\r\n(7) urine test results, and (8) weights. The juvenile file contains\r\ndemographic variables and arrestee's self-reported past and continued\r\nuse of 15 drugs, as well as other drug-related behaviors.",

Data were\r\ncollected in 2001 at four separate times (quarterly) during the year\r\nin 33 metropolitan areas in the United States. The ADAM program\r\nadopted a new instrument in 2000 in adult booking facilities for male\r\n(Part 1) and female (Part 2) arrestees. Data from arrestees in\r\njuvenile detention facilities (Part 3) continued to use the juvenile\r\ninstrument from previous years, extending back through the DRUG USE\r\nFORECASTING series (ICPSR 9477). The ADAM program in 2001 also\r\ncontinued the use of probability-based sampling for male arrestees in\r\nadult facilities, which was initiated in 2000. Therefore, the male\r\nadult sample includes weights, generated through post-sampling\r\nstratification of the data. For the adult files, variables fell into\r\none of eight categories: (1) demographic data on each arrestee, (2)\r\nADAM facesheet (records-based) data, (3) data on disposition of the\r\ncase, including accession to a verbal consent script, (4) calendar of\r\nadmissions to substance abuse and mental health treatment programs,\r\n(5) data on alcohol and drug use, abuse, and dependence (6) drug\r\nacquisition data covering the five most commonly used illicit drugs,\r\n(7) urine test results, and (8) weights. The juvenile file contains\r\ndemographic variables and arrestee's self-reported past and continued\r\nuse of 15 drugs, as well as other drug-related behaviors.",

The data collection evaluates the impact of ISP on \r\n recidivism rates, prison space availability, and cost effectiveness and \r\n also assesses the opinions of criminal justice professionals toward the \r\n program. In the first file data collected on four types of sentenced \r\n felons include education, psychological condition, financial status, \r\n substance abuse, prior and follow-up criminal records, earning and \r\n payment records, sentence and correctional histories, and case \r\n characteristics including sentences, offenses, and other dispositions. \r\n The second file presents data on type of criminal justice professional \r\n interviewed, opinion scale scores on aspects of ISP, and suggestions \r\nfor ISP.",

The purpose of this research study was three-fold: (1) to create an empirically-based profile of issues and approaches, (2) to develop a practical road map for policy and practice, and (3) to advance the knowledge, policy, and practice of academic institutions, law enforcement, government, and researchers. The study design incorporated three methods of data collection: a quantitative field survey, qualitative one-on-one interviews, and an empirical assessment of the institutions' network activity. Survey data collection involved simple random sampling of 600 academic institutions from the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) database, recruitment via postcard, telephone, and email, Web-based survey administration, and three follow-ups. Results are contained in Part 1, Quantitative Field Survey Data. Interview data collection involved selecting a sample size of 15 institutions through a combination of simple random and convenience sampling, recruitment via telephone and email, and face-to-face or telephone interviews. Results are contained in Part 2, Qualitative One-on-One Interview Data. Network analysis data collection involved convenience sampling of two academic institutions, recruitment via telephone and email, installing Higher Education Network Analysis (HENA) on participants' systems, and six months of data collection. Results are in Part 3, Subject 1 Network Analysis Data, and Part 4, Subject 2 Network Analysis Data. The Quantitative Field Survey Data (Part 1) contains 19 variables on characteristics of institutions that participated in the survey component of this study, as well as 263 variables derived from responses to the Information Security in Academic Institutions Survey, which was organized into five sections: Environment, Policy, Information Security Controls, Information Security Challenges, and Resources. The Qualitative One-on-One Interview Data (Part 2) contains qualitative responses to a combination of closed-response and open-response formats. The data are divided into the following seven sections: Environment, Institution's Potential Vulnerability, Institution's Potential Threat, Information Value and Sharing, End Users, Countermeasures, and Insights.

-            "description": "The purpose of the Habeas Corpus Litigation in United States District Courts: An Empirical Study, 2007 is to provide empirical information about habeas corpus cases filed by state prisoners in United States District Courts under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The writ of habeas corpus is a remedy regulated by statute and available in federal court to persons \"in custody in violation of the Constitution...\" When a federal court grants a writ of habeas corpus, it orders the state court to release the prisoner, or to repeat the trial, sentencing, or other proceeding that led to the prisoner's custody. Each year, state prisoners file between 16,000 and 18,000 cases seeking habeas corpus relief. The study was the first to collect empirical information about this litigation, a decade after AEDPA was passed. It sought to shed light upon an otherwise unexplored area of habeas corpus law by looking at samples of capital and non-capital cases and describing the court processing and general demographic information of these cases in detail.\r\nAEDPA changed habeas law by:\r\n\r\nEstablishing a 1-year statute of limitation for filing a federal habeas petition, which begins when appeal of the state judgment is complete, and is tolled during \"properly filed\" state post-conviction proceedings;\r\nAuthorizing federal judges to deny on the merits any claim that a petitioner failed to exhaust in state court;\r\nProhibiting a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner failed to develop the facts in state court, except in limited circumstances;\r\nBarring successive petitions, except in limited circumstances; and\r\nMandating a new standard of review for evaluating state court determinations of fact and applications of constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe information found within this study is for policymakers who design or assess changes in habeas law, for litigants and courts who address the scope and meaning of the habeas statutes, and for researchers who seek information concerning the processing of habeas petitions in federal courts. Descriptive findings are provided detailing petitioner demographics, state proceedings, representation of petitioner in federal court, petitions, type of proceeding challenged, claims raised, intermediate orders, litigation steps, processing time, non-merits dispositions and merits disposition for both capital and non-capital cases which lead into the comparative and explanatory findings that provide information on current and past habeas litigation and how it has been effected by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.",

The writ of habeas corpus is a remedy regulated by statute and available in federal court to persons \"in custody in violation of the Constitution...\" When a federal court grants a writ of habeas corpus, it orders the state court to release the prisoner, or to repeat the trial, sentencing, or other proceeding that led to the prisoner's custody. Each year, state prisoners file between 16,000 and 18,000 cases seeking habeas corpus relief. The study was the first to collect empirical information about this litigation, a decade after AEDPA was passed. It sought to shed light upon an otherwise unexplored area of habeas corpus law by looking at samples of capital and non-capital cases and describing the court processing and general demographic information of these cases in detail.\r\nAEDPA changed habeas law by:\r\n\r\nEstablishing a 1-year statute of limitation for filing a federal habeas petition, which begins when appeal of the state judgment is complete, and is tolled during \"properly filed\" state post-conviction proceedings;\r\nAuthorizing federal judges to deny on the merits any claim that a petitioner failed to exhaust in state court;\r\nProhibiting a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner failed to develop the facts in state court, except in limited circumstances;\r\nBarring successive petitions, except in limited circumstances; and\r\nMandating a new standard of review for evaluating state court determinations of fact and applications of constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe information found within this study is for policymakers who design or assess changes in habeas law, for litigants and courts who address the scope and meaning of the habeas statutes, and for researchers who seek information concerning the processing of habeas petitions in federal courts. Descriptive findings are provided detailing petitioner demographics, state proceedings, representation of petitioner in federal court, petitions, type of proceeding challenged, claims raised, intermediate orders, litigation steps, processing time, non-merits dispositions and merits disposition for both capital and non-capital cases which lead into the comparative and explanatory findings that provide information on current and past habeas litigation and how it has been effected by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.",

To avoid the ambiguities that could arise in analyses across the two survey periods, the researchers analyzed the NCS (1973-1991) and NCVS data (1992-2000) separately. They focused on incidents that involved a female victim and one or more male offenders. The sample for 1973-1991 included 1,609 rapes and the corresponding sample for 1992-2000 contained 636 rapes. In their analyses, the researchers controlled for changes in forms of interviewing used in the NCS and NCVS. Logistic regression was used to estimate effects on the measures of police notification. The analyses incorporated the currently best available methods of accounting for design effects in the NCS and NCVS.  Police notification served as the dependent variable in the study and was measured in two ways. First, the analysis included a polytomous dependent variable that contrasted victim reported incidents and third-party reported incidents, respectively, with nonreported incidents. Second, a binary dependent variable, police notified, also was included.  The primary independent variables in the analysis were the year of occurrence of the incident reported by the victim and the relationship between the victim and the offender. The regression models estimated included several control variables, including measures of respondents' socioeconomic status, as well as other victim, offender, and incident characteristics that may be related both to the nature of rape and to the likelihood that victims notify the police.",

The BPYS program differed from other anti-bullying programs by providing teachers with a specific curriculum\r\nthat could be implemented in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to\r\nevaluate the BPYS program at the elementary school and middle school level.\r\nThe BPYS outcome evaluation consisted of school climate surveys administered to elementary school students (Part 1), middle school students (Part 2), and staff (Part 3) in both treatment and comparison schools. The design of the data collection for the study was a repeated cross-sectional design.  The evaluation of BPYS took place over five years.  In the spring semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, all participating schools completed a school climate survey. The researchers collected 4,136 completed elementary school surveys (Part 1), 1,627 completed middle school surveys (Part 2), and 1,209 completed staff surveys (Part 3). For the elementary and middle school students, the mode of data collection was an in-class (group administration) anonymous self-completed survey. For the 1,209 staff surveys (Part 3), the mode of data collection was a mail questionnaire. Part 1 variables include sociodemographic and general school information items, school climate variables, school safety variables, and home and family environment variables. Also included is a filter variable which can be used to select the 3,497 cases that were used in the original analyses. Part 2 variables include sociodemographic and general school information variables, school climate variables, school safety variables, substance use variables, home and family environment variables, variables about guns, variables on activities the respondent participated in, and school attendance variables. Part 3 variables include school and staff characteristics variables, questions about general conditions in the school, questions on how the respondent felt about other people working at the school, questions concerning the resources and participation in the school and the community, and questions regarding staff perceptions of safety at the school.",

The BPYS program differed from other anti-bullying programs by providing teachers with a specific curriculum\r\nthat could be implemented in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to\r\nevaluate the BPYS program at the elementary school and middle school level.\r\nThe BPYS outcome evaluation consisted of school climate surveys administered to elementary school students (Part 1), middle school students (Part 2), and staff (Part 3) in both treatment and comparison schools. The design of the data collection for the study was a repeated cross-sectional design.  The evaluation of BPYS took place over five years.  In the spring semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, all participating schools completed a school climate survey. The researchers collected 4,136 completed elementary school surveys (Part 1), 1,627 completed middle school surveys (Part 2), and 1,209 completed staff surveys (Part 3). For the elementary and middle school students, the mode of data collection was an in-class (group administration) anonymous self-completed survey. For the 1,209 staff surveys (Part 3), the mode of data collection was a mail questionnaire. Part 1 variables include sociodemographic and general school information items, school climate variables, school safety variables, and home and family environment variables. Also included is a filter variable which can be used to select the 3,497 cases that were used in the original analyses. Part 2 variables include sociodemographic and general school information variables, school climate variables, school safety variables, substance use variables, home and family environment variables, variables about guns, variables on activities the respondent participated in, and school attendance variables. Part 3 variables include school and staff characteristics variables, questions about general conditions in the school, questions on how the respondent felt about other people working at the school, questions concerning the resources and participation in the school and the community, and questions regarding staff perceptions of safety at the school.",

Thirteen experts who agreed to be interviewed were mailed a list of processes of resistance measure items and asked to give recommendations on how domestic violence counselors can respond to a client engaging in those behaviors in treatment. Interviews were conducted by telephone in November 2005, with an interviewer and note taker, and audiotaped. Part 1 (Study One Quantitative Data) and Part 2 (Study Two Quantitative Data) include demographic variables such as age, race, level of education, employment and income level, relationship to the domestic assault victim, months in batterer treatment, and criminal history. Both Parts also include variables to measure stage of change, decisional balance, processes of change, self-efficacy, physical and psychological aggression, social desirability, at risk drinking, and physical and mental health. Additionally, Part 2 includes variables on program attendance and completion. Part 3 (Study Three Expert Interviews Qualitative Data) includes domestic violence experts recommendations for managing eight types of resistance in batterer treatment including system blaming, problems with partner, problems with alliance, social justification, hopelessness, isolation, psychological reactance, and passive reactance.",

In Part 1, Batterer Program Experiment Data, convicted male\r\n domestic violence offenders from court parts AP10 (Pretrial\r\n Appearances) or TAP2 (Trials) of the Bronx Misdemeanor Domestic\r\n Violence Court were randomly assigned into one of four experimental\r\n conditions. The four conditions were batterer program plus monthly\r\n judicial monitoring (n = 102), batterer program plus graduated\r\n monitoring (n = 100), monthly monitoring only (n = 109), and graduated\r\n monitoring only (n = 109). Defendants assigned to a batterer program\r\n completed either the Domestic Violence Accountability Program (DVAP)\r\n run by Safe Horizon or the Men's Choices Program run by the Fordham\r\n Tremont Community Mental Health Center. The offenders were tracked for\r\n at least 12 months after sentencing, and for up to 18 months for most\r\n of the men, to determine whether they fulfilled the conditions of\r\n their sentence, were rearrested for domestic violence, or were\r\n reported by the victim to have engaged in new incidents of abuse.\r\n Using each offender's New York State criminal identification number,\r\n complete criminal record files, including prior criminal history and\r\n recidivism, were obtained from the New York State Division of Criminal\r\n Justice Services (DCJS). Victims were interviewed about new domestic\r\n incidents committed within one year of sentencing. In Part 2,\r\n Monitoring Experiment Data, a quasi-experimental study using\r\n propensity score matching compared recidivism outcomes between the\r\n randomized offenders in Part 1 and a control group of conditional\r\n discharge (CD) offenders convicted of identical offenses, but who, as\r\n a result of the normal sentencing process, received neither a batterer\r\n program nor any form of monitoring. The propensity score predicted the\r\n probability of inclusion in the randomized trial (Part 1) sample,\r\n based not on actual membership in that sample, but on the statistical\r\n probability of membership in it, as computed from the observed set of\r\n background characteristics. Each offender in the randomized trial was\r\n then matched to the offender in the CD only group with the nearest\r\n propensity score. Sometimes multiple offenders from the the initial\r\n trial were matched to the same CD only offender. Variables in both\r\n Part 1 and Part 2 of the data set include demographic variables for\r\n both the defendants and victims, defendant arrest history, current\r\n sentence, assignment to a batterer program, type of judicial\r\n monitoring, and victim reports of new incidents of violence after\r\nsentencing.",

-            "description": "The ultimate purpose of the study was to test whether court-mandated counseling reduced the likelihood of repeat violence by men convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. Researchers also tested the underlying theory arising from the reanalyses of the Minneapolis experiment (MINNEAPOLIS INTERVENTION PROJECT, 1986-1987 [ICPSR 9808]) and Spouse Assault Replication Programs (SARPs). This theory proposes that having a stake in conformity predicts when an intervention (whether an arrest or court-mandated treatment) will be effective in reducing the likelihood of subsequent violence.\r\nThe study used a classical experimental design to test whether courts can effect change in men convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence by mandating them to participate in a spouse abuse abatement program (SAAP). All men convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence in Broward County, Florida, between May 1 and September 30, 1997, were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group. The only exceptions were for those couples in which either defendant or victim did not speak English or Spanish; either defendant or victim was under 18 years of age; the defendant was severely mentally ill; or the judge, at the time of sentencing, allowed the defendant to move to another jurisdiction and serve his probation through mail contact. Of the remaining 404 defendants, men in the control group were sentenced to 1 year's probation and men in the experimental group were sentenced to 1 year's probation and mandated into one of the five local SAAPs.\r\nIn an effort to determine the true amount of change in individuals undergoing court-mandated counseling, the researchers included various measures from several sources. Each batterer was interviewed at time of adjudication and again six months after adjudication. The victim was also interviewed at adjudication and 6 and 12 months after adjudication. Standardized measures with known reliability were used when possible. Probation records and computer checks with the local police for all new arrests were used to track the defendants for one year after adjudication.\r\nThe defendant interviews asked questions to assess the defendant's stake in conformity including those dealing with his relationship to the victim, his employment, his residential stability and his relationship to others.\r\nIncluded in these interviews were questions from an abbreviated version of the Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale, the Shortened Attitudes Towards Women Scale, the Inventory of Beliefs About Wife Beating (IBWB), and the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale. The data file also includes questions dealing with offenders' perceptions of the fairness of the criminal justice process they had just been through, who they believed was responsible for the instant offense that brought them to court, and whether they felt coerced into the batterer's program.\r\nThe victim interviews were similar to the defendants though most of the questions asked the victim to provide information about the offender and his relationship with her. The woman was also asked to provide information on her work history, who she regularly spent time with, whether she had spoken with family, friends, and neighbors about her relationship with the offender and, if she had, if they were critical of her or her partner's actions in the particular incident leading to this court case. Similar to the offender's interviews, victims were asked about the history of violence in their home of origin and the particular incident bringing the offender to court.\r\nThe probation reports provided information on the offender's criminal history, behavior in the community for the year while under supervision, and compliance with the batterer program.",

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThis study compared the adult criminal justice and child welfare system outcomes of four pathways through the juvenile justice system - Traditional Probation, Intensive Probation, Specialty Court Docket (Crossroads Program), and commitment to state youth correction services (Department of Youth Services). The study compared the effectiveness of a continuum of services and supervision in improving public safety, including re-arrest and re-incarceration, and in improving outcomes in engagement with child welfare as parents, including child welfare complaints and dispositions.\r\nThe core research question is: \"what is the relative effectiveness of four different juvenile justice interventions on improving public safety and child welfare outcomes?\" The study population is all youths (n=2581) who entered the juvenile court from 2004-2008. It then included 7-10 years of follow-up in the adult justice and child welfare systems for all youths.

The study compared the effectiveness of a continuum of services and supervision in improving public safety, including re-arrest and re-incarceration, and in improving outcomes in engagement with child welfare as parents, including child welfare complaints and dispositions.\r\nThe core research question is: \"what is the relative effectiveness of four different juvenile justice interventions on improving public safety and child welfare outcomes?\" The study population is all youths (n=2581) who entered the juvenile court from 2004-2008. It then included 7-10 years of follow-up in the adult justice and child welfare systems for all youths. The four interventions are on a continuum of intensity of services and supervision with Traditional Probation having the fewest services followed by Intensive Probation, Crossroads, and Division of Youth Services commitment.\r\nThe study's deposits include 14 SPSS data files:\r\n\r\narrest_final.sav\r\nCW_Custody_Adult_final.sav\r\nCW_Custody_child_final.sav\r\nCW_Intakes_Adult_final.sav\r\nCW_Intakes_child_final.sav\r\nCW_Placements_adult_final.sav\r\nCW_Placements_child_final.sav\r\nGeneral_final.sav\r\nJail_final.sav\r\nJC_charges_final.sav\r\nJC_detention_final.sav\r\nJC_disposition_final.sav\r\nJC_Gal_final.sav\r\nprison_final.sav\r\n",

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThe Multi-jurisdiction Research on Kiosk Supervision examined the prevalence of kiosk reporting, implementation experience of agencies using it, and outcomes and costs associated with its use. A telephone screener survey of 492 community supervision agencies nationally in 2012 identified 21 agencies currently using kiosk reporting, agencies that formerly used it, and those that considered but decided against using kiosk reporting. Telephone interviews with 30 agencies and site visits with five agencies measured the benefits and limitations of kiosk reporting and the issues for adopting and implementing kiosk reporting systems.

-            "description": "Child maltreatment is widely recognized as a severe crisis in the United States (Norman, Byambaa, Butchart, Scott, & Vos, 2012), incurring costs of $124 billion annually (Fang, Brown, Florence, & Mercy, 2012). Accordingly, children in the United States are frequently called to testify in criminal proceedings about their allegations (Hamblen & Levine, 1997). To effectively develop procedures that better distinguish true from false allegations, one must be equally concerned about false convictions and false acquittals; assessing best practices that minimize children's vulnerabilities and maximize competencies. To do so, the justice system must assess whether children are credible. As such, is necessary for the prosecutor to establish children's credibility, particularly by preempting or rebuffing concerns from the defense. Further, it is necessary for the defense to evaluate whether children's allegations are honest or suggestively influenced, productive, consistent and plausible. However, it is undetermined how to do this effectively. The purpose of the present investigation is to assess how children's credibility is established and questioned in courtroom investigations of sexual abuse allegations, with a particular focus on how children respond. It is expected that: 1) defense attorneys will use likely use subtle means to attack children's honesty and suggestibility, whereas prosecutors will ask overtly about such topics, 2) children will exhibit productivity differences depending on the questioner, 3) defense attorneys will frequently ask children specific questions about prior inconsistencies, 4) prosecutors will infrequently establish the plausibility of abuse, 5) prosecutors will infrequently preempt defense attorneys' concerns of credibility, and will only sometimes rebuff their attacks during re-direct examination, 6) both prosecutors and defense attorneys may ask developmentally inappropriate questions, and that 7) case characteristics will be related to questioning patterns. The proposed investigation will: develop an understanding of current prosecution and defense methods in cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse, contribute to prosecutors' abilities to effectively try such cases, providing concrete recommendations for defense attorneys when assessing children's credibility, and facilitate better decision making in cases of alleged child sexual abuse.",

Accordingly, children in the United States are frequently called to testify in criminal proceedings about their allegations (Hamblen & Levine, 1997). To effectively develop procedures that better distinguish true from false allegations, one must be equally concerned about false convictions and false acquittals; assessing best practices that minimize children's vulnerabilities and maximize competencies. To do so, the justice system must assess whether children are credible. As such, is necessary for the prosecutor to establish children's credibility, particularly by preempting or rebuffing concerns from the defense. Further, it is necessary for the defense to evaluate whether children's allegations are honest or suggestively influenced, productive, consistent and plausible. However, it is undetermined how to do this effectively. The purpose of the present investigation is to assess how children's credibility is established and questioned in courtroom investigations of sexual abuse allegations, with a particular focus on how children respond. It is expected that: 1) defense attorneys will use likely use subtle means to attack children's honesty and suggestibility, whereas prosecutors will ask overtly about such topics, 2) children will exhibit productivity differences depending on the questioner, 3) defense attorneys will frequently ask children specific questions about prior inconsistencies, 4) prosecutors will infrequently establish the plausibility of abuse, 5) prosecutors will infrequently preempt defense attorneys' concerns of credibility, and will only sometimes rebuff their attacks during re-direct examination, 6) both prosecutors and defense attorneys may ask developmentally inappropriate questions, and that 7) case characteristics will be related to questioning patterns.

Data collection for the longitudinal study consisted of conducting an additional wave of structured interviews with Somali youth (between the ages of 21-33); interviews included assessments of structural adversity (resettlement hardships, trauma exposure, and discrimination), social factors (connection to the resettlement community and/or Somali diaspora community, internet use, and level of acculturation) delinquency, gang involvement, civic engagement, and support for legal and illegal (violent) actions in support of political change. The researchers used latent transition analysis (LTA), generalized estimating equation modeling, and linear regression modeling to accomplish Aims 1-3. Aim 4 was accomplished by using a combination of open source data analysis, psychological autopsy and case analysis methodology. The researchers expanded our current in-depth case studies of Somali youth who left Minneapolis to join al-Shabaab (N = 23, males aged 22-30) to include those who joined ISIS or Al-Nusra (N=4, males aged 18-29). Research questions associated with Aim 4 were analyzed using a psychological autopsy method of developing case histories. Case histories were coded for themes and analyzed for convergence or divergence with case histories of youth who joined Al-Shabab. Scholarly products include manuscripts in journals relevant to criminal justice, policy briefs, and interim and final reports.

-            "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arrestee\r\nDrug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program/Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) Series\r\nis an expanded and redesigned version of the Drug Use Forecasting\r\n(DUF) program, which was upgraded methodologically and expanded to 35\r\ncities in 1998. The redesign was fully implemented beginning in the\r\nfirst quarter of 2000 using new sampling procedures that improved the\r\nquality and generalizability of the data. The DUF program began in\r\n1987 and was designed to estimate the prevalence of drug use among\r\npersons in the United States who are arrested and booked, and to\r\ndetect changes in trends in drug use among this population. The DUF\r\nprogram was a nonexperimental survey of drug use among adult male and\r\nfemale arrestees. In addition to supplying information on\r\nself-reported drug use, arrestees also provide a urine specimen, which\r\nis screened for the presence of ten illicit drugs.  Between 1987 and\r\n1997 the DUF program collected information in 24 sites across the\r\nUnited States, although the number of data collection sites varied\r\nslightly from year to year. Data collection took place four times a\r\nyear (once each calendar quarter) in each site and selection criteria\r\nand catchment areas (central city or county) varied from site to\r\nsite. The original DUF interview instrument (used for the 1987-1994\r\ndata and part of the 1995 data) elicited information about the use of\r\n22 drugs. A modified DUF interview instrument (used for part of the\r\n1995 data and all of the 1996-1999 data) included detailed questions\r\nabout each arrestee's use of 15 drugs. Juvenile data were added in\r\n1991. The ADAM program, redesigned from the DUF program, moved to a\r\nprobability-based sampling for the adult male population during\r\n2000. The shift to sampling of the adult male population in 2000\r\nrequired that all 35 sites move to a common catchment area, the\r\ncounty. The ADAM program also implemented a new and expanded adult\r\ninstrument in the first quarter of 2000, which was used for both the\r\nmale and female data. The term \"arrestee\" is used in the\r\ndocumentation, but because no identifying data are collected in the\r\ninterview setting, the data represent numbers of arrests rather than\r\nan unduplicated count of persons arrested.\r\nFunding\r\nThe\r\nNational Institute of Justice (NIJ) initiated ADAM in 1998 to replace\r\nDUF. In 2007, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)\r\ninitiated ADAM II.\r\n",

Juvenile data were added in\r\n1991. The ADAM program, redesigned from the DUF program, moved to a\r\nprobability-based sampling for the adult male population during\r\n2000. The shift to sampling of the adult male population in 2000\r\nrequired that all 35 sites move to a common catchment area, the\r\ncounty. The ADAM program also implemented a new and expanded adult\r\ninstrument in the first quarter of 2000, which was used for both the\r\nmale and female data. The term \"arrestee\" is used in the\r\ndocumentation, but because no identifying data are collected in the\r\ninterview setting, the data represent numbers of arrests rather than\r\nan unduplicated count of persons arrested.\r\nFunding\r\nThe\r\nNational Institute of Justice (NIJ) initiated ADAM in 1998 to replace\r\nDUF. In 2007, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)\r\ninitiated ADAM II.\r\n",

In particular, the\r\n project extended previous research on criminal careers by developing\r\n and applying an empirical model that accounted for the joint\r\n distribution of violent and nonviolent criminal offending by parolees\r\n in their late teens to mid-20s, during a newly recognized\r\n developmental period of the life course termed \"emerging adulthood.\"\r\n The individuals were released from the CYA at various ages from the\r\n late teens to early 20s, but were all followed for a seven-year\r\n post-parole period. For each individual, the researchers obtained\r\n information on counts of criminal arrests as well as information on\r\n exposure time. Violent arrests included murder, rape, aggravated\r\n assault, robbery, and other person offenses such as extortion and\r\n kidnapping. Nonviolent arrests included burglary, receiving stolen\r\n property, grand theft, forgery, and grand theft auto. Within each\r\n year, individuals were coded as \"free\" for the number of months that\r\n they were not serving time in jail, prison, or CYA\r\n detention. Involvement of the following life circumstances was\r\n recorded: (1) alcohol use, (2) heroin use, (3) full-time employment,\r\n and (4) marriage. A \"month-score\" indicating how many months the\r\n parolee was employed full-time during the course of each of the seven\r\n years of observation was also recorded. Offenders were assumed to have\r\n maintained the same status unless a change was noted in the California\r\n Department of Corrections files. In addition, the researchers\r\n developed an index to gauge an offender's stake in conformity by\r\n combining the life circumstances of marriage and full-time\r\n employment. Variables in the data include year of follow-up, race, age\r\n during that year of follow-up, number of months not serving time,\r\n stake in conformity index score, and number of arrests for violent\r\n offenses, nonviolent offenses, and total offenses. Dummy variables\r\n are provided on alcohol use, heroin use, use of mind-altering drugs,\r\n use of uppers/downers, dependence on alcohol or heroin, marital\r\nstatus, common-law marriage, and employment.",

The research goal\r\nof the first part of the study was to provide a systematic and\r\nempirical process evaluation of appropriate program placement and\r\nwhether and to what extent selected individual-level factors were\r\nrelated to key measures of program progress, as well as to variations\r\nin process outcomes across each of five treatment sites. The research\r\ngoal of the second part of the study was to provide a systematic and\r\nempirical outcome evaluation of the impact of the TYC Chemical\r\nDependency Treatment Program, including determination of the extent to\r\nwhich certain risk, need, amenability, program performance and\r\ndelivery, and aftercare factors affected treatment impact. Data were\r\nobtained from the Texas Youth Commission, the state corrections agency\r\nresponsible for serving violent and serious delinquent youth committed\r\nto the custody of the state. TYC collects a range of information on\r\nthe risk, needs, and treatment amenability of its youths. Also,\r\nprogram performance is measured through the use of an exit assessment\r\nconducted by program staff, which essentially provides a report card\r\nsummarizing each youth's involvement and progress in treatment. Data\r\nin this evaluation cover all juveniles who entered the CDTP from\r\nJanuary through October 1998, and who were discharged by April 1,\r\n1999. The treatment group consists of youths who invariably had a high\r\nneed for chemical dependency treatment. The control group consists of\r\nyouths who were eligible for treatment in the CDTP during this same\r\ntime period but who did not receive it due to limited CDTP bed\r\nspace. To obtain measures of drug use/abuse relapse, aftercare\r\nparticipation, and parole performance, a parolee data worksheet was\r\ncreated. TYC was able to provide information on who received chemical\r\ndependency treatment while on parole. Five core variables of the\r\nprocess evaluation data are program completion, program expulsion,\r\ndays to completion, days to expulsion, and number of behavior\r\ninfractions. The process evaluation includes the following variables\r\nfrom individual exit assessments: the youth's overall participation,\r\nwhether the youth understood the curriculum, understood addiction,\r\nsought help, acknowledged addiction, and acknowledged impact, the\r\nyouth's performance grade, whether the youth committed to be\r\ndrug-free, family involvement, special circumstances, and performance\r\nindex. Demographic variables are race, age, parents' marital status,\r\nand gender. Variables addressing risk factors include classifying\r\noffense, offender class, risk level, number of felony referrals,\r\nnumber of felony adjudications, number of previous TYC commitments,\r\nand number of parole revocations. Other variables in the process\r\nevaluation address the Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory\r\n(SASSI), the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) chemical\r\ndependency treatment need, TYC treatment amenability score, and the\r\nStages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale\r\n(SOCRATES).

-            "description": "This study examined the role of stalking in domestic\r\n violence crime reports produced by the Colorado Springs Police\r\n Department (CSPD). It provided needed empirical data on the prevalence\r\n of stalking in domestic violence crime reports, risk factors\r\n associated with intimate partner stalking, and police responses to\r\n reports of intimate partner stalking. The study was conducted jointly\r\n by the Justice Studies Center (JSC) at the University of Colorado at\r\n Colorado Springs and the Denver-based Center for Policy Research\r\n (CPR). JSC staff generated the sample and collected the data, and CPR\r\n staff processed and analyzed the data. The sample was generated from\r\n CSPD Domestic Violence Summons and Complaint (DVSC) forms, which were\r\n used by CSPD officers to investigate crime reports of victims and\r\n suspects who were or had been in an intimate relationship and where\r\n there was probable cause to believe a crime was committed. During\r\n January to September 1999, JSC staff reviewed and entered information\r\n from all 1998 DVSC forms into a computerized database as part of the\r\n evaluation process for Domestic Violence Enhanced Response Team\r\n (DVERT), a nationally recognized domestic violence prevention\r\n program. A subfile of reports initiated during April to September 1998\r\n was generated from this database and formed the basis for the study\r\n sample. The DVSC forms contained detailed information about the\r\n violation including victim and suspect relationship, type of violation\r\n committed, and specific criminal charges made by the police\r\n officer. The DVSC forms also contained written narratives by both the\r\n victim and the investigating officer, which provided detailed\r\n information about the events precipitating the report, including\r\n whether the suspect stalked the victim. The researchers classified a\r\n domestic violence crime report as having stalking allegations if the\r\n victim and/or police narrative specifically stated that the victim was\r\n stalked by the suspect, or if the victim and/or police narrative\r\n mentioned that the suspect engaged in stalking-like behaviors (e.g.,\r\n repeated following, face-to-face confrontations, or unwanted\r\n communications by phone, page, letter, fax, or e-mail). Demographic\r\n variables include victim-suspect relationship, and age, race, sex, and\r\n employment status of the victim and suspect. Variables describing the\r\n violation include type of violation committed, specific criminal\r\n charges made by the police officer, whether the alleged violation\r\n constituted a misdemeanor or a felony crime, whether a suspect was\r\n arrested, whether the victim sustained injuries, whether the victim\r\n received medical attention, whether the suspect used a firearm or\r\n other type of weapon, whether items were placed in evidence, whether\r\n the victim or suspect was using drugs and/or alcohol at the time of\r\n the incident, number and ages of children in the household, whether\r\n children were in the home at the time of the incident, and whether\r\n there was a no-contact or restraining order in effect against the\r\nsuspect at the time of the incident.",

-            "description": "This study examined the relationships among trends in\r\ndeadly gun violence, overall gun availability, and the availability of\r\nmore lethal types of guns. Using firearms confiscated by the Dallas,\r\nTexas, police department from 1980 to 1992 as indicators of the types\r\nof guns circulating among criminal/high-risk groups, the project\r\nexamined changes over time in Dallas' street gun arsenal and assessed\r\nthe impact these changes had upon gun violence mortality in\r\nDallas. The focus of the project was on the characteristics of the\r\nguns rather than their numbers. All confiscated firearms were analyzed\r\nand characterized according to basic weapon type and caliber\r\ngroupings. Dates of confiscation were missing from the majority of the\r\npre-1988 records, but by aggregating the gun data into bimonthly (Part\r\n1) and quarterly (Part 2) time series databases, it was possible to\r\nestimate the bimonthly and quarterly periods of confiscation for most\r\nof the 1980-1992 records. Records that could not be assigned to\r\nbimonthly or quarterly periods were dropped. Confiscated firearms were\r\ngrouped into basic categories based on stopping power (i.e., wounding\r\npotential), rate of fire, and ammunition capacity. The following\r\nmeasures were created for each bimonthly and quarterly period: (1)\r\nweapons with high stopping power (large guns), (2) semiautomatic\r\nweaponry (semis), (3) weapons combining high stopping power and a\r\nsemiautomatic firing mechanism (large semis), (4) handguns with high\r\nstopping power (large handguns), (5) semiautomatic handguns (semi\r\nhandguns), and (6) handguns combining high stopping power and\r\nsemiautomatic firing (large semi handguns). Several violence measures\r\nwere obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform\r\nCrime Reports Supplemental Homicide Reports and Return A (or Offenses\r\nKnown and Clearances by Arrest) data files (see UNIFORM CRIME\r\nREPORTING PROGRAM DATA [UNITED STATES]: 1975-1997 [ICPSR 9028]). These\r\nmeasures were also aggregated at bimonthly and quarterly levels. Data\r\nfrom the Dallas Police Department master gun property file include\r\ntotal handguns, total semiautomatic handguns, total large-caliber\r\nhandguns, total large-caliber semiautomatic handguns, total shotguns,\r\ntotal semiautomatic shotguns, total rifles, total semiautomatic\r\nrifles, and total counts and total semiautomatic counts for various\r\ncalibers of handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Data that were aggregated\r\nusing the FBI data include total homicides, gun homicides, total\r\nrobberies, gun robberies, and gun aggravated assaults. The data file\r\nalso includes the year and the bimonthly or quarterly period counter.",

Using firearms confiscated by the Dallas,\r\nTexas, police department from 1980 to 1992 as indicators of the types\r\nof guns circulating among criminal/high-risk groups, the project\r\nexamined changes over time in Dallas' street gun arsenal and assessed\r\nthe impact these changes had upon gun violence mortality in\r\nDallas. The focus of the project was on the characteristics of the\r\nguns rather than their numbers. All confiscated firearms were analyzed\r\nand characterized according to basic weapon type and caliber\r\ngroupings. Dates of confiscation were missing from the majority of the\r\npre-1988 records, but by aggregating the gun data into bimonthly (Part\r\n1) and quarterly (Part 2) time series databases, it was possible to\r\nestimate the bimonthly and quarterly periods of confiscation for most\r\nof the 1980-1992 records. Records that could not be assigned to\r\nbimonthly or quarterly periods were dropped. Confiscated firearms were\r\ngrouped into basic categories based on stopping power (i.e., wounding\r\npotential), rate of fire, and ammunition capacity. The following\r\nmeasures were created for each bimonthly and quarterly period: (1)\r\nweapons with high stopping power (large guns), (2) semiautomatic\r\nweaponry (semis), (3) weapons combining high stopping power and a\r\nsemiautomatic firing mechanism (large semis), (4) handguns with high\r\nstopping power (large handguns), (5) semiautomatic handguns (semi\r\nhandguns), and (6) handguns combining high stopping power and\r\nsemiautomatic firing (large semi handguns). Several violence measures\r\nwere obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform\r\nCrime Reports Supplemental Homicide Reports and Return A (or Offenses\r\nKnown and Clearances by Arrest) data files (see UNIFORM CRIME\r\nREPORTING PROGRAM DATA [UNITED STATES]: 1975-1997 [ICPSR 9028]). These\r\nmeasures were also aggregated at bimonthly and quarterly levels. Data\r\nfrom the Dallas Police Department master gun property file include\r\ntotal handguns, total semiautomatic handguns, total large-caliber\r\nhandguns, total large-caliber semiautomatic handguns, total shotguns,\r\ntotal semiautomatic shotguns, total rifles, total semiautomatic\r\nrifles, and total counts and total semiautomatic counts for various\r\ncalibers of handguns, shotguns, and rifles. Data that were aggregated\r\nusing the FBI data include total homicides, gun homicides, total\r\nrobberies, gun robberies, and gun aggravated assaults. The data file\r\nalso includes the year and the bimonthly or quarterly period counter.",

This site was selected because it was one\r\n of the earliest boot camps in the nation designed specifically for\r\n juvenile offenders. The program enrolled only male offenders between\r\n the ages of 16 and 18, who were either documented or alleged drug\r\n users with sustained petitions by the juvenile courts for non-violent\r\n and non-sex offenses. The main goal of the study was to use a\r\n combination of official and self-report measures to assess the\r\n effectiveness of the DTBC as a correctional model for juvenile\r\n offenders with a focus on their substance-abusing behavior. The study\r\n consisted of three independent data collection components: (1) a\r\n comparison of official recidivism rates between matched boot camp\r\n graduates and non-boot camp graduates over a five-year observation\r\n period (Part 1, Official Records Data for Matched Samples), (2) a\r\n cross-sectional comparison of self-reports between boot camp and\r\n non-boot camp graduates over a 12-month observation period (Part 2,\r\n Twelve-Month Self-Report Data), and (3) a pre- and post-test of a boot\r\n camp cohort over a six-month observation period (Part 3, Pre- and\r\n Post-Test Self-Report Data). Part 1 variables include camp entry and\r\n exit dates, sustained petition for camp entry, prior arrests, age at\r\n first arrest, most serious charge at first arrest, number of post-camp\r\n arrests, most serious charge for post-camp arrests, and number of\r\n probation violations post-camp. For Parts 2 and 3, the study utilized\r\n the well-established International Self-Report Delinquency\r\n questionnaire to assess the youths' post-camp delinquent\r\n activities. The instrument contained measures on (1) the types of\r\n crimes committed during a specified time frame, (2) the frequency of\r\n these delinquent acts, (3) the onset of each admitted offense, (4) the\r\n circumstances of the incidents, and (5) a set of sociodemographic\r\n variables including attitudes toward school and work, living\r\n arrangement, and circle of friends.

Research\r\nwas conducted in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1996 and in St. Petersburg,\r\nFlorida, in 1997. Several research methods were employed: systematic\r\nobservation of patrol officers (Parts 1-4) and patrol supervisors (Parts\r\n5-14), in-person interviews with patrol officers (Part 15) and supervisors\r\n(Parts 16-17), and telephone surveys of residents in selected neighborhoods\r\n(Part 18). Field researchers accompanied their assigned patrol or\r\nsupervising officer during all activities and encounters with the public\r\nduring the shift. Field researchers noted when various activities and\r\nencounters with the public occurred during these \"ride-alongs,\" who was\r\ninvolved, and what happened. In the resulting data files coded observation\r\ndata are provided at the ride level, the activity level (actions that did\r\nnot involve interactions with citizens), the encounter level (events in\r\nwhich officers interacted with citizens), and the citizen level. In\r\naddition to encounters with citizens, supervisors also engaged in\r\nencounters with patrol officers. Patrol officers and patrol supervisors in\r\nboth Indianapolis and St. Petersburg were interviewed one-on-one in a\r\nprivate interviewing room during their regular work shifts. Citizens in the\r\nPOPN study beats were randomly selected for telephone surveys to determine\r\ntheir views about problems in their neighborhoods and other community\r\nissues. Administrative records were used to create site identification\r\ndata (Part 19) and data on staffing (Part 20). This data collection also\r\nincludes data compiled from census records, aggregated to the beat level\r\nfor each site (Part 21). Census data were also used to produce district\r\npopulations for both sites (Part 22). Citizen data were aggregated to the\r\nencounter level to produce counts of various citizen role categories and\r\ncharacteristics and characteristics of the encounter between the patrol\r\nofficer and citizens in the various encounters (Part 23). Ride-level data\r\n(Parts 1, 5, and 10) contain information about characteristics of the ride,\r\nincluding start and end times, officer identification, type of unit, and\r\nbeat assignment. Activity data (Parts 2, 6, and 11) include type of\r\nactivity, where and when the activity took place, who was present, and how\r\nthe officer was notified. Encounter data (Parts 3, 7, and 12) contain\r\ndescriptive information on encounters similar to the activity data (i.e.,\r\nlocation, initiation of encounter). Citizen data (Parts 4, 8, and 13)\r\nprovide citizen characteristics, citizen behavior, and police behavior\r\ntoward citizens. Similarly, officer data from the supervisor observations\r\n(Parts 9 and 14) include characteristics of the supervising officer and the\r\nnature of the interaction between the officers. Both the patrol officer and\r\nsupervisor interview data (Parts 15-17) include the officers' demographics,\r\ntraining and knowledge, experience, perceptions of their beats and\r\norganizational environment, and beliefs about the police role. The patrol\r\nofficer data also provide the officers' perceptions of their supervisors\r\nwhile the supervisor data describe supervisors' perceptions of their\r\nsubordinates, as well as their views about their roles, power, and\r\npriorities as supervisors. Data from surveyed citizens (Part 18) provide\r\ninformation about their neighborhoods, including years in the neighborhood,\r\ndistance to various places in the neighborhood, neighborhood problems and\r\neffectiveness of police response to those problems, citizen knowledge of,\r\nor interactions with, the police, satisfaction with police services, and\r\nfriends and relatives in the neighborhood. Citizen demographics and\r\ngeographic and weight variables are also included. Site identification\r\nvariables (Part 19) include ride and encounter numbers, site beat (site,\r\ndistrict, and beat or community policing areas [CPA]), and sector. Staffing\r\nvariables (Part 20) include district, shift, and staffing levels for\r\nvarious shifts. Census data (Part 21) include neighborhood, index of\r\nsocioeconomic distress, total population, and total white\r\npopulation. District population variables (Part 22) include district and\r\npopulation of district.

FVPSA was\r\n enacted to assist states in (1) developing and maintaining programs\r\n for the prevention of family violence and for the provision of shelter\r\n to victims and their dependents and (2) providing training and\r\n technical assistance for personnel who provide services for victims of\r\n family violence. The National Institute of Justice awarded a grant to\r\n the Urban Institute in late 1992 to evaluate the police training\r\n projects. One of the program evaluation methods the Urban Institute\r\n used was to conduct surveys of victims in New York and Texas. The\r\n primary objectives of the survey were to find out, from victims who\r\n had contact with law enforcement officers in the pre-training period\r\n and/or in the post-training period, what their experiences and\r\n evaluations of law enforcement services were, how police interventions\r\n had changed over time, and how the quality of services and changes\r\n related to the police training funded under the FVPSA. Following the\r\n conclusion of training, victims of domestic assault in New York and\r\n Texas were surveyed through victim service programs across each\r\n state. Similar, but not identical, instruments were used at the two\r\n sites. Service providers were asked to distribute the questionnaires\r\n to victims of physical or sexual abuse who had contact with law\r\n enforcement officers. The survey instruments were developed to obtain\r\n information and victim perceptions of\r\n the following key subject areas: history of abuse, characteristics of\r\n the victim-abuser relationship, demographic characteristics of the\r\n abuser and the victim, history of law enforcement contacts, \r\n services\r\n received from law enforcement officers, and victims' evaluations of\r\n these services. Variables on history of\r\n abuse include types of abuse experienced, first and last time\r\n physically or sexually abused, and frequency of abuse. Characteristics\r\n of the victim-abuser relationship include length of involvement with\r\n the abuser, living arrangement and relationship status at time of last\r\n abuse, number of children the victim had, and number of\r\n children at home at the time of last abuse. Demographic variables\r\n provide age, race/ethnicity, employment status, and education level of\r\n the abuser and the victim. Variables on the history of law enforcement\r\n contacts and services received include number of times law\r\n enforcement officers were called because of assaults on the victim,\r\n number of times law enforcement officers actually came to the\r\n scene, first and last time officers came to the scene, number of times\r\n officers were involved because of assaults on the victim, number of\r\n times officers were involved in the last 12 months, and type of\r\n law enforcement agencies the officers were from. Data are also included on\r\n city size by population, city median household income, county\r\n population density, county crime rate, and region of state of the\r\n responding law enforcement agencies. Over 30 variables record the\r\n victims' evaluations of the officers' responsiveness, helpfulness, and\r\nattitudes.",

In the long term, Weed and Seed programs are intended\r\n to reduce levels of crime, violence, drug trafficking, and fear of\r\n crime, and to create new jobs, improve housing, enhance the quality of\r\n neighborhood life, and reduce alcohol and drug use. This baseline data\r\n collection effort is the initial step toward assessing the achievement\r\n of the long-term objectives. The evaluation was conducted using a\r\n quasi-experimental design, matching households in comparison\r\n neighborhoods with the Weed and Seed target neighborhoods. Comparison\r\n neighborhoods were chosen to match Weed and Seed target neighborhoods\r\n on the basis of crime rates, population demographics, housing\r\n characteristics, and size and density. Neighborhoods in eight sites\r\n were selected: Akron, OH, Bradenton (North Manatee), FL, Hartford, CT,\r\n Las Vegas, NV, Pittsburgh, PA, Salt Lake City, UT, Seattle, WA, and\r\n Shreveport, LA. The \"neighborhood\" in Hartford, CT, was actually a\r\n public housing development, which is part of the reason for the\r\n smaller number of interviews at this site. Baseline data collection\r\n tasks included the completion of in-person surveys with residents in\r\n the target and matched comparison neighborhoods, and the provision of\r\n guidance to the sites in the collection of important process data on a\r\n routine uniform basis. The survey questions can be broadly divided\r\n into these areas: (1) respondent demographics, (2) household size and\r\n income, (3) perceptions of the neighborhood, and (4) perceptions of\r\n city services. Questions addressed in the course of gathering the\r\n baseline data include: Are the target and comparison areas\r\n sufficiently well-matched that analytic contrasts between the areas\r\n over time are valid? Is there evidence that the survey measures are\r\n accurate and valid measures of the dependent variables of interest --\r\n fear of crime, victimization, etc.? Are the sample sizes and response\r\n rates sufficient to provide ample statistical power for later\r\n analyses? Variables cover respondents' perceptions of the\r\n neighborhood, safety and observed security measures, police\r\n effectiveness, and city services, as well as their ratings of\r\n neighborhood crime, disorder, and other problems. Other items included\r\n respondents' experiences with victimization, calls/contacts with\r\n police and satisfaction with police response, and involvement in\r\n community meetings and events. Demographic information on respondents\r\n includes year of birth, gender, ethnicity, household income, and\r\nemployment status.",

The researchers sought to\r\ndescribe the magnitude, role, and nature of thrift crime, analyze\r\nfactors related to the effectiveness of law enforcement control of\r\nsavings and loan fraud, and develop the broader implications, from\r\nboth a theoretical and a policy perspective. Data consist of\r\nstatistics from various government agencies and focus on all types of\r\nthrift, i.e., solvent and insolvent, that fell under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Office of Thrift Supervision in Florida, Texas, and California\r\nand all insolvent thrifts under the control of the Resolution Trust\r\nCorporation (RTC) in Washington, DC. The study focused on Texas,\r\nCalifornia, and Florida because of the high numbers of savings and\r\nloan failures, instances of fraud, and executives being\r\nindicted. However, as the study progressed, it became clear that the\r\nfrauds and failures were nationwide, and while many of the crimes were\r\nlocated in these three states, the individuals involved may have been\r\nlocated elsewhere. Thus, the scope of the study was expanded to\r\nprovide a national perspective. Parts 1 and 2, Case and Defendant\r\nData, provide information from the Executive Office of United States\r\nAttorneys on referrals, investigations, and prosecutions of thrifts,\r\nbanks, and other financial institutions. Part 1 consists of data about\r\nthe cases that were prosecuted, the number of institutions victimized,\r\nthe state in which these occurred, and the seriousness of the offense\r\nas indicated by the dollar loss and the number of victims. Part 2\r\nprovides information on the defendant's position in the institution\r\n(director, officer, employee, borrower, customer, developer, lawyer,\r\nor shareholder) and disposition (fines, restitution, prison,\r\nprobation, or acquittal). The relevant variables associated with the\r\nResolution Trust Corporation (Part 3, Institution Data) describe\r\nindictments, convictions, and sentences for all cases in the\r\nrespective regions, organizational structure and behavior for a single\r\ninstitution, and the estimated loss to the institution. Variables\r\ncoded are ownership type, charter, home loans, brokered deposits, net\r\nworth, number of referrals, number of individuals referred, assets and\r\nasset growth, ratio of direct investments to total assets, and total\r\ndollar losses due to fraud. For Parts 4 and 5, Texas and California\r\nReferral Data, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) provided data\r\nfor what are called Category I referrals for California and\r\nTexas. Part 4 covers Category I referrals for Texas. Variables include\r\nthe individual's position in the institution, the number of referrals,\r\nand the sum of dollar losses from all referrals.

It was carried out in\r\n collaboration with seven national youth-serving organizations: Boys\r\n and Girls Clubs of America, Boy Scouts of America, Girls Incorporated,\r\n Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., National Association of Police Athletic\r\n Leagues, National 4-H Council and United States Department of\r\n Agriculture 4-H and Youth Development Service, and YMCA of the\r\n U.S.A. The research involved a national survey of affiliates and\r\n charter members of these organizations.

In particular, it is a\r\n study of children's social and psychological development from birth to\r\n young adulthood in urban neighborhoods. This collection contains data\r\n from a cross-sectional survey of Chicago residents in 1994 and is the\r\n first product of an eight-year project. The survey gathered\r\n information from adult residents of Chicago on their perceptions of\r\n the neighborhoods in which they live. The survey questionnaire was a\r\n multidimensional assessment of the structural conditions and\r\n organization of the neighborhoods. Data collection consisted of a\r\n household interview of residents aged 18 and older to assess key\r\n neighborhood dimensions, including the dynamic structure of the local\r\n community, organizational and political structure, cultural values,\r\n informal social control, formal social control, and social\r\n cohesion. Variables include measures of the best and worst aspects of\r\n living in Chicago, how long residents had lived in a particular\r\n neighborhood, characteristics of their neighborhood, including types\r\n of social service agencies available, and if they would consider\r\n moving to a different neighborhood and why. Other community variables\r\n measure the relationships among neighbors, including how many\r\n neighbors a respondent would recognize, how often neighbors\r\n socialized, and how often neighbors participated in other activities\r\n together. Variables that capture neighborhood social order include\r\n respondents' perceptions of neighborhood problems such as litter,\r\n graffiti, drinking, drugs, and excessive use of force by police.\r\n Respondents were also asked about their normative beliefs regarding\r\n violence, money, and various children's behaviors. Victimization\r\n variables cover how often the respondent was the victim of a fight\r\n with a weapon, a violent argument, a gang fight, sexual assault,\r\n robbery, theft, or vandalism. Other variables measure fear of crime\r\n and attitudes toward the police. Demographic variables include age,\r\n gender, education, living arrangement, national origin, and employment\r\n status. In addition, a number of scales created by the study's\r\n scientific directors are included such as social disorder, perceived\r\n neighborhood danger, and neighborhood activism. Part 1 of this study\r\n contains individual responses to survey questions. Part 2 contains\r\n data aggregated to the neighborhood cluster (NC) level (see Study\r\n Design for explanation of NC).

-            "description": "For this program evaluation, which utilized a randomized\r\nfield experiment, two separate substudies were conducted: one\r\ninvestigated the \"front door\" Intensive Community Supervision (ICS)\r\nprogram that diverted prisoners into the community at the beginning of\r\ntheir prison terms, and the other studied the \"back door\" Intensive\r\nSupervised Release (ISR) program that provided enhanced supervision\r\nservices for offenders who were just finishing their terms of\r\nconfinement and had a residential mandate upon release from\r\nprison. The random assignment procedure began in October 1990 and\r\ncontinued until June 1992. Prison caseworkers in the Office of Adult\r\nRelease (OAR) within the Minnesota Department of Corrections screened\r\noffenders for participation in the prison diversion program (ICS)\r\naccording to established criteria. The RAND coordinator assigned\r\noffenders to the experimental program or to the control program\r\n(prison) by consulting a predetermined random list of assignments. For\r\nthe ISR program, institutional caseworkers reviewed the treatment\r\nplans for offenders who were scheduled to be released from prison\r\nwithin the next six months. The same procedure for random assignment\r\nwas used as in the ICS study. The final sample sizes were 124 in the\r\nICS program and 176 in the ISR program. Parts 1 and 9, Background\r\nData, include demographic information such as sex, race, education,\r\nmarital status, number of dependents, and living arrangement at time\r\nof most recent arrest. Also included is information on the offender's\r\nprior employment history, drug use prior to drug treatment, status\r\nafter random assignment, various probation/parole/release conditions\r\nordered, and criminal record information for prior arrests, for the\r\ngoverning offense and for the offense immediately prior to the current\r\nprison admission. Each offender was also rated on various items\r\nrelating to risk of recidivism and need for treatment. The 6-month,\r\n12-month, and 13-month review data (Parts 2-4 and 10-12) record the\r\nsame information for each month. Variables provide information on the\r\ncurrent status of the offender, days under regular supervision,\r\nintensive community supervision, special services, electronic\r\nsurveillance, detention or incarceration (jail or prison), and days on\r\nother status. Information was also recorded for each month during the\r\nreview regarding number and type of face-to-face contacts, number and\r\ntype of phone contacts, number of drug tests taken, number and type of\r\nmonitoring checks performed, number and type of sessions in\r\ncounseling, number of days job hunting or in training, hours of\r\ncommunity service, number of days employed and amount of earnings,\r\namount of fines and court costs paid, amount of victim restitution\r\npaid, and amount of probation fees paid. Because a large percentage of\r\nthe ICS control offenders were expected to remain in prison during a\r\n12-month follow-up (resulting in premature recidivism outcomes),\r\nrecidivism data for all ICS offenders were collected for a period of\r\n24 months after assignment to the study (Part 5). Part 5 contains up\r\nto three status codes and number of days at each status for months\r\n1-25 for the ICS cases only. Also included is information on work\r\nrelease, violations of supervision, absconding, returns to jail,\r\nreturns to prison, and other releases. Parts 6 and 13 provide drug\r\nviolation data, including first and second type of drug, action taken,\r\nand number of days since random assignment. Parts 7 and 14 provide\r\ntechnical violation data, including technical violation, first,\r\nsecond, and third action taken, days from assignment to each action,\r\nand most serious action taken. Finally, Parts 8 and 15 provide arrest\r\ndata, including arrest code, age at arrest, if convicted, conviction\r\ncode, type of sentence, and age at disposition. Dates were converted\r\nby RAND to time-lapse variables for the public release files for\r\npurposes of time-at-risk analysis.",

Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences.

Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One of\r\n the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Child\r\n Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL protocol, administered to parents\r\n or primary caregivers, was first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and\r\n has been one of the most widely used standardized measures in child\r\n psychology for evaluating maladaptive behavioral and emotional\r\n problems in preschool subjects aged 2 to 3 or in subjects between the\r\n ages of 4 and 18. The CBCL was administered to primary caregivers of\r\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of the Longitudinal\r\n Cohort Study. It assessed internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressive,\r\n and overcontrolled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactive,\r\n noncompliant, and undercontrolled) behaviors. Several subareas were\r\n measured including social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety and\r\n depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems,\r\n aggressive behavior, and delinquent behaviors. The Wave 3 version of\r\n the instrument is nearly identical to the Wave 2 version, which was\r\n administered to Cohorts 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (PROJECT ON HUMAN\r\n DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): CHILD BEHAVIOR\r\n CHECKLIST, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 [ICPSR 13611]). The Wave 3 version\r\n contains a question regarding cruelty to animals that was not present\r\nin the Wave 2 version for Cohorts 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.",
