+            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident, itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\nWindow Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\ncomplete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\ngeneral, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\noccurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\noccurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\nUCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

Records of offenders who exit federal prison temporarily, such as for transit to another location, to serve a weekend sentence, or for health care, are not included in the exiting cohort. These data include variables that describe the offender, such as age, race, citizenship, as well as variables that describe the sentences and expected prison terms.

These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 7.9-7.16.

The Return A Supplement requires that a value be established for property stolen and recovered in each Crime Index category except aggravated assault. It is designed to record the value of property stolen and recovered in the following eleven classifications: Currency/notes, Jewelry and Precious Metals, Clothing and Furs, Locally Stolen Motor Vehicles, Office Equipment, Televisions/Radios, Firearms, Household Goods, Consumable Goods, Livestock, and Miscellaneous. The determination of the value of property stolen is an obligation of the investigating officer, and such information is essential to assure the completeness of a law enforcement investigative report on stolen property. The data were originally assembled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from reports submitted by agencies participating in the UCR.

The Return A Supplement requires that a value be established for property stolen and recovered in each Crime Index category except aggravated assault. It is designed to record the value of property stolen and recovered in the following eleven classifications: Currency/notes, Jewelry and Precious Metals, Clothing and Furs, Locally Stolen Motor Vehicles, Office Equipment, Televisions/Radios, Firearms, Household Goods, Consumable Goods, Livestock, and Miscellaneous. The determination of the value of property stolen is an obligation of the investigating officer, and such information is essential to assure the completeness of a law enforcement investigative report on stolen property. The data were originally assembled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from reports submitted by agencies participating in the UCR. The ICPSR file was processed from Return A Supplement files provided by the FBI.",

NIBRS data as formatted by the FBI are stored in a\r\nsingle file. These data are organized by various segment levels\r\n(record types). There are six main segment levels: administrative,\r\noffense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment level\r\nhas a different length and layout. There are other segment levels that\r\noccur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significant\r\ncomputing resources are necessary to work with the data in its\r\nsingle-file format. In addition, the user must be sophisticated in\r\nworking with data in complex file types. For these reasons and the\r\ndesire to facilitate the use of NIBRS data, ICPSR created the extract\r\nfiles.

The Act requires a 10 percent sample of juvenile facilities to be listed by incidence of sexual assault.

The Older Youth questionnaire was administered to youths ages 15 and up, and the Younger Youth questionnaire was administered to those 14 and younger. The survey was divided into five sections. Section A collected background information, such as details of admission to facility and demographics including education, height, weight, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and history of any forced sexual contact. Section B, Facility Perceptions and Victimization, included respondents' opinions of the facility and staff, any incidence of gang activity, and any injuries that had occurred. Section C, Sexual Activity Within Facility, captured the types of sexual contact that occurred and the circumstances of sexual contact. Section D, Description of Event(s) with Youth, and Section E, Description of Event(s) with Staff, focused on when and where the contact occurred, the race and gender of the other youths or staff members, if threats or coercion were involved, and outcomes, including whether or not the sexual contact was reported.\r\nOther variables include debriefing questions about respondents' experiences completing the survey, interviewer observations, created variables to summarize victimization reports (due to the complicated routing in Section C), weight and stratification data, and administrative data about the facilities.",

UCR Program contributors compile and submit their crime data by one of two means: either directly to the FBI or through their State UCR Programs. State UCR Programs frequently impose mandatory reporting requirements which have been effective in increasing both the number of reporting agencies as well as the number and accuracy of each participating agency's reports.

These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\nCrime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\nmanslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\nproperty crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\nBy congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\nin 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\nattempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\npublic building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\nanother, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\nof arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\narrest or other means.

The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines.

Prior to 2013 the data were archived and distributed as 13 separate data files, including three separate batch header record files.

To fill\r\n this research gap, this project created a data series that spans two\r\n centuries on homicides per capita for the city of Los Angeles. The\r\n goal was to create a site-specific, individual-based data series that\r\n could be used to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such\r\n as mass immigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and\r\n changes in laws. The basic approach to the data collection was to\r\n obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts and the most\r\n complete information on individual homicides. Data were derived from\r\n multiple sources, including Los Angeles court records, as well as\r\n annual reports of the coroner and daily newspapers. Part 1 (Annual\r\n Homicides and Related Data) variables include Los Angeles County\r\n annual counts of homicides, counts of female victims, method of\r\n killing such as drowning, suffocating, or strangling, and the homicide\r\n rate. Part 2 (Individual Homicide Data) variables include the date and\r\n place of the murder, the age, sex, race, and place of birth of the\r\noffender and victim, type of weapon used, and source of data.",

Seven main classifications of crime were\r\nchosen to gauge fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of\r\ncrime. These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\nCrime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\nmanslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\nproperty crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\nBy congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\nin 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\nattempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\npublic building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\nanother, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\nof arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\narrest or other means. The counts include all reports of arson\r\nreceived from victims, officers who discovered infractions, or other\r\nsources.",

These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\nCrime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\nmanslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\nproperty crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\nBy congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\nin 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\nattempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\npublic building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\nanother, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\nof arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\narrest or other means.

The Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk (LEAIC) file facilitates linking reported crime data with socio-economic data. It does this by having a record for each law enforcement agency, law enforcement reporting entity, and access identifier for the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Essentially, if an entity (law enforcement agency or section of a law enforcement agency) is capable of reporting crime information, it is included in the file.  The LEAIC records contain common match keys for merging reported crime data and Census Bureau data. These linkage variables include the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) code, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county and place codes, and Governments Integrated Directory government identifier codes.",

Essentially, if an entity (law enforcement agency or section of a law enforcement agency) is capable of reporting crime information, it is included in the file.  The LEAIC records contain common match keys for merging reported crime data and Census Bureau data. These linkage variables include the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) code, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county and place codes, and Governments Integrated Directory government identifier codes.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). The NEISS-AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

+            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). The NEISS-AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them.

Both monthly and annual counts of these are available.\r\n Finally, as an aid to the user, each agency is identified by its FBI\r\n \"ORI Code\" as well as a sequential case number produced and documented\r\n by ICPSR in the codebook's appendix. Cases also may be identified by\r\n geographic region, state, SMSA, county, population size and group, and\r\nfrequency of reporting.",

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2020. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 38090.",

The NSVSP provides a critical opportunity to address the existing knowledge gaps and enhance the victim services field to better serve the needs of crime victims. It collected detailed information on the number of victims served by type of crime, victim characteristics, services provided, criminal justice and community relationships, service gaps, and VSP staff size, turnover, and characteristics.",

It is part of BJS's Victim Services Statistical Research Program that aims to provide comprehensive information about what services are being provided to victims, who is being served, and what gaps in service delivery may exist. The NSVSP provides a critical opportunity to address the existing knowledge gaps and enhance the victim services field to better serve the needs of crime victims. It collected detailed information on the number of victims served by type of crime, victim characteristics, services provided, criminal justice and community relationships, service gaps, and VSP staff size, turnover, and characteristics.",

Records of offenders who exit federal prison temporarily, such as for transit to another location, to serve a weekend sentence, or for health care, are not included in the exiting cohort.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction. These data are part of a series designed by Abt and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by Abt.",

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1-STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. These data are part of a series designed by Abt and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by Abt.",

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

+            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) expanded the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and causes of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States hospitals with emergency departments (EDs). This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is one of two national indicators of crime in the U.S. Historically, NCVS estimates of crime were not available at the state or local level because, prior to 2016, the NCVS sample was designed to exclusively produce national estimates. It is important to be able to understand victimization and victimization risk at the local level to inform and improve crime prevention efforts, investigation and victim response practices, and the location and mix of victim services.\r\nTo protect respondent confidentiality, with a few exceptions, subnational identifiers are traditionally not included on NCVS public-use files. Instead, information required to conduct analyses of crime at subnational levels must be accessed through a Federal Statistical Research Data Center (FSRDC) by obtaining Special Sworn Status from the U.S. Census Bureau. To provide a greater number of analysts with access to NCVS subnational data, in 2007 the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) released a public-use file containing person- and incident-level data from 1979-2004 for the \"core\" counties (i.e., self-representing PSUs) within the 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). To accommodate interest from analysts and other interested parties in updating the file with more recent data, BJS has created public-use files for the 52 largest MSAs covering the 2000-2015 survey years.\r\nThe 52 MSAs included on these files are those with a 2015 population of 1 million or more persons and an average annual NCVS sample size of at least 250 persons during the period of 2006-2015. While some of the MSAs from these files were also included on the 1979-2004 version, the definitions used to define MSAs are not the same. The 1979-2004 files were based on the \"core\" counties that were common to the MSA definitions determined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the 1970-, 1980-, and 1990-based NCVS sample designs. For the current files (i.e., 2000-2015), MSA definitions are based on the most recent delineation files available from OMB at the time of data collection for each survey year included on the files.",

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts' (AOUSC) Court of Appeals file. These contain variables on the nature of the criminal appeal, the underlying offense, and the disposition of the appeal. An appeal can be filed by the government or the offender, and the appellant can appeal the sentence, the verdict, or both sentence and verdict. Appeals may be terminated on the merits or on procedural grounds. Of those that are terminated on the merits, the district court ruling may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to criminal court, or dismissed. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were either removed, coarsened, or blanked in order to protect the identities of individuals.

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations. There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing, due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were either removed, coarsened, or blanked in order to protect the identities of individuals.

The 2019 CCF consisted of two data collection instruments - one for confinement facilities and one for community-based facilities. For each facility, information was provided on facility operator; sex of prisoners authorized to be housed by facility; facility functions; percentage of prisoners authorized to leave the facility; one-day counts of prisoners by sex, race/ethnicity, special populations, and holding authority; number of walkaways occurring over a one-year period; and educational and other special programs offered to prisoners. Additional information was collected from confinement facilities, including physical security level; housing for special populations; capacity; court orders for specific conditions; one-day count of correctional staff by payroll status and sex; one-day count of security staff by sex and race/ethnicity; assaults and incidents caused by prisoners; number of escapes occurring over a one-year period; and work assignments available to prisoners. Late in the data collection to avoid complete nonresponse from facilities, BJS offered the option of providing critical data elements from the two data collection instruments. These elements included facility operator; sex of prisoners authorized to be housed by facility; facility functions; percentage of prisoners authorized to leave the facility; one-day counts of prisoners by sex, and holding authority.
