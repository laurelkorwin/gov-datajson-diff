This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.",

The SFS asked questions related to victims' experiences with fraud. These responses are linked to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) survey instrument responses for a more complete understanding of the individual victim's circumstances.\r\nThe 2017 Supplemental Fraud Survey (SFS) was the first implementation of this supplement to the annual NCVS to obtain specific information about fraud-related victimization and disorder on a national level. Since the SFS is a supplement to the NCVS, it is conducted under the authority of Title 34, United States Code, section 10132. Only Census employees sworn to preserve confidentiality may see the completed questionnaires.",

White-collar crime was defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) as: \"any violation of law committed through non-violent means, involving lies, omissions, deceit, misrepresentation, or violation of a position of trust, by an individual or organization for personal or organizational benefit.\" SAG sought to analyze how attorneys general offices as an organization in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories respond to white-collar offenses in their jurisdiction.\r\nBJS asked respondents to focus on the following criminal and civil offenses: bank fraud, consumer fraud, insurance fraud, medical fraud, securities fraud, tax fraud, environmental offenses, false claims and statements, illegal payments to governmental officials (giving or receiving), unfair trade practices, and workplace-related offenses (e.g., unsafe working conditions). Variables included whether or not offices handled criminal or civil cases in the above categories, estimated number of cases in each category, and what types of criminal or civil sanctions were imposed on white-collar offenders. Researchers also assessed collaboration with partners outside of state attorneys offices, whether cases were referred for federal or local prosecution, and what circumstances lead to referring cases to state regulatory agencies. The extent to which state attorneys offices maintain white-collar crime data was also recorded.",

White-collar crime was defined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) as: \"any violation of law committed through non-violent means, involving lies, omissions, deceit, misrepresentation, or violation of a position of trust, by an individual or organization for personal or organizational benefit.\" SAG sought to analyze how attorneys general offices as an organization in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories respond to white-collar offenses in their jurisdiction.\r\nBJS asked respondents to focus on the following criminal and civil offenses: bank fraud, consumer fraud, insurance fraud, medical fraud, securities fraud, tax fraud, environmental offenses, false claims and statements, illegal payments to governmental officials (giving or receiving), unfair trade practices, and workplace-related offenses (e.g., unsafe working conditions). Variables included whether or not offices handled criminal or civil cases in the above categories, estimated number of cases in each category, and what types of criminal or civil sanctions were imposed on white-collar offenders. Researchers also assessed collaboration with partners outside of state attorneys offices, whether cases were referred for federal or local prosecution, and what circumstances lead to referring cases to state regulatory agencies. The extent to which state attorneys offices maintain white-collar crime data was also recorded.",

Under this design, several forecast models are used to make alternative forecasts in parallel. For each forecast model included in an experiment, the researchers estimated models on training data, forecasted one month ahead to new data not previously seen by the model, and calculated and saved the forecast error. Then they added the observed value of the previously forecasted data point to the next month's training data, dropped the oldest historical data point, and forecasted the following month's data point.

-            "description": "This study examined the effects of comprehensive registration and community notification policies on rates of sexual violence in South Carolina. Specifically, it proposed to (1) evaluate whether broad sex offender registration and notification policies have reduced recidivism or deterred new sexual offenses, (2) examine whether unintended effects of broad registration and notification policies occurred, and (3) focus on the effects of registration and notification as it pertained to offenses committed by adults.\r\nThe study examined whether the introduction of sex offender registration and notification laws in South Carolina were associated with reductions in sexual crimes and, if so, whether this reduction could be attributed to an actual reduction in sexual violence and/or recidivism (i.e., an intended effect) or to changes in criminal judicial processing of individuals for registry crimes (i.e., an unintended effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific study aims included examining whether: (1) South Carolina registration and notification policies had the intended effect of preventing first time sexual offending; (2) South Carolina registration and notification policies had the intended effect of reducing sexual recidivism for known sex offenders; and (3) South Carolina registration and notification policies had the unintended effect of reducing the probability that individuals who committed sexual crimes would be prosecuted or convicted for such crimes. In addition to these primary aims, the researchers also investigated (4) registration violations (e.g., failure to register) were associated with sexual or general recidivism.\r\n",

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed. \r\nThis study was a secondary analysis of data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)  and National Incidents Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for the period 1998-2007. The analysis calculates two separate measures of the incidents of violence that occurred during burglaries. The study addressed the following research questions:\r\nIs burglary a violent crime? \r\nAre different levels of violence associated with residential versus nonresidential burglaries? \r\nHow frequently is a household member present during a residential burglary?\r\nHow frequently does violence occur in the commission of a burglary?\r\nWhat forms does burglary-related violence take? \r\nAre there differences in rates of violence between attempted and completed burglaries?\r\nWhat constitutes the crime of burglary in current statutory law?\r\n How do the federal government and the various states define burglary (grades and elements)?\r\n Does statutory law comport with empirical observations of what the typical characteristics of acts of burglary are? \r\nThe SPSS code distributed here alters an existing dataset drawn from pre-existing studies. In order to use this code users must first create the original data file drawn from National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and National Incidents Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data from the period of 1998-2007. All data used for this study are publicly available through ICPSR. See the variable description section for a comprehensive list of, and direct links to, all datasets used to create this original dataset. ",

Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed. \r\nThis study was a secondary analysis of data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)  and National Incidents Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for the period 1998-2007. The analysis calculates two separate measures of the incidents of violence that occurred during burglaries. The study addressed the following research questions:\r\nIs burglary a violent crime? \r\nAre different levels of violence associated with residential versus nonresidential burglaries? \r\nHow frequently is a household member present during a residential burglary?\r\nHow frequently does violence occur in the commission of a burglary?\r\nWhat forms does burglary-related violence take? \r\nAre there differences in rates of violence between attempted and completed burglaries?\r\nWhat constitutes the crime of burglary in current statutory law?\r\n How do the federal government and the various states define burglary (grades and elements)?\r\n Does statutory law comport with empirical observations of what the typical characteristics of acts of burglary are? \r\nThe SPSS code distributed here alters an existing dataset drawn from pre-existing studies. In order to use this code users must first create the original data file drawn from National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and National Incidents Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data from the period of 1998-2007. All data used for this study are publicly available through ICPSR. See the variable description section for a comprehensive list of, and direct links to, all datasets used to create this original dataset. ",

Using geographic information systems (GIS) software, the researchers geocoded the addresses of the incident location, the victim's residence, and offender's residence for each homicide case. They then calculated both Euclidean distance and shortest path distance along the streets between each address per case. Upon applying the concept of triad as developed by Block et al.

The researchers then classified each triad according to two separate mobility triangle classification schemes: Traditional Mobility, based on shared or disparate social areas, and Distance Mobility, based on relative distance categories between locations.

The evaluation had both outcome and process components. \r\nThe outcome evaluation assessed the program's impact on shootings and killings in selected CeaseFire sites. Two types of crime data were compiled by the research team: Time Series Data (Dataset 1) and Shooting Incident Data (Dataset 2). Dataset 1 is comprised of aggregate month/year data on all shooting, gun murder, and persons shot incidents reported to Chicago police for CeaseFire's target beats and matched sets of comparison beats between January 1991 and December 2006, resulting in 1,332 observations. Dataset 2 consists of data on 4,828 shootings that were reported in CeaseFire's targeted police beats and in a matched set of comparison beats for two-year periods before and after the implementation of the program (February 1998 to April 2006). \r\nThe process evaluation involved assessing the program's operations and effectiveness. Researchers surveyed three groups of CeaseFire program stakeholders: employees, representatives of collaborating organizations, and clients. \r\nThe three sets of employee survey data examine such topics as their level of involvement with clients and CeaseFire activities, their assessments of their clients' problems, and their satisfaction with training and management practices. A total of 154 employees were surveyed: 23 outreach supervisors (Dataset 3), 78 outreach workers (Dataset 4), and 53 violence interrupters (Dataset 5). \r\nThe six sets of collaborating organization representatives data examine such topics as their level of familiarity and contact with the CeaseFire program, their opinions of CeaseFire clients, and their assessments of the costs and benefits of being involved with CeaseFire. A total of 230 representatives were surveyed: 20 business representatives (Dataset 6), 45 clergy representatives (Dataset 7), 26 community representatives (Dataset 8), 35 police representatives (Dataset 9), 36 school representatives (Dataset 10), and 68 service organization representatives (Dataset 11). \r\nThe Client Survey Data (Dataset 12) examine such topics as clients' involvement in the CeaseFire program, their satisfaction with aspects of life, and their opinions regarding the role of guns in neighborhood life. A total of 297 clients were interviewed. ",

The evaluation had both outcome and process components. \r\nThe outcome evaluation assessed the program's impact on shootings and killings in selected CeaseFire sites. Two types of crime data were compiled by the research team: Time Series Data (Dataset 1) and Shooting Incident Data (Dataset 2). Dataset 1 is comprised of aggregate month/year data on all shooting, gun murder, and persons shot incidents reported to Chicago police for CeaseFire's target beats and matched sets of comparison beats between January 1991 and December 2006, resulting in 1,332 observations. Dataset 2 consists of data on 4,828 shootings that were reported in CeaseFire's targeted police beats and in a matched set of comparison beats for two-year periods before and after the implementation of the program (February 1998 to April 2006). \r\nThe process evaluation involved assessing the program's operations and effectiveness. Researchers surveyed three groups of CeaseFire program stakeholders: employees, representatives of collaborating organizations, and clients. \r\nThe three sets of employee survey data examine such topics as their level of involvement with clients and CeaseFire activities, their assessments of their clients' problems, and their satisfaction with training and management practices. A total of 154 employees were surveyed: 23 outreach supervisors (Dataset 3), 78 outreach workers (Dataset 4), and 53 violence interrupters (Dataset 5). \r\nThe six sets of collaborating organization representatives data examine such topics as their level of familiarity and contact with the CeaseFire program, their opinions of CeaseFire clients, and their assessments of the costs and benefits of being involved with CeaseFire. A total of 230 representatives were surveyed: 20 business representatives (Dataset 6), 45 clergy representatives (Dataset 7), 26 community representatives (Dataset 8), 35 police representatives (Dataset 9), 36 school representatives (Dataset 10), and 68 service organization representatives (Dataset 11). \r\nThe Client Survey Data (Dataset 12) examine such topics as clients' involvement in the CeaseFire program, their satisfaction with aspects of life, and their opinions regarding the role of guns in neighborhood life. A total of 297 clients were interviewed. ",

A cross-sectional study of 93 people with mild or moderate dementia (aged 55 and older) and a comparison group of 50 older adults was conducted. Memories of recent autobiographical events that had both positive and negative emotional content were elicited during a structured interview, designed for consistency with accepted forensic interviewing techniques.  Accurate recollection of these events was independently verified by a non-demented informant, usually a family member. In addition, both members of the dyad were interviewed independently to assess other characteristics of people with dementia (PwD): demographics, depressive symptoms, functional and cognitive abilities, medications, health conditions, behaviors and characteristics of the dyadic relationship. Researchers also assessed PwD for disease stage, awareness of cognitive impairment, and episodic memory. A validated test of emotionally-influenced memory was administered to qualified participants to verify the novel structured interviewing assessment developed for this study. Two researchers conducted the study assessments during home visits.  The data file contains 945 cases and 732 variables.",

A cross-sectional study of 93 people with mild or moderate dementia (aged 55 and older) and a comparison group of 50 older adults was conducted. Memories of recent autobiographical events that had both positive and negative emotional content were elicited during a structured interview, designed for consistency with accepted forensic interviewing techniques.  Accurate recollection of these events was independently verified by a non-demented informant, usually a family member. In addition, both members of the dyad were interviewed independently to assess other characteristics of people with dementia (PwD): demographics, depressive symptoms, functional and cognitive abilities, medications, health conditions, behaviors and characteristics of the dyadic relationship. Researchers also assessed PwD for disease stage, awareness of cognitive impairment, and episodic memory. A validated test of emotionally-influenced memory was administered to qualified participants to verify the novel structured interviewing assessment developed for this study. Two researchers conducted the study assessments during home visits.  The data file contains 945 cases and 732 variables.",

Researchers administered a survey of beliefs, practices, background, and training experiences to custody evaluators. For comparison purposes, judges, legal aid attorneys, private attorneys, and domestic violence program workers were also surveyed.  Additionally, researchers used in-depth qualitative interviews of domestic abuse survivors to help interpret quantitative findings, to understand the complexities of their experiences, and to generate hypotheses for future research. The study had two major parts. Part 1 (Custody Evaluator Beliefs Dataset) was a survey of professionals, who had experience with custody cases (child custody evaluators, judges, attorneys, and domestic violence program workers). The dataset includes 1,246 cases and 162 variables. Part 2 (Qualitative Transcripts of Survivors' Interviews) involved qualitative, semi-structured interviews with domestic abuse survivors who experienced negative outcomes in family court.

Researchers administered a survey of beliefs, practices, background, and training experiences to custody evaluators. For comparison purposes, judges, legal aid attorneys, private attorneys, and domestic violence program workers were also surveyed.  Additionally, researchers used in-depth qualitative interviews of domestic abuse survivors to help interpret quantitative findings, to understand the complexities of their experiences, and to generate hypotheses for future research. The study had two major parts. Part 1 (Custody Evaluator Beliefs Dataset) was a survey of professionals, who had experience with custody cases (child custody evaluators, judges, attorneys, and domestic violence program workers). The dataset includes 1,246 cases and 162 variables. Part 2 (Qualitative Transcripts of Survivors' Interviews) involved qualitative, semi-structured interviews with domestic abuse survivors who experienced negative outcomes in family court. Part 2 contains interviews with 24 with domestic abuse survivors.",

Through this method, the researchers not only gained a sense of how local authorities handled these types of cases but also the ways in which trafficking victims \"fall through the cracks\" in the interfaces between local and federal judicial systems as well as among local, state, and federal law enforcement and social service systems.\r\n",

Specifically, the evaluation focused on the effectiveness of the LAP at decreasing the rates of repeat, lethal and near lethal violence and increasing the rates of emergency safety planning and help seeking among women who experienced IPV and called the police. Additionally, the predictive and concurrent validity of the screening portion of the LAP was evaluated, as were the implementation of the LAP by officers and IPV victims' satisfaction with the police responses they experienced.\r\nThe study consisted of two groups: (1) a comparison group, which included women who were victims of IPV and were referred to the study by a police officer; and (2) an intervention group which consisted of victims of IPV who were administered the LAP by police. Both groups were contacted for baseline and follow-up phone interview surveys that recorded the victims' self-reported demographic information (age, race, income, education marital status), information about the status of their relationships with their partners, as well as the type of abuse they had endured and how this affected their behavior.",

Specifically, the evaluation focused on the effectiveness of the LAP at decreasing the rates of repeat, lethal and near lethal violence and increasing the rates of emergency safety planning and help seeking among women who experienced IPV and called the police. Additionally, the predictive and concurrent validity of the screening portion of the LAP was evaluated, as were the implementation of the LAP by officers and IPV victims' satisfaction with the police responses they experienced.\r\nThe study consisted of two groups: (1) a comparison group, which included women who were victims of IPV and were referred to the study by a police officer; and (2) an intervention group which consisted of victims of IPV who were administered the LAP by police. Both groups were contacted for baseline and follow-up phone interview surveys that recorded the victims' self-reported demographic information (age, race, income, education marital status), information about the status of their relationships with their partners, as well as the type of abuse they had endured and how this affected their behavior.",

The project used Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) to identify commercial sexually exploited children (CSEC) in New York City. Interviews were conducted with 230 youths between January 2006 and December 2007. Quantitative surveys regarding the frequency and quality of cross-stakeholder communication were administered at the beginning of the evaluation and one year later. For the purpose of trend analysis of CSEC related offenses, research staff obtained citywide arrest and prosecution data on child prostitution, exploitation, and solicitation of a minor. The New York City Criminal Justice Agency (CJA) provided arrest data for arrestees under 19 years of age in all five boroughs of New York City from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2006.",

The study was divided into four sub-projects. First, a systematic review or \"meta-synthesis\" was conducted to identify effective elements of prevention identified by the research across different youth problem areas such as drug abuse, sex education, smoking prevention, suicide, youth violence, and school failure. The process resulted in the development of a KEEP (Known Elements of Effective Prevention) Checklist. Second, a content analysis was conducted on four of the most well-developed and long-standing youth internet safety curricula: i-SAFE, iKeepSafe, Netsmartz, and Web Wise Kids. Third, a process evaluation was conducted to better understand how internet safety education programs are being implemented. The process evaluation was conducted via national surveys with three different groups of respondents: Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force commanders (N=43), ICAC Task Force presenters (N=91), and a sample of school professionals (N=139). Finally, researchers developed an internet safety education outcome survey focused on online harassment and digital citizenship. The intention for creating and piloting this survey was to provide the field with a research-based tool that can be used in future evaluation and program monitoring efforts.",

The study was divided into four sub-projects. First, a systematic review or \"meta-synthesis\" was conducted to identify effective elements of prevention identified by the research across different youth problem areas such as drug abuse, sex education, smoking prevention, suicide, youth violence, and school failure. The process resulted in the development of a KEEP (Known Elements of Effective Prevention) Checklist. Second, a content analysis was conducted on four of the most well-developed and long-standing youth internet safety curricula: i-SAFE, iKeepSafe, Netsmartz, and Web Wise Kids. Third, a process evaluation was conducted to better understand how internet safety education programs are being implemented. The process evaluation was conducted via national surveys with three different groups of respondents: Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force commanders (N=43), ICAC Task Force presenters (N=91), and a sample of school professionals (N=139). Finally, researchers developed an internet safety education outcome survey focused on online harassment and digital citizenship. The intention for creating and piloting this survey was to provide the field with a research-based tool that can be used in future evaluation and program monitoring efforts.",

Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of intensive judicial monitoring on offender compliance with court orders and perpetration of future violence. Offenders were processed in either of two specialized domestic violence courts based in Rochester, New York between October 2006 and December 2009. Study-eligible defendants had to be either (1) convicted and sentenced to a conditional discharge or probation or (2) disposed with an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. Eligible defendants also had to be ordered to participate in a program (e.g., batterer program, substance abuse treatment). Once an eligible plea/disposition was entered, court staff randomly assigned defendants to either Group 1 (monitoring plus program, n = 77) or Group 2 (program only/no monitoring, n = 70). All of the offenders included in the sample were male. Offender interviews (n = 39) were completed between March 2008 and July 2010. The research intern present in court for compliance calendars approached offenders assigned to one of the two study groups to ask them to participate in the research interview on their last court appearance on the instant case (i.e., at successful dismissal from on-going monitoring or at re-sentencing). Victim interviews (n = 10) were conducted six months and one year post-offender disposition. Victims were contacted by staff from Alternatives for Battered Women (ABW), a local victim advocacy agency that was already in contact with many of the women coming through the domestic violence court.

Coders then determined whether the defendants were prosecuted for the charges brought against them (Differential Sentencing Data - Offenses, n=6,649). Offenses that were not prosecuted were differentiated from offenses that were prosecuted. Each charge was classified as domestic violence or non-domestic violence as defined by state statute.",

Phase I focused on testing methods and measures in 29 agencies in order to build the Platform infrastructure. First, a \"total department\" online methodology was successfully implemented covering numerous dimensions of organizational behavior, from supervision and accountability to employee integrity and burnout. Second, a public satisfaction contact survey was implemented in several jurisdictions to provide local external indicators of the quality of police-citizen encounters and organizational legitimacy in the community. Third, two longitudinal studies were initiated - one of new police recruits and one of new first-line supervisors - to chart their career development and identify factors that influence life trajectories. Finally, a randomized control trial was introduced in once site to test the effects of procedural justice training as part of the Platform's measurement system.",

Users should refer to the accompany readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collections and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.The National Police Research Platform was designed to a) strengthen the science of policing by generating timely, in-depth, longitudinal information about policing organizations, personnel and practices and, b) move policing in the direction of evidence-based \"learning organizations\" by providing translational feedback to police agencies and policy makers. Phase I focused on testing methods and measures in 29 agencies in order to build the Platform infrastructure. First, a \"total department\" online methodology was successfully implemented covering numerous dimensions of organizational behavior, from supervision and accountability to employee integrity and burnout. Second, a public satisfaction contact survey was implemented in several jurisdictions to provide local external indicators of the quality of police-citizen encounters and organizational legitimacy in the community. Third, two longitudinal studies were initiated - one of new police recruits and one of new first-line supervisors - to chart their career development and identify factors that influence life trajectories. Finally, a randomized control trial was introduced in once site to test the effects of procedural justice training as part of the Platform's measurement system.",

The study focuses on HGROs who were released from prison and placed on parole supervision with GPS monitoring in six California jurisdictions between March 2006 and October 2009. A propensity score procedure was performed using a sample of offenders drawn from the same six communities who were not placed on GPS monitoring. The matching procedure resulted in a final sample of 784 subjects (392 treatment and 392 control). The study used six primary sources to collect data: 1)the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) data management system, 2) official arrest records, 3) parole supervision records, 4) GPS monitoring data, 5) a CDCR parole agent (PA) survey, and 6) CDCR cost information.",

The study focuses on HGROs who were released from prison and placed on parole supervision with GPS monitoring in six California jurisdictions between March 2006 and October 2009. A propensity score procedure was performed using a sample of offenders drawn from the same six communities who were not placed on GPS monitoring. The matching procedure resulted in a final sample of 784 subjects (392 treatment and 392 control). The study used six primary sources to collect data: 1)the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) data management system, 2) official arrest records, 3) parole supervision records, 4) GPS monitoring data, 5) a CDCR parole agent (PA) survey, and 6) CDCR cost information.",

The G.R.E.A.T., a 13-lesson general prevention program taught by uniformed law enforcement\r\nofficers to middle school students, had three stated goals: 1) to reduce gang membership, 2) to reduce delinquency, especially violent offending, and 3) to\r\nimprove students' attitudes toward the police.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo assess program effectiveness, researchers conducted a randomized control trial involving 3,820 students nested in 195 classrooms in 31 schools in 7 cities.  A process evaluation consisted of multiple methods to assess program fidelity: 1) observations of G.R.E.A.T. Officer Trainings, 2) surveys and interviews of G.R.E.A.T.-trained officers and supervisors, 3) surveys of school personnel, and 4) \"on-site,\" direct observations of officers delivering the G.R.E.A.T. program  in the study sites.  Only the data from the student surveys, law enforcement officer surveys, and school personnel surveys are available.\r\n\r\n\r\nData file 1 (Student Survey Data) has 3,820 cases and 1,926 variables. Data file 2 (Law Enforcement Survey Data) has 137 cases and 140 variables. Data file 3 (School Personnel Survey Data) has 230 cases and 148 variables.\r\n",

The G.R.E.A.T., a 13-lesson general prevention program taught by uniformed law enforcement\r\nofficers to middle school students, had three stated goals: 1) to reduce gang membership, 2) to reduce delinquency, especially violent offending, and 3) to\r\nimprove students' attitudes toward the police.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo assess program effectiveness, researchers conducted a randomized control trial involving 3,820 students nested in 195 classrooms in 31 schools in 7 cities.  A process evaluation consisted of multiple methods to assess program fidelity: 1) observations of G.R.E.A.T. Officer Trainings, 2) surveys and interviews of G.R.E.A.T.-trained officers and supervisors, 3) surveys of school personnel, and 4) \"on-site,\" direct observations of officers delivering the G.R.E.A.T. program  in the study sites.  Only the data from the student surveys, law enforcement officer surveys, and school personnel surveys are available.\r\n\r\n\r\nData file 1 (Student Survey Data) has 3,820 cases and 1,926 variables. Data file 2 (Law Enforcement Survey Data) has 137 cases and 140 variables. Data file 3 (School Personnel Survey Data) has 230 cases and 148 variables.\r\n",

Using census tracts to approximate neighborhoods, the study regressed 2009 neighborhood robbery and burglary rates on foreclosure rates measured for 2007-2008 (a period during which foreclosure spiked dramatically in the nation), while accounting for 2007 robbery and burglary rates and other control variables that captured differences in social, economic, and demographic context across American neighborhoods and cities for this period. The analysis was based on more than 7,200 census tracts in over 60 large cities spread across 29 states. Core research questions were addressed with a series of multivariate multilevel and single-level regression models that accounted for the skewed nature of neighborhood crime patterns and the well-documented spatial dependence of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study contains one data file with 8,198 cases and 99 variables.\r\n",

Using census tracts to approximate neighborhoods, the study regressed 2009 neighborhood robbery and burglary rates on foreclosure rates measured for 2007-2008 (a period during which foreclosure spiked dramatically in the nation), while accounting for 2007 robbery and burglary rates and other control variables that captured differences in social, economic, and demographic context across American neighborhoods and cities for this period. The analysis was based on more than 7,200 census tracts in over 60 large cities spread across 29 states. Core research questions were addressed with a series of multivariate multilevel and single-level regression models that accounted for the skewed nature of neighborhood crime patterns and the well-documented spatial dependence of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study contains one data file with 8,198 cases and 99 variables.\r\n",

This project was designed as both a randomized and\r\n quasi-experimental field study to assess the effectiveness of work\r\n release in the Seattle area. It evaluated the impact of work release\r\n sentencing on recidivism and on corrections costs by comparing a\r\n sample of inmates who participated in work release with a comparable\r\n sample of inmates who completed their sentences in prison.

(2) What types of services are received\r\n by offenders in work release? and (3) How does the community\r\n experience of work release participants compare to that of similar\r\n offenders discharged directly into the Seattle community without\r\n having gone through work release? For each offender, detailed\r\n information was collected on measures relating to work release\r\n participation and recidivism outcomes. Information was gathered from\r\n Department of Corrections institutional files, work release program\r\n records, computerized payment information for legal and financial\r\n obligations, and statewide criminal history records.

Part 4, Prison Data,\r\n includes the number of days spent at different institutions and\r\n prerelease centers, work assignment, and prison infractions. Part 5,\r\n Work Release Data, contains information on the number of days spent at\r\n different work release facilities and any time spent in jail or on\r\n escape status while in work release. Data in this file also cover\r\n contacts and services received during work release, including personal\r\n and phone contacts between the work release participant and community\r\n corrections officer at the job and other sites, monitoring checks\r\n (employment verification, criminal records checks), sessions in\r\n outpatient counseling (drug, alcohol, family, other), employment\r\n (number of attempted and completed job interviews, primary job\r\n classification, length of employment, wages, and reason left), drug\r\n testing (date and type of test, type of positives, sanction imposed),\r\n infractions during work release and their sanctions, and arrests and\r\n their sanctions. Part 6, Community Placement Data, provides variables\r\n on the number of days each month that the offender was on the street,\r\n in work release, in pretrial detention, or in other custody, while\r\n Part 7, Post-Release Data, focuses on the number of days each month\r\n that the offender was on the street, in pretrial detention, or in\r\n prison or jail after being released from the work release\r\n program. Variables in Part 8, Infractions Data, pertain to the number\r\n and types of infractions and associated sanctions.

The task force incorporated an intensive supervision approach\r\nthat enforced conditions of probation and drug laws and provided\r\nvertical prosecution for probation violations and new offenses\r\ninvolving targeted offenders. This research project sought to address\r\nthe following research objectives: (1) to determine if the JUDGE\r\nprogram objectives were met during the grant period, (2) to assess the\r\nresults of program activities, such as surveillance, special\r\nenforcement, and vertical prosecution, in terms of probation\r\nviolations, arrests, pretrial custody, probation revocations,\r\nconvictions, and sentences, (3) to evaluate the impact of the program\r\non offenders as measured by recidivism and the need for probation\r\nintervention, (4) to assess the cost of JUDGE probation compared to\r\nregular probation caseloads, and (5) to provide recommendations\r\nregarding the implementation of similar programs in other\r\njurisdictions. This research project consisted of a process\r\nevaluation and an impact assessment that focused on the first two\r\nyears of the JUDGE program, when youthful offenders were the targets\r\n(1988 and 1989). The research effort focused only on new targets for\r\nwhom adequate records were maintained, yielding a study size of\r\n279. The tracking period for targets ended in 1992. For the impact\r\nassessment, the research was structured as a within-subjects design,\r\nwith the comparison focusing on target youths two years before the\r\nimplementation of JUDGE and the same group two years after being\r\ntargeted by JUDGE. Data were compiled on the juveniles' age at target,\r\nrace, sex, gang affiliation, type of target (gang member, drug\r\nhistory, and/or ward), status when targeted, and referrals to other\r\nagencies. Variables providing data on criminal histories include age\r\nat first contact/arrest, instant offense and disposition, highest\r\ncharges for each subsequent arrest that resulted in probation\r\nsupervision, drug charges, highest conviction charges, probation\r\nconditions before selection date and after JUDGE target, number of\r\ncontacts by probation and JUDGE staff, number of violations for each\r\nprobation condition and action taken, and new offenses during\r\nprobation. For the process evaluation, case outcome data were compared\r\nto project objectives to measure compliance in terms of program\r\nimplementation and results. Variables include number of violations for\r\neach probation condition and action taken, and number of failed drug\r\ntests. The consequences of increased probation supervision, including\r\nrevocation, sentences, custody time, and use of vertical prosecution,\r\nwere addressed by comparing the processing of cases prior to the\r\nimplementation of JUDGE to case processing after JUDGE targeting.",

This evaluation of PIR was\r\nbased on a quasiexperimental design that compared program activities\r\nand outcomes for two matched groups of high-risk probationers\r\nreceiving different levels of service and supervision. The assessment\r\nincluded both a process evaluation to discover if expected service\r\nlevels were implemented as designed, and an impact evaluation to\r\nassess the effectiveness of drug treatment within an intensive\r\ncommunity supervision program. The experimental group included 209 PIR\r\nparticipants who received intensive community supervision and drug\r\ntreatment, and the control group consisted of 151 probationers who\r\nwere assigned to regular high-risk probation caseloads and who met the\r\nPIR screening criteria. The samples were selected from probationers\r\nentering community supervision from February to December 1991. The\r\nlength of the PIR program varied, but for purposes of analysis the\r\nminimum time in the program to represent the intervention period was\r\nset at eight months, including relapse prevention. A comparable period\r\nwas used for the control group. The subsequent six-month period was\r\nused to measure the effects of PIR and regular high-risk probation\r\nafter intervention. Intake interviews were conducted with a subsample\r\nof 96 probationers in PIR and 80 in the control group (Part 1). The\r\ninterviews were conducted within the first two weeks after\r\nintake. Follow-up interviews were conducted with these probationers\r\nafter they had completed eight months of PIR or regular high-risk\r\nprobation to measure experiences on probation and changes in behavior\r\nand attitudes (Part 2). Follow-up interviews were completed with 47\r\nprobationers from the experimental group in the PIR program and 35 in\r\nthe control group. The case tracking portion of the study involved the\r\nreview of probation, treatment, and state and local criminal history\r\nfiles (Part 3). Data on technical violations and arrests for new\r\ncrimes were compiled for the following time periods: (1) six months\r\nprior to the instant offense (the baseline), (2) the first eight\r\nmonths of community supervision (the in-program period), (3) the six\r\nmonths after intervention, and (4) the combined 14-month period. The\r\ninitial interview (Part 1) included questions regarding\r\nsociodemographic characteristics, current offense, awareness of\r\nprobation conditions ordered, perceived consequences for violations of\r\nprobation, drug use and drug history, prior drug treatment and\r\ntreatment needs, criminal history, expectations regarding the\r\nprobation term, opinions regarding probation and treatment, daily\r\nactivities prior to the current offense, current life satisfaction,\r\nand prospects for the future. Questions on the follow-up interview\r\n(Part 2) focused on changes in probationers' personal lives (e.g.,\r\nemployment, income, education, marital status, living situation, and\r\nrelationships with family and friends), technical probation violations\r\nand new offenses committed during the eight-month period, sanctions\r\nimposed by probation staff, contacts with probation and treatment\r\nstaff, changes in drug use and daily activities, expectations with\r\nregard to remaining crime- and drug-free in the future, attitudes\r\nregarding probation and treatment, treatment needs, and significant\r\nlife changes over the eight-month period. Variables in the tracking\r\ndata file (Part 3) include sociodemographic characteristics, current\r\noffense and sentence imposed, probation conditions ordered, drug use\r\nhistory, offense and probation violations occurring before, during,\r\nand after an eight-month probation period, custody time, changes in\r\nlevel of probation supervision, and program interventions such as drug\r\ntests, services delivered, and sanctions imposed.",

-            "description": "This study sought to evaluate how well day fines work as an\r\n intermediate sanction. Day fines are a structured approach to imposing\r\n fines that considers both the offender's ability to pay and the\r\n severity of the offense. The program involves two steps: (1) a\r\n determination of the number of fine units for an offense, based on the\r\n severity of the offense, and (2) a valuation of fine units, based on\r\n the offender's net daily income, hence the name \"day fines\". While\r\n four jurisdictions participated in the day fines evaluation, only the\r\n site in Maricopa County, Arizona, was structured in such a way to\r\n allow for a quasi-experimental research design. Therefore, this\r\n collection only contains data from the Financial Assessment Related to\r\n Employability (FARE) day fines program in Maricopa County. The FARE\r\n program was started in 1991 and targeted felony offenders with little\r\n need for supervision or treatment -- in other words, the low risk-low\r\n need defendant. The intent of the program was to draw clients from the\r\n population of offenders who would traditionally receive routine\r\n probation, thus serving as an intermediate sanction between routine\r\n and summary probation. The major research strategy was to consider the\r\n FARE-sentenced offenders as the experimental group and to construct a\r\n similar comparison group out of the offenders sentenced by non-day\r\n fines judges. The design involved three major steps: (1)\r\n identification of 1991 and 1992 defendants who received a FARE\r\n sentence, (2) screening of sentenced defendants in non-FARE courts\r\n using FARE eligibility criteria to match the FARE participants, and\r\n (3) coding background and 12-month follow-up information for both FARE\r\n and comparison group offenders from probation and clerk files to\r\n record background information, monetary payments, and any technical\r\n violations and arrests occurring during the 12-month follow-up\r\n period. Variables in Part 1, Fines Paid Data, include the total amount\r\n of the fine and how much of the fine was applied to probation fees,\r\n reimbursement, restitution, and victim compensation. Part 2, Official\r\n Records Data, contains background information such as arrest history,\r\n marital status, education, drug use, and drug treatment. Additional\r\n information includes current arrest, recommended sentence,\r\n disposition, sentence imposed, employment and income, and risk/needs\r\n assessment. Six- and 12-month reviews collected data on supervisory\r\n status, technical violations, new arrests, payment enforcement, and\r\npayment term revisions.",

The\r\nexperiment's objective was to compare the drug use and criminal\r\nbehavior of probationers assigned to four alternative regimes or\r\ntracks: (1) standard probation, but no drug testing, (2) standard\r\nprobation with random monthly drug tests, (3) standard probation with\r\ntesting scheduled twice a week, and (4) drug court, an integrated\r\nprogram of drug testing, treatment, and sanctions that utilized a\r\ncarefully structured set of rewards and punishments. The experiment\r\nwas limited to first-time felony offenders convicted of drug\r\npossession or use (not sales) and sentenced to a term of three years'\r\nprobation. A total of 630 probationers from Maricopa County were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of the four experimental regimes and tracked\r\nfor a 12-month period.

Background Data\r\n(Part 1) include demographic variables such as race, sex, education,\r\nmarital status, living arrangements, and employment history. In\r\naddition, there are variables on prior drug use and abuse, drug\r\ntreatment, criminal histories as both a juvenile and an adult, and\r\nrisk and need assessment scores. Other variables include the results\r\nof drug testing and any sanctions taken for a positive result (Part\r\n2), new arrests while on probation and corresponding disposition and\r\nconviction (Part 3), and technical violations and any actions taken\r\nfor these violations (Part 4).

At the macro level of analysis, this\r\nresearch examined the influences of sociocultural, crime, and school\r\ncharacteristics on aggregate-level school violence and academic\r\nperformance measures. Here the focus was on understanding community,\r\nfamily, and crime compositional effects on disruption and violence in\r\nPhiladelphia schools. This level included Census data and crime rates\r\nfor the Census tracts where the schools were located (local data), as\r\nwell as for the community of residence of the students (imported data)\r\nfor all 255 schools within the Philadelphia School District. The\r\nsecond level of analysis, the intermediate level, included all of the\r\nvariables measured at the macro level, and added school organizational\r\nstructure and school climate, measured with survey data, as mediating\r\nvariables. Part 1, Macro-Level Data, contains arrest and offense data\r\nand Census characteristics, such as race, poverty level, and household\r\nincome, for the Census tracts where each of the 255 Philadelphia\r\nschools is located and for the Census tracts where the students who\r\nattend those schools reside. In addition, this file contains school\r\ncharacteristics, such as number and race of students and teachers,\r\nstudent attendance, average exam scores, and number of suspensions for\r\nvarious reasons. For Part 2, Principal Interview Data, principals from\r\nall 42 middle schools in Philadelphia were interviewed on the number\r\nof buildings and classrooms in their school, square footage and\r\nspecial features of the school, and security measures. For Part 3,\r\nteachers were administered the Effective School Battery survey and\r\nasked about their job satisfaction, training opportunities,\r\nrelationships with principals and parents, participation in school\r\nactivities, safety measures, and fear of crime at school. In Part 4,\r\nstudents were administered the Effective School Battery survey and\r\nasked about their attachment to school, extracurricular activities,\r\nattitudes toward teachers and school, academic achievement, and fear\r\nof crime at school. Part 5, Student Victimization Data, asked the same\r\nstudents from Part 4 about their victimization experiences, the\r\navailability of drugs, and discipline measures at school. It also\r\nprovides self-reports of theft, assault, drug use, gang membership,\r\nand weapon possession at school.",

At the macro level of analysis, this\r\nresearch examined the influences of sociocultural, crime, and school\r\ncharacteristics on aggregate-level school violence and academic\r\nperformance measures. Here the focus was on understanding community,\r\nfamily, and crime compositional effects on disruption and violence in\r\nPhiladelphia schools. This level included Census data and crime rates\r\nfor the Census tracts where the schools were located (local data), as\r\nwell as for the community of residence of the students (imported data)\r\nfor all 255 schools within the Philadelphia School District. The\r\nsecond level of analysis, the intermediate level, included all of the\r\nvariables measured at the macro level, and added school organizational\r\nstructure and school climate, measured with survey data, as mediating\r\nvariables. Part 1, Macro-Level Data, contains arrest and offense data\r\nand Census characteristics, such as race, poverty level, and household\r\nincome, for the Census tracts where each of the 255 Philadelphia\r\nschools is located and for the Census tracts where the students who\r\nattend those schools reside. In addition, this file contains school\r\ncharacteristics, such as number and race of students and teachers,\r\nstudent attendance, average exam scores, and number of suspensions for\r\nvarious reasons. For Part 2, Principal Interview Data, principals from\r\nall 42 middle schools in Philadelphia were interviewed on the number\r\nof buildings and classrooms in their school, square footage and\r\nspecial features of the school, and security measures. For Part 3,\r\nteachers were administered the Effective School Battery survey and\r\nasked about their job satisfaction, training opportunities,\r\nrelationships with principals and parents, participation in school\r\nactivities, safety measures, and fear of crime at school. In Part 4,\r\nstudents were administered the Effective School Battery survey and\r\nasked about their attachment to school, extracurricular activities,\r\nattitudes toward teachers and school, academic achievement, and fear\r\nof crime at school. Part 5, Student Victimization Data, asked the same\r\nstudents from Part 4 about their victimization experiences, the\r\navailability of drugs, and discipline measures at school. It also\r\nprovides self-reports of theft, assault, drug use, gang membership,\r\nand weapon possession at school.",

-            "description": "This study of violent incidents among middle- and\r\nhigh-school students focused not only on the types and frequency of\r\nthese incidents, but also on their dynamics -- the locations, the\r\nopening moves, the relationship between the disputants, the goals and\r\njustifications of the aggressor, the role of third parties, and other\r\nfactors. For this study, violence was defined as an act carried out\r\nwith the intention, or perceived intention, of physically injuring\r\nanother person, and the \"opening move\" was defined as the action of\r\na respondent, antagonist, or third party that was viewed as beginning\r\nthe violent incident. Data were obtained from interviews with 70 boys\r\nand 40 girls who attended public schools with populations that had\r\nhigh rates of violence. About half of the students came from a middle\r\nschool in an economically disadvantaged African-American section of a\r\nlarge southern city. The neighborhood the school served, which\r\nincluded a public housing project, had some of the country's highest\r\nrates of reported violent crime. The other half of the sample were\r\nvolunteers from an alternative high school attended by students who\r\nhad committed serious violations of school rules, largely involving\r\nillegal drugs, possession of handguns, or fighting. Many students in\r\nthis high school, which is located in a large city in the southern\r\npart of the Midwest, came from high-crime areas, including public\r\nhousing communities. The interviews were open-ended, with the students\r\nencouraged to speak at length about any violent incidents in school,\r\nat home, or in the neighborhood in which they had been involved. The\r\n110 interviews yielded 250 incidents and are presented as text files,\r\nParts 3 and 4. The interview transcriptions were then reduced to a\r\nquantitative database with the incident as the unit of analysis\r\n(Part 1). Incidents were diagrammed, and events in each sequence were\r\ncoded and grouped to show the typical patterns and sub-patterns in\r\nthe interactions. Explanations the students offered for the\r\nviolent-incident behavior were grouped into two categories: (1)\r\n\"justifications,\" in which the young people accepted responsibility\r\nfor their violent actions but denied that the actions were wrong, and\r\n(2) \"excuses,\" in which the young people admitted the act was wrong\r\nbut denied responsibility. Every case in the incident database had at\r\nleast one physical indicator of force or violence. The\r\nrespondent-level file (Part 2) was created from the incident-level\r\nfile using the AGGREGATE procedure in SPSS. Variables in Part 1\r\ninclude the sex, grade, and age of the respondent, the sex and\r\nestimated age of the antagonist, the relationship between respondent\r\nand antagonist, the nature and location of the opening move, the\r\nrespondent's response to the opening move, persons present during the\r\nincident, the respondent's emotions during the incident, the person\r\nwho ended the fight, punishments imposed due to the incident, whether\r\nthe respondent was arrested, and the duration of the incident.\r\nAdditional items cover the number of times during the incident that\r\nsomething was thrown, the respondent was pushed, slapped, or spanked,\r\nwas kicked, bit, or hit with a fist or with something else, was beaten\r\nup, cut, or bruised, was threatened with a knife or gun, or a knife or\r\ngun was used on the respondent. Variables in Part 2 include the\r\nrespondent's age, gender, race, and grade at the time of the\r\ninterview, the number of incidents per respondent, if the respondent\r\nwas an armed robber or a victim of an armed robbery, and whether the\r\nrespondent had something thrown at him/her, was pushed, slapped, or\r\nspanked, was kicked, bit, or hit with a fist or with something else,\r\nwas beaten up, was threatened with a knife or gun, or had a knife or\r\ngun used on him/her.",

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive,\r\n case-level examination of the full spectrum of case processing of\r\n serious child abuse and neglect cases as they flowed through the\r\n justice process, from initial receipt of a report to final disposition\r\n in the criminal and/or civil court. This was accomplished by in-depth,\r\n detailed tracking, from a single jurisdiction, of both prospective and\r\n retrospective samples of serious child abuse cases reported to child\r\n protective services and law enforcement agencies. The four agencies\r\n that participated directly by providing case samples and case files\r\n for tracking were: (1) Child Protective Services (CPS), (2) the\r\n sheriff's office, (3) Dependency Court Legal Services (DCLS), and (4)\r\n the county prosecutor's office. Each case was abstracted at the point\r\n of sampling and then tracked throughout the other participating\r\n agencies. Data were collected over a nine-month period. Part 1,\r\n Maltreatment Abstract, Person Roster, and CPS Abstract Data, contains\r\n three types of data. First, information is provided on each\r\n maltreatment incident committed by each perpetrator, background of the\r\n perpetrator and the victim, and characteristics of the incident. The\r\n data continue with a roster of persons, which covers the relationships\r\n among the individuals in the case and whether any of these individuals\r\n were living together at the time of the maltreatment. Data from the\r\n CPS abstract include which source brought the case to the attention of\r\n Protective Services, the dates, priority, and investigation level of\r\n the report, if any prior allegations of maltreatment had occurred that\r\n involved either the same victims and/or perpetrators and, if so,\r\n information on those reports, and the perpetrator's response to the\r\n incident and level of cooperation with the investigation. For each\r\n victim, information is given on medical findings, if applicable,\r\n whether photographs were taken, whether a guardian was appointed,\r\n whether the victim was assigned an interim placement, and the CPS\r\n disposition of the case. Part 1 concludes with information on\r\n interviews with the victim, where the case was referred, the\r\n assessment of risk in the case, and whether the victim was placed in\r\n foster care. Part 2, Dependency Court Abstract Data, provides\r\n information on the case, the reason the case was closed, and the\r\n outcome as determined by the court. Part 3, Juvenile Court Schedule of\r\n Hearings Data, focuses on the schedule of hearings, such as who was\r\n present and if they were represented by an attorney, whether the\r\n hearing took place, and, if not, the reason for delay. Part 4, Law\r\n Enforcement Abstract Data, contains dates of incidents, reports, and\r\n arrests, details of the case, and how the case was handled. Part 5,\r\n State Attorney's Office Abstract Data, offers data on the case\r\n closing, charges, and sentencing, as well as information on the type\r\n of defense attorney representing the perpetrator, if a juvenile, how\r\n the defendant was referred to adult court, whether the state attorney\r\n filed cases on other perpetrators in the case, whether the victim was\r\n interviewed by the prosecutor prior to filing, and whether the victim\r\n was deposed by the state attorney after the case was filed. Part 6,\r\n Criminal Court Schedule of Hearings Data, contains information on date\r\n of arrest, filing, and court hearing, whether a public defender was\r\n assigned, number of hearings, type of hearing, and coded remarks about\r\n the hearing. Part 7, State Attorney Addendum Data, provides\r\n \"no-file\" data from the State Attorney Questionnaire Addendum,\r\n including if the no-file was a warrant or arrest, date of the no-file,\r\nand reason for the no-file.",

The CDVC was a specialized court that\r\ncombined the efforts of law enforcement, judges, prosecutors, mental\r\nhealth professionals, and victim advocates to improve the safety of\r\ndomestic violence victims and hold offenders accountable. The\r\nresearchers undertook to evaluate and measure the extent to which the\r\nCDVC was successful in implementing its goals. For the process\r\nevaluation, interviews were conducted in 2002 with 50 victims and 50\r\ndefendants to examine their overall level of satisfaction with the\r\ncourt process, their perceptions of procedural justice, and their\r\nrecommendations for improving the CDVC process. Interviews were\r\nconducted in person using structured questions immediately after a\r\ncase was heard. The outcome evaluation consisted of two methods of\r\ndata collection. A time series intervention analysis examined the\r\nmonthly frequency of criminal domestic violence for the years 1997\r\nthrough 2001. Criminal domestic violence cases were compared for the\r\n34 months before the establishment of the CDVC (January 1997 to\r\nOctober 1999) and the first 26 months following its implementation\r\n(November 1999 to December 2001). Additionally, in an effort to\r\nexamine the impact of the Lexington County Criminal Domestic Violence\r\nCourt on individual case outcomes, a recidivism analysis was conducted\r\non a random sample of 400 criminal domestic violence cases. Of these\r\ncases, 200 were control cases drawn from the Lexington County\r\nSheriff's Department's arrest database for the period January 1997 to\r\nJune 1999, and 200 were treatment cases comprised of domestic violence\r\narrest cases that occurred between December 1999 and December 2000 and\r\nprocessed through CDVC. Variables in Part 1 (Victim Interview Data)\r\nand Part 2 (Defendant Interview Data) included responses to structured\r\ninterview questions about the victims' and offenders' perceptions of\r\nvarious aspects of the court process, whether they felt treated with\r\ndignity and respect, and their overall impression of the CDVC response\r\nto domestic violence. Variables in Part 3 (Monthly Arrest Data)\r\ninclude court period, month, and frequency of monthly domestic\r\nviolence arrests, monthly simple assault arrests, and monthly\r\naggravated assault arrests. Variables in Part 4 (Recidivism Data)\r\ninclude race, age, and gender of offender, employment status, booking\r\ndate, days in jail prior to trial, number of charges pending, number\r\nof prior domestic violence offenses, date of first re-arrest,\r\nrecidivism within first year and a half, days free of arrest, if\r\ndefendant was diverted to pretrial intervention, and the amount of the\r\nfine.",

In order to describe how states implemented the\r\nJAIBG program, this study examined the program's effects on state and\r\nlocal juvenile justice policies and practices, which included studying\r\nhow states awarded the grant funds to localities and for what\r\npurposes, and an assessment of how states changed their policies and\r\npractices during this period. Variables in Part 1 (Juvenile\r\nAccountability Incentive Block Grant (JAIBG) Subgrant Follow-Up\r\nInformation Form Data) provide grant information, jurisdiction type,\r\nplanning typology of state, amount of funds budgeted for\r\nadministrative purposes, and for each of 12 purpose areas, total\r\namount of funds spent in subgrant, and number of the various entities\r\ninvolved in juvenile crime prevention. Variables in Part 2 (Fiscal\r\nYear 1998 Supplemental Programmatic Information Form Data) provide\r\ngrant information, jurisdiction type, planning typology of state, type\r\nof program, primary purpose of funded programs in each of the 12\r\npurpose areas (if the funds supported a new program in that purpose\r\narea), as well as allocation of funds and total funds in each purpose\r\narea. Variables in Parts 3-5 (Perceptions and Attitudes About the\r\nJAIBG Program Survey Data for JAIBG Subgrant Recipients, Perceptions\r\nand Attitudes About the JAIBG Program Survey Data for State Juvenile\r\nCrime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC) Members, and Perceptions and\r\nAttitudes About the JAIBG Program Survey Data for Local Juvenile Crime\r\nEnforcement Coalition (JCEC) Members) provide state, planning typology\r\nof state, and recipient's professional affiliations (by category). The\r\nsurveys also included questions to measure the recipient's\r\nsatisfaction with the JAIBG program and the funding received. Data\r\navailable in this collection were obtained from the following two\r\nsources: (1) data collected by Follow-Up Information Forms (FIFs) for\r\nfiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 (Part 1), and (2) mail survey data\r\ncollected by Abt Associates Inc., which included: programmatic and\r\nfinancial data for a sample of fiscal year 1998 programs (Part 2),\r\nattitudinal and opinion surveys of a sample of subgrant recipients\r\n(Part 3), state Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC) members\r\n(Part 4), and a sample of local JCEC members (Part 5).",

In order to describe how states implemented the\r\nJAIBG program, this study examined the program's effects on state and\r\nlocal juvenile justice policies and practices, which included studying\r\nhow states awarded the grant funds to localities and for what\r\npurposes, and an assessment of how states changed their policies and\r\npractices during this period. Variables in Part 1 (Juvenile\r\nAccountability Incentive Block Grant (JAIBG) Subgrant Follow-Up\r\nInformation Form Data) provide grant information, jurisdiction type,\r\nplanning typology of state, amount of funds budgeted for\r\nadministrative purposes, and for each of 12 purpose areas, total\r\namount of funds spent in subgrant, and number of the various entities\r\ninvolved in juvenile crime prevention. Variables in Part 2 (Fiscal\r\nYear 1998 Supplemental Programmatic Information Form Data) provide\r\ngrant information, jurisdiction type, planning typology of state, type\r\nof program, primary purpose of funded programs in each of the 12\r\npurpose areas (if the funds supported a new program in that purpose\r\narea), as well as allocation of funds and total funds in each purpose\r\narea. Variables in Parts 3-5 (Perceptions and Attitudes About the\r\nJAIBG Program Survey Data for JAIBG Subgrant Recipients, Perceptions\r\nand Attitudes About the JAIBG Program Survey Data for State Juvenile\r\nCrime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC) Members, and Perceptions and\r\nAttitudes About the JAIBG Program Survey Data for Local Juvenile Crime\r\nEnforcement Coalition (JCEC) Members) provide state, planning typology\r\nof state, and recipient's professional affiliations (by category). The\r\nsurveys also included questions to measure the recipient's\r\nsatisfaction with the JAIBG program and the funding received. Data\r\navailable in this collection were obtained from the following two\r\nsources: (1) data collected by Follow-Up Information Forms (FIFs) for\r\nfiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 (Part 1), and (2) mail survey data\r\ncollected by Abt Associates Inc., which included: programmatic and\r\nfinancial data for a sample of fiscal year 1998 programs (Part 2),\r\nattitudinal and opinion surveys of a sample of subgrant recipients\r\n(Part 3), state Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition (JCEC) members\r\n(Part 4), and a sample of local JCEC members (Part 5).",
