The first such study, NISMART-1 (NATIONAL INCIDENCE STUDIES OF\r\nMISSING, ABDUCTED, RUNAWAY, AND THROWNAWAY CHILDREN (NISMART), 1988\r\n[ICPSR 9682]), was conducted from 1988 to 1989 and addressed this\r\nmandate by defining major types of missing child episodes and\r\nestimating the number of children who experienced missing child\r\nepisodes of each type in 1988. At that time, the lack of a\r\nstandardized definition of a \"missing child\" made it impossible to\r\nprovide a single estimate of missing children. As a result, one of the\r\nprimary goals of NISMART-2 was to develop a standardized definition\r\nand provide unified estimates of the number of missing children in the\r\nUnited States. Both NISMART-1 and NISMART-2 comprise several component\r\ndatasets designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the population\r\nof children who experienced qualifying episodes, with each component\r\nfocusing on a different aspect of the missing child population. The\r\nHousehold Survey -- Youth Data and the Household Survey -- Adult Data\r\n(Parts 1-2) are similar but separate surveys, one administered to the\r\nadult primary caretaker of the children in the sampled household and\r\nthe other to a randomly selected household youth aged 10 through 18 at\r\nthe time of interview. The Juvenile Facilities Data on Runaways (Part\r\n3) sought to estimate the number of runaways from juvenile residential\r\nfacilities in order to supplement the household survey estimate of the\r\nnumber of runaways from households. And the Law Enforcement Study\r\nData, by case perpetrator, and victim, (Parts 4-6) intended to\r\nestimate the number of children who were victims of stereotypical\r\nkidnappings and to obtain a sample of these cases for in-depth study.",

The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 2003, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction.

In 2002, the JRFC used two modules to collect information on the substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathered important information about the youth the services were directed toward and how the services were provided. The census indicated the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examined prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility. Congress requires the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to report annually on the number of deaths of juveniles in custody; JRFC collected information on such deaths for the one-year period just prior to the census reference date.

CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 2006, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in February. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.",

The purpose of this research was to conduct a national analysis of federal prosecutions of CSEC-related cases from 1998 through 2005, in order to answer the following four research questions:\r\n\r\nIs the United States enforcing existing federal laws related to CSEC?\r\nWhat are key features of successfully prosecuted CSEC cases? What factors predict convictions in cases? What factors predict sentence length?\r\nHave the U.S. courts increased penalties associated with sexual crimes against children?\r\nWhat, if any, are the effects of CSEC legislation on service providers who work with these victims?\r\nThe data collection includes three datasets: (Dataset 1) Base Cohort File with 7,696 cases for 50 variables, (Dataset 2) Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Defendants in cases filed in U.S. Court with 7,696 cases for 100 variables, and (Dataset 3) Suspects in Criminal Matters Investigated and Concluded by U.S. Attorneys Dataset with 13,819 cases for 14 variables.",

The purpose of this research was to conduct a national analysis of federal prosecutions of CSEC-related cases from 1998 through 2005, in order to answer the following four research questions:\r\n\r\nIs the United States enforcing existing federal laws related to CSEC?\r\nWhat are key features of successfully prosecuted CSEC cases? What factors predict convictions in cases? What factors predict sentence length?\r\nHave the U.S. courts increased penalties associated with sexual crimes against children?\r\nWhat, if any, are the effects of CSEC legislation on service providers who work with these victims?\r\nThe data collection includes three datasets: (Dataset 1) Base Cohort File with 7,696 cases for 50 variables, (Dataset 2) Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) Defendants in cases filed in U.S. Court with 7,696 cases for 100 variables, and (Dataset 3) Suspects in Criminal Matters Investigated and Concluded by U.S. Attorneys Dataset with 13,819 cases for 14 variables.",

-            "description": "Although delinquency among adolescent girls is rising, little research exists on the long-term effects of prevention programs meant for them. This project is a long-term evaluation of a gender-specific program, the Young Women Leaders Program (YWLP), a one-on-one and group-based mentoring program, in preventing delinquency and related outcomes in girls at-risk for delinquency. The primary research questions included:\r\n1) Is YWLP effective long-term in preventing or reducing delinquency and associated risk outcomes in at-risk adolescent girls?\r\n2) What do mentees and mentors identify as key mentoring and relationship processes related to effective mentoring?\r\n3) Do key mentoring and relationship processes moderate the effects of the mentoring intervention in preventing or reducing girls' delinquency and associated risk outcomes during high school?\r\nResearchers collected five-year follow-up surveys from girls who participated in an evaluation of YWLP from 2007-2010. The sample includes two cohorts of girls (2008-09 and 2009-10) who were randomly assigned to participate in YWLP or in a control group during their seventh grade year, as well as a third cohort (2007-2008) of non-randomized program and control girls used to pilot test recruitment strategies and measures, and to boost the sample size for analyses. In the original study, girls were nominated at the end of sixth grade because of individual or demographic characteristics related to delinquency risk and were assigned to YWLP or a control group condition; they completed one pre- and two post-assessments during seventh grade. The research team followed up with the girls five years later and administered surveys focused on key academic, social, emotional, and behavioral indicators.\r\nA secondary goal is to assess the role of mentoring processes and relationship quality in explaining girls' long-term outcomes. The research team interviewed a subset of girls and their mentors who were identified as having the highest and lowest quality mentoring relationships during the program (based on their scores on a relational quality scale from the original study). The interview data explores what girls and mentors remember about their mentoring relationships five years later, how they think the program affected them, if at all, and what aspects of the relationships they recalled as helping or hindering the relationship.\r\nData in this release contain two parts: DS1--survey data and DS2--interview transcripts.",

This project is a long-term evaluation of a gender-specific program, the Young Women Leaders Program (YWLP), a one-on-one and group-based mentoring program, in preventing delinquency and related outcomes in girls at-risk for delinquency. The primary research questions included:\r\n1) Is YWLP effective long-term in preventing or reducing delinquency and associated risk outcomes in at-risk adolescent girls?\r\n2) What do mentees and mentors identify as key mentoring and relationship processes related to effective mentoring?\r\n3) Do key mentoring and relationship processes moderate the effects of the mentoring intervention in preventing or reducing girls' delinquency and associated risk outcomes during high school?\r\nResearchers collected five-year follow-up surveys from girls who participated in an evaluation of YWLP from 2007-2010. The sample includes two cohorts of girls (2008-09 and 2009-10) who were randomly assigned to participate in YWLP or in a control group during their seventh grade year, as well as a third cohort (2007-2008) of non-randomized program and control girls used to pilot test recruitment strategies and measures, and to boost the sample size for analyses. In the original study, girls were nominated at the end of sixth grade because of individual or demographic characteristics related to delinquency risk and were assigned to YWLP or a control group condition; they completed one pre- and two post-assessments during seventh grade. The research team followed up with the girls five years later and administered surveys focused on key academic, social, emotional, and behavioral indicators.\r\nA secondary goal is to assess the role of mentoring processes and relationship quality in explaining girls' long-term outcomes. The research team interviewed a subset of girls and their mentors who were identified as having the highest and lowest quality mentoring relationships during the program (based on their scores on a relational quality scale from the original study). The interview data explores what girls and mentors remember about their mentoring relationships five years later, how they think the program affected them, if at all, and what aspects of the relationships they recalled as helping or hindering the relationship.\r\nData in this release contain two parts: DS1--survey data and DS2--interview transcripts.",

A systematic search identified 29 publications that met the eligibility criteria and represented 30 treatment-comparison contrasts. Of these studies, 6 evaluated the effectiveness of trauma-informed programs for justice-involved youth, and the remaining 24 evaluated programs for at-risk children and youth. From these studies, researchers extracted results related to delinquency, problem behaviors, aggression, antisocial behavior, substance use, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes. Most of these studies (24) used random assignment to conditions designs, with the remaining 6 using a quasi experimental design with a comparison condition.\r\nVariables in this collection include type of publication, authors, country of study, type of primary study design, publication year, youth type (at-risk or delinquent), frequency and duration of treatment, treatment techniques and types of therapy, treatment and control group sample sizes, as well as variables summarizing respondent histories of abuse, neglect, trauma, violence, delinquency, institutionalization, homelessness, and involvement in foster care. Demographic information on primary study respondents includes overall sample, treatment, and control group percentage breakdowns by ethnicity and respondent age summary statistics.\r\n",

A systematic search identified 29 publications that met the eligibility criteria and represented 30 treatment-comparison contrasts. Of these studies, 6 evaluated the effectiveness of trauma-informed programs for justice-involved youth, and the remaining 24 evaluated programs for at-risk children and youth. From these studies, researchers extracted results related to delinquency, problem behaviors, aggression, antisocial behavior, substance use, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) outcomes. Most of these studies (24) used random assignment to conditions designs, with the remaining 6 using a quasi experimental design with a comparison condition.\r\nVariables in this collection include type of publication, authors, country of study, type of primary study design, publication year, youth type (at-risk or delinquent), frequency and duration of treatment, treatment techniques and types of therapy, treatment and control group sample sizes, as well as variables summarizing respondent histories of abuse, neglect, trauma, violence, delinquency, institutionalization, homelessness, and involvement in foster care. Demographic information on primary study respondents includes overall sample, treatment, and control group percentage breakdowns by ethnicity and respondent age summary statistics.\r\n",

The purpose of this study was to assess AIM's implementation and outcomes.

-            "description": "A major goal of juvenile justice reform is to reduce reoffending and recidivism among juvenile offenders. Advocates of trauma informed practices assert that disproportionately high rates of violence exposure and trauma symptoms exacerbate the delinquent and violent behavior of juvenile offenders, but there is little evidence of the role of trauma in reoffending, particularly for the group of juvenile offenders that are at the highest risk for reoffending: serious offenders. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct secondary data analysis on data from the Pathways to Desistance Study (Mulvey et al., 2004) to enhance understanding of how continuous trauma exposure and related symptoms impact reoffending in serious juvenile offenders. This study utilized secondary data analysis on six annual waves of data from the Pathways to Desistance study (Mulvey et al., 2004), a large multi-site, longitudinal study of adolescents who had committed a serious criminal offense.\r\nThe study followed juvenile offenders into adulthood. The current study analyzed youth self-report of demographic variables, community violence exposure, trauma-related symptoms, and violent offending, as well as official records of youth offending. Regression analysis, latent transition analysis, and survival analysis were used to examine the research questions and hypotheses.\r\nResults showed that the majority of participants experienced continuous violence exposure as witnesses to community violence, with lower rates for\r\nvictimization. Further, violence exposure and trauma-related symptoms (anxiety and hostility) co-occurred over time. Also, continuous violence exposure during adolescence predicted self-reported violent reoffending in early adulthood, even after controlling for demographic factors. Victimization significantly increased the risk for re-arrest.\r\nFurther, this risk of re-offending was higher for male offenders than\r\nfor female offenders. Finally, callous-unemotional traits and hostility mediated the relationship between continuous violence exposure and later violent offending.\r\nIn this study, data from the Pathways to Desistance study were analyzed using SPSS and Mplus software packages, and the syntax files used to analyze the data have been included. The  Pathways to Desistance study datasets  are archived at the University of Michigan Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), and the PI obtained the Pathways data from ICPSR.",

Self-reported data were used for both maltreatment (measured at the latter two time points) and delinquent or criminal behaviors (measured at all three time points). Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to model growth curves of the frequency of violent and non-violent offending, from ages 13 to 30. Next, maltreatment frequency was tested as a predictor, and then potential protective factors (at peer, family, school, and neighborhood levels) were tested as moderators. Sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation were also tested as moderators of delinquent or criminal offense frequency, and as moderators of protective effects.\r\nThe study collection includes 1 Stata (.do) syntax file (AddHealthOJJDPAnalysis_StataSyntax.do) that was used by the researcher in secondary analyses of restricted-use data. The restricted archival data from the Add Health survey series are not included as part of this release.",

Data to inform both objectives was collected using a longitudinal multimode approach with youth, mentors and parents in the BBBS-KY program in the metro Louisville area. In addition, data from 16 local school districts provided measures of academic performance, school attendance, and disciplinary suspensions. Data were collected at multiple time points from youth, volunteer mentors, and parents/guardians. These data included BBBS-America standard surveys (Youth Outcomes Survey, and Volunteer and Youth Strength of Relationship Surveys). PIRE supplemented the standard BBBS data collection efforts with project-specific baseline volunteer mentor survey and several formative and outcome based inserts to supplement the data that was regularly collected from youth and mentors. The PIRE and BBBS-KY teams also created a project-specific parent/guardian survey to better understand the impact of parental factors on match dynamics and youth mentoring program outcomes. Due to low literacy levels of parents/guardians, this survey was administered as a mixed-mode, audio-computer assisted interview (ACASI). Additional data sources for this study included data from (a) coding of qualitative case review notes for selected aspects of matches by BBBS-KY match support specialists, (b) academic data collected from school districts, and (c) data collected on general match characteristics (e.g., match closure status) collected by BBBS-KY as part of their standard business operations.

PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three samples of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest sample, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30 percent within each grade sample on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 506 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 503 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest sample was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28. The middle sample was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23. The oldest sample was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35. Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains data and syntax files for delinquency constructs. The datasets include constructs on the frequency and level of criminal and delinquent activities, including theft, violence, weapons used, delinquency, drug-selling, white collar crime, as well as police contacts and past incarceration. Additionally, the collection includes data on delinquency risk (high vs. low) and the associated weight.\r\nThe delinquency constructs were created by using the PYS raw data. The raw data are available at ICPSR in the following studies:\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Youngest Sample (1987 - 2001) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania],\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Middle Sample (1987 - 1991) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] , and\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Oldest Sample (1987 - 2000) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].

Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 506 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 503 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest sample was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28. The middle sample was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23. The oldest sample was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35. Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains data and syntax files for delinquency constructs. The datasets include constructs on the frequency and level of criminal and delinquent activities, including theft, violence, weapons used, delinquency, drug-selling, white collar crime, as well as police contacts and past incarceration. Additionally, the collection includes data on delinquency risk (high vs. low) and the associated weight.\r\nThe delinquency constructs were created by using the PYS raw data. The raw data are available at ICPSR in the following studies:\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Youngest Sample (1987 - 2001) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania],\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Middle Sample (1987 - 1991) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] , and\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Oldest Sample (1987 - 2000) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].

The CJRP\r\nprovides a detailed picture of juveniles in custody and asks juvenile\r\nresidential custody facilities in the United States to describe each\r\nyouth assigned a bed in the facility on the specified reference\r\ndate. The CJRP reference date was generally the fourth Wednesday in\r\nOctober. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and\r\nfacility population are also collected. Some state and regional\r\nagencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their\r\njurisdiction. The CJRP facility inclusion criteria are: (1)\r\nresidential facilities in operation on the census reference date, (2)\r\npublic or private (or tribal since 1999) operation, and (3) intended\r\nfor juvenile offenders (although some hold adults as\r\nwell). Specifically excluded are: nonresidential facilities; detention\r\ncenters operated as part of adult jails; facilities exclusively for\r\ndrug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children;\r\nfoster homes; and federal correctional facilities (e.g., Immigration\r\nand Naturalization Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, United States\r\nMarshalls, or Bureau of Prisons). Inclusion criteria for\r\nindividual-level data are: (1) youth under age 21, (2) assigned a bed\r\nin a residential facility at the end of the day on the census\r\nreference day, (3) charged with an offense or court-adjudicated for an\r\noffense, (4) and in residential placement because of that\r\noffense.Years Produced: Biennially since 1997, in odd-numbered\r\nyears.

It also provides information on the use of bed space in the\r\nfacility to indicate whether the facility is experiencing\r\ncrowding. The JRFC includes questions about the type of facility, such\r\nas detention center, training school, ranch, or group home. This\r\ninformation is complemented by a series of questions about other\r\nresidential services provided by the facility, such as independent\r\nliving, foster care, or other arrangements. The JRFC uses four modules\r\nto collect information on the health care, education, substance abuse\r\ntreatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these\r\nfacilities. These four modules are not always collected each\r\nyear. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these\r\nservices, the JRFC gathers important information about the youth the\r\nservices are directed toward and how the services are provided. The\r\ncensus indicates the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine\r\ncounseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also\r\nexamines prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including\r\nthe restraint of youth and improper absences from the\r\nfacility. Congress requires the Office of Juvenile Justice and\r\nDelinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to report annually on the number of\r\ndeaths of juveniles in custody; JRFC collects information on such\r\ndeaths for the one-year period just prior to the census reference\r\ndate. The census reference date is the fourth Wednesday in\r\nOctober. The inclusion criteria for facilities are: (1) the facility\r\nmust house persons under the age of 21, (2) who were charged with or\r\nadjudicated for an offense, and (3) were present in the facility on\r\nthe reference date because of that offense. JRFC does not capture data\r\non adult prisons or jails, nor does it include facilities that are\r\nused exclusively for mental health or substance abuse treatment or for\r\ndependent children.Years Produced: Biennially since 2000, in\r\neven-numbered years.National Juvenile Corrections Data\r\nSummaryThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\r\nPrevention sponsored three series of national juvenile corrections\r\ndata collections:Census\r\nof Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter\r\nFacilities Series,Census\r\nof Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) Series, and\r\ntheJuvenile\r\nResidential Facility Census (JRFC) Series.The CJRP\r\nwas administered for the first time in 1997.

+            "description": "\r\n\r\nInvestigator(s): Office of\r\nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency\r\nPrevention\r\nThe Juvenile Residential\r\nFacility Census (JRFC) collects basic information on facility\r\ncharacteristics, including size, structure, security arrangements, and\r\nownership. It also provides information on the use of bed space in the\r\nfacility to indicate whether the facility is experiencing\r\ncrowding. The JRFC includes questions about the type of facility, such\r\nas detention center, training school, ranch, or group home. This\r\ninformation is complemented by a series of questions about other\r\nresidential services provided by the facility, such as independent\r\nliving, foster care, or other arrangements. The JRFC uses four modules\r\nto collect information on the health care, education, substance abuse\r\ntreatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these\r\nfacilities. These four modules are not always collected each\r\nyear. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these\r\nservices, the JRFC gathers important information about the youth the\r\nservices are directed toward and how the services are provided. The\r\ncensus indicates the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine\r\ncounseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also\r\nexamines prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including\r\nthe restraint of youth and improper absences from the\r\nfacility. Congress requires the Office of Juvenile Justice and\r\nDelinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to report annually on the number of\r\ndeaths of juveniles in custody; JRFC collects information on such\r\ndeaths for the one-year period just prior to the census reference\r\ndate. The census reference date is the fourth Wednesday in\r\nOctober. The inclusion criteria for facilities are: (1) the facility\r\nmust house persons under the age of 21, (2) who were charged with or\r\nadjudicated for an offense, and (3) were present in the facility on\r\nthe reference date because of that offense. JRFC does not capture data\r\non adult prisons or jails, nor does it include facilities that are\r\nused exclusively for mental health or substance abuse treatment or for\r\ndependent children.Years Produced: Biennially since 2000, in\r\neven-numbered years.National Juvenile Corrections Data\r\nSummaryThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\r\nPrevention sponsored three series of national juvenile corrections\r\ndata collections:Census\r\nof Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter\r\nFacilities Series,Census\r\nof Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) Series, and\r\ntheJuvenile\r\nResidential Facility Census (JRFC) Series.The CJRP\r\nwas administered for the first time in 1997. The CJRP replaced the\r\nCensus of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and\r\nShelter Facilities (formerly called the Juvenile Detention and\r\nCorrectional Facility Census series and also known as the Children in\r\nCustody (CIC) census), which had been conducted since the early\r\n1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC\r\ncollected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g.,\r\nnumber of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP collects an\r\nindividual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to\r\nprovide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The companion data\r\ncollection to CJRP, the JRFC, is designed to collect information about\r\nthe facilities in which juvenile offenders are held.ICPSR\r\nmerged data from the CJRP\r\nseries with data from the JRFC\r\nseries. These studies are included in the Matched\r\nCensus of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP)/Juvenile\r\nResidential Facility Census (JRFC)\r\nSeries.\r\n",

CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 2001, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.",

This information was complemented by a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. In 2000, the JRFC used four modules to collect information on the physical health services, educational services, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathered important information about the youth the services were directed toward and how the services were provided. The census indicated the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examined prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility. Congress requires the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to report annually on the number of deaths of juveniles in custody; JRFC collected information on such deaths for the one-year period just prior to the census reference date.

Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30 percent within each grade sample on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up.

PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three samples of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest sample, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30 percent within each grade sample on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 506 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 503 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest sample was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28. The middle sample was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23. The oldest sample was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35. Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, neighborhood).

PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three samples of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest sample, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30 percent within each grade sample on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 506 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 503 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest sample was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28. The middle sample was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23. The oldest sample was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35. Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.\r\nThis collection contains data and syntax files for peers constructs. The datasets include constructs on community involvement, gang membership, peers' conventional activities, friends as a bad influence, peer delinquency, peer rejection, proportion of offenses committed alone, and victimization.\r\nThe peers constructs were created by using the PYS raw data.

CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 2007, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.",

Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.",

While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathered important information about the youth the services were directed toward and how the services were provided. The census indicated the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examined prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility.

The original sample included 1829 randomly selected youth, 1172 males and 657 females, then 10 to 18 years old, enrolled in the study as they entered the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center from 1995 to 1998.  Among the sample were 1005 African Americans, 524 Hispanics, 296 non-Hispanic white respondents.\r\nParticipants were tracked from the time they left detention.  Re-interviews were conducted regardless of where respondents were living when their follow-up interview was due: in the community, correctional settings, or by telephone if they lived farther than two hours from Chicago.",

In addition, interviews with one primary caretaker of each student were conducted eight times at six-month intervals from the Spring of 1988 until the Fall of 1991. The interviews lasted about an hour and cover a wide range of topics including social class position, family structure and processes, educational success, peer relationships, neighborhood characteristics, psychological functioning, social networks, and social support systems, and involvement in prosocial and antisocial behaviors.  When appropriate, the research team collected similar information from both the students and parents to provide multiple perspectives on these developmental issues.

-            "description": "The Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) is part of the larger \"Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency\" initiated by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in 1986. PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three cohorts of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest cohorts, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30% within each grade cohort on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 503 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 506 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, and teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest cohort was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28.  The middle cohort was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23.  The oldest cohort was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35.  Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, and neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.\r\nThis collection contains data and syntax files for mental health constructs. The datasets include constructs on symptoms and contributing factors from both the DSM-IIIR and DSM-IV for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Anxiety, Conduct Disorder, depressed mood, substance abuse, Major Depressive Episode and Dysthymia, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Psychopathy with and without delinquency, Schizophrenia, help-seeking behavior, institutionalization, and other diagnoses and constructs. Additionally, the collection includes data on scores from the following scales: Problem Scale, DSM-Oriented Scale, Child Behavior Checklist (CBPRB), and Young Adult Problem Scales.\r\nThe mental health constructs were created by using the PYS raw data. The raw data are available at ICPSR in the following studies:\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Youngest Sample (1987 - 2001) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania],\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Middle Sample (1987 - 1991) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Oldest Sample (1987 - 2000) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].

PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three cohorts of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest cohorts, respectively). Using a screening risk score that measured each boy's antisocial behavior, boys identified at the top 30% within each grade cohort on the screening risk measure (n=~250), as well as an equal number of boys randomly selected from the remainder (n=~250), were selected for follow-up. Consequently, the final sample for the study consisted of 1,517 total students selected for follow-up. 503 of these students were in the oldest sample, 508 were in the middle sample, and 506 were in the youngest sample.\r\nAssessments were conducted semiannually and then annually using multiple informants (i.e., boys, parents, and teachers) between 1987 and 2010. The youngest cohort was assessed from ages 6-19 and again at ages 25 and 28.  The middle cohort was assessed from ages 9-13 and again at age 23.  The oldest cohort was assessed from ages 13-25, with an additional assessment at age 35.  Information has been collected on a broad range of risk and protective factors across multiple domains (e.g., individual, family, peer, school, and neighborhood).  Measures of conduct problems, substance use/abuse, criminal behavior, mental health problems have been collected.\r\nThis collection contains data and syntax files for mental health constructs. The datasets include constructs on symptoms and contributing factors from both the DSM-IIIR and DSM-IV for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Anxiety, Conduct Disorder, depressed mood, substance abuse, Major Depressive Episode and Dysthymia, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Psychopathy with and without delinquency, Schizophrenia, help-seeking behavior, institutionalization, and other diagnoses and constructs. Additionally, the collection includes data on scores from the following scales: Problem Scale, DSM-Oriented Scale, Child Behavior Checklist (CBPRB), and Young Adult Problem Scales.\r\nThe mental health constructs were created by using the PYS raw data. The raw data are available at ICPSR in the following studies:\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Youngest Sample (1987 - 2001) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania],\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Middle Sample (1987 - 1991) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and\r\nPittsburgh Youth Study Oldest Sample (1987 - 2000) [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].

CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP, which is conducted biennially, collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. In 1999, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children.",

To address issues of psychological consequences, the events\r\n occurring prior to child loss, during the experience of child loss,\r\n and after child recovery (if applicable) were studied from multiple\r\n perspectives within the family by interviewing parents, spouses,\r\n siblings, and, when possible, the missing child. A sample of 249\r\n families with one or more missing children were followed with in-home\r\n interviews, in a time series measurement design. Three time periods\r\n were used: Time Series 1, within 45 days of disappearance, Time Series\r\n 2, at 4 months post-disappearance, and Time Series 3, at 8 months\r\n post-disappearance. Three groups of missing children and their\r\n families were studied: loss from alleged nonfamily abduction\r\n (stranger), loss by alleged family or parental abduction, and loss by\r\n alleged runaway. Cases were selected from four confidential sites in\r\n the United States. The files in this collection consist of data from\r\n detailed structured interviews (Parts 1-22) and selected quantitative\r\n nationally-normed measurement instruments (Parts 23-33). Structured\r\n interview items covered: (1) family of origin for parents of the\r\n missing child or children, (2) demographics of the current family with\r\n the missing child or children, (3) conditions in the family before the\r\n child's disappearance, (4) circumstances of the child's disappearance,\r\n (5) perception of the child's disappearance, (6) missing child search,\r\n (7) nonmissing child, concurrent family stress, (8) coping with the\r\n child's disappearance, (9) coping with a nonmissing child, concurrent\r\n family stress, (10) missing child recovery, if applicable, (11)\r\n recovered child reunification with family, if applicable, and (12)\r\n resource and assistance evaluation. With respect to intervention\r\n services, utilization of and satisfaction with these services were\r\n assessed in each of the following categories: law enforcement\r\n services, mental health services, missing child center services,\r\n within-family social support, and community social support. The\r\n quantitative instruments collected data on family members' stress\r\n levels and reactions to stress, using the Symptom Check List-90,\r\n Achenbach Child Behavior Check List, Family Inventory of Life Events,\r\n F-COPES, Frederick Trauma Reaction Index-Adult, and Frederick Trauma\r\nReaction Index-Child.",

Information provided about each facility \r\n includes the problems, conditions, and patterns of behavior of their \r\n residents, the treatment programs for them, and the extent of their \r\n participation in community activities.

-            "description": "The Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) is part of the larger \"Program of Research on the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency\" initiated by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in 1986. PYS aims to document the development of antisocial and delinquent behavior from childhood to early adulthood, the risk factors that impinge on that development, and help seeking and service provision of boys' behavior problems. The study also focuses on boys' development of alcohol and drug use, and internalizing problems.\r\nPYS consists of three samples of boys who were in the first, fourth, and seventh grades in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania public schools during the 1987-1988 academic year (called the youngest, middle, and oldest sample, respectively).

DYS variables also address family demographics, neighborhood characteristics, parenting, and involvement in social roles.\r\nThe DYS is based on a probability sample of households in \"high-risk\" neighborhoods of Denver, Colorado. These neighborhoods were selected on the basis of their social ecology in terms of population and housing characteristics. Only socially disorganized neighborhoods with high (top one-third) official crime rates were included. The survey respondents include 1,528 children and youth who were 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15 years old in 1987, and one of their parents, who lived in one of the more than 20,000 randomly selected households.\r\nThe survey respondents include 807 boys and 721 girls and include White (10%), Latino (45%), and African American (33%) youth, as well as 12% from other racial/ethnic backgrounds. The child and youth respondents, along with one caretaker, were interviewed annually from 1988 until 1992 (waves 1-5), annually from 1995 until 1999 (waves 6-10), and in 2003 (wave 11). The study covers an age range of 7 through 26.",

Between November, 2000 and January, 2003, 1,354 adjudicated\r\nyouths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County\r\n(Phoenix), Arizona (N = 654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N\r\n= 700) were enrolled into the study.The enrolled youth were at\r\nleast 14 years old and under 18 years old at the time of their\r\ncommitting offense and were found guilty of a serious offense\r\n(predominantly felonies, with a few exceptions for some misdemeanor\r\nproperty offenses, sexual assault, or weapons offenses).Each\r\nstudy participant was followed for a period of seven years past\r\nenrollment, with the end result a comprehensive picture of life\r\nchanges in a wide array of areas over the course of this\r\ntime.The study sought to inform the ongoing debate in the\r\njuvenile justice system regarding the treatment and processing of\r\nserious adolescent offenders. The larger aim of the Pathways series is\r\nto improve decision-making by court and social service personnel and\r\nto clarify policy debates about alternatives for serious adolescent\r\noffenders.Additional datasets from the Pathways study will be\r\nreleased during 2013. These datasets will include\r\nofficial records information (e.g. re-arrest, placement), and monthly\r\nlife-calendar data on a range of topics (e.g.  school, work). These\r\nadditional datasets will not be publicly available, but rather made\r\navailable through ICPSR's restricted data access system.For\r\nmore information, please visit the Research on Pathways to\r\nDesistance web site.\r\n",

Between November, 2000 and January, 2003, 1,354 adjudicated\r\nyouths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County\r\n(Phoenix), Arizona (N = 654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N\r\n= 700) were enrolled into the study.The enrolled youth were at\r\nleast 14 years old and under 18 years old at the time of their\r\ncommitting offense and were found guilty of a serious offense\r\n(predominantly felonies, with a few exceptions for some misdemeanor\r\nproperty offenses, sexual assault, or weapons offenses).Each\r\nstudy participant was followed for a period of seven years past\r\nenrollment, with the end result a comprehensive picture of life\r\nchanges in a wide array of areas over the course of this\r\ntime.The study sought to inform the ongoing debate in the\r\njuvenile justice system regarding the treatment and processing of\r\nserious adolescent offenders. The larger aim of the Pathways series is\r\nto improve decision-making by court and social service personnel and\r\nto clarify policy debates about alternatives for serious adolescent\r\noffenders.Additional datasets from the Pathways study will be\r\nreleased during 2013. These datasets will include\r\nofficial records information (e.g. re-arrest, placement), and monthly\r\nlife-calendar data on a range of topics (e.g.  school, work). These\r\nadditional datasets will not be publicly available, but rather made\r\navailable through ICPSR's restricted data access system.For\r\nmore information, please visit the Research on Pathways to\r\nDesistance web site.\r\n",

Follow-up interviews were then scheduled with the respondents at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months past their baseline interview.The enrolled youth were at least 14 years old and under 18 years old at the time of their committing offense and were found guilty of a serious offense (predominantly felonies, with a few exceptions for some misdemeanor property offenses, sexual assault, or weapons offenses).\r\nThe baseline interview was conducted within 75 days of the youth's adjudication hearing. For youths in the adult system, the baseline interview was conducted within 90 days of either (a) the decertification hearing in Philadelphia, a hearing at which it is determined if the case will remain in adult court or if it will be sent back to juvenile court; or (b) the adult arraignment hearing in Phoenix, the point in the Arizona adult system at which charges have been formally presented.\r\nThe aims of the investigation were to identify initial patterns of how serious adolescent offenders stop antisocial activity, to describe the role of social context and developmental changes in promoting these positive changes, and to compare the effects of sanctions and interventions in promoting these changes. The larger goals of the Pathways to Desistance study were to improve decision-making by court and social service personnel and to clarify policy debates about alternatives for serious adolescent offenders.

Enrolled into the study were adjudicated youths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona (N=654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N=700) from 2000 through 2010.This study looks at interviews conducted with the collateral informants who participated in the study. The collateral informants were nominated by the main study participant and represented individuals who \"knew the study participant well\". At the interview baseline the collateral informant was usually a biological parent. During the three follow-up interviews the majority of collaterals were a friend. Collateral informants could also be a sibling, significant other, or relative. Collaterals were asked questions in regards to the main study participant's life, allowing for comparison between responses provided by two sources. A baseline interview was conducted with the collateral after the baseline interview took place with the main participant. Additional waves of follow-up with collaterals took place at 12, 24, and 36 months.

The release interview was conducted within 30 days prior to or after release from a facility and in a separate session apart from the time point interview.

On the basis of the number of reported institutional stays in the sample, it is estimated that a release interview was obtained for approximately 54 percent of the total number of residential stays experienced by study participants. Release interviews were missed if the research interviewer was not aware of the institutional stay (e.g. it occurred between time point interviews) or if the interviewer only became aware of the institutional stay at a point that was too late to schedule a release interview within the required window surrounding the release date.The 686 individuals reflected in the release data represent 51 percent of the Pathway study participants (n=1,354) and 56 percent of Pathways participants who had a least one institutional stay (n=1,234; 120 Pathways youths had no institutional stays).

Follow-up interviews were then scheduled with the respondents at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months past their baseline interview.The enrolled youth were at least 14 years old and under 18 years old at the time of their committing offense and were found guilty of a serious offense (predominantly felonies, with a few exceptions for some misdemeanor property offenses, sexual assault, or weapons offenses).\r\nEach wave of data collection covered six domains: (1) background characteristics (e.g., demographics, academic achievement, psychiatric diagnoses, offense history, neurological functioning, psychopathy, personality), (2) indicators of individual functioning (e.g., work and school status and performance, substance abuse, mental disorder, antisocial behavior), (3) psychosocial development and attitudes (e.g., impulse control, susceptibility to peer influence, perceptions of opportunity, perceptions of procedural justice, moral disengagement), (4) family context (e.g., household composition, quality of family relationships), (5) personal relationships (e.g., quality of romantic relationships and friendships, peer delinquency, contacts with caring adults), and (6) community context (e.g., neighborhood conditions, personal capital, and community involvement).

Enrolled into the study were adjudicated youths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona (N=654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N=700).\r\nThe Release data portion of the Pathways study contains information from 1,130 interviews (\"release interviews\") reflecting the youths' perceptions regarding various aspects of the residential experience and institutional environment (e.g., accounts of program operations and services provided, ratings regarding the participant's feelings of his or her safety in the facility). The release interview was conducted within 30 days prior to or after release from a facility and in a separate session apart from the time point interview. This was done to minimize the burden on the research participant and to ensure adequate attention to institutional ratings. The restricted time period within which to conduct the release interview reduced the likelihood that intervening events and experiences would skew the participant's recall of the stay.\r\nStudy participants could contribute more than one release interview, depending upon the number of institutional placements he/she had over the seven-year follow-up period. The current release data reflects ratings from 686 unique individuals. It should be recognized that not every institutional stay for every youth produced a release interview. On the basis of the number of reported institutional stays in the sample, it is estimated that a release interview was obtained for approximately 54 percent of the total number of residential stays experienced by study participants. Release interviews were missed if the research interviewer was not aware of the institutional stay (e.g. it occurred between time point interviews) or if the interviewer only became aware of the institutional stay at a point that was too late to schedule a release interview within the required window surrounding the release date.\r\nThe 686 individuals reflected in the release data represent 51 percent of the Pathway study participants (n=1,354) and 56 percent of Pathways participants who had a least one institutional stay (n=1,234; 120 Pathways youths had no institutional stays). On average, these 686 youths had 1.6 interviews. The number of interviews per unique person ranges from one to eight.\r\nThe current Release Measures study primarily consists of the calculated scores from constructs asked about during the interviews, but the individual scale items were withheld at that time. This study contains those individual items plus the calculated scores.",

Enrolled into the study were adjudicated youths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona (N=654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N=700).\r\nThe Release data portion of the Pathways study contains information from 1,130 interviews (\"release interviews\") reflecting the youths' perceptions regarding various aspects of the residential experience and institutional environment (e.g., accounts of program operations and services provided, ratings regarding the participant's feelings of his or her safety in the facility). The release interview was conducted within 30 days prior to or after release from a facility and in a separate session apart from the time point interview. This was done to minimize the burden on the research participant and to ensure adequate attention to institutional ratings. The restricted time period within which to conduct the release interview reduced the likelihood that intervening events and experiences would skew the participant's recall of the stay.\r\nStudy participants could contribute more than one release interview, depending upon the number of institutional placements he/she had over the seven-year follow-up period. The current release data reflects ratings from 686 unique individuals. It should be recognized that not every institutional stay for every youth produced a release interview. On the basis of the number of reported institutional stays in the sample, it is estimated that a release interview was obtained for approximately 54 percent of the total number of residential stays experienced by study participants. Release interviews were missed if the research interviewer was not aware of the institutional stay (e.g. it occurred between time point interviews) or if the interviewer only became aware of the institutional stay at a point that was too late to schedule a release interview within the required window surrounding the release date.\r\nThe 686 individuals reflected in the release data represent 51 percent of the Pathway study participants (n=1,354) and 56 percent of Pathways participants who had a least one institutional stay (n=1,234; 120 Pathways youths had no institutional stays). On average, these 686 youths had 1.6 interviews. The number of interviews per unique person ranges from one to eight.\r\nThe current Release Measures study primarily consists of the calculated scores from constructs asked about during the interviews, but the individual scale items were withheld at that time. This study contains those individual items plus the calculated scores.",

The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. For 1997, the reference date was the fifth Wednesday in October. For 1999-2003 and 2007, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. For 2006 and 2010, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in February. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected in the CJRP. The JRFC collected information on facility characteristics, including size, structure, security arrangements, ownership, and use of bed space in the facility. The JRFC used four modules to collect information on the physical health services, educational services, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. These four modules were not always collected each year. The JRFC also identified the type of facility, which was complemented with a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. The JRFC has been administered biennially since 2000, in even-numbered years. The JRFC census reference date is the fourth Wednesday in October. Each record in the concatenated matched data file provides information about the juvenile and also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held from both the CJRP and JRFC collections. Therefore, these data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Only facilities that held at least one juvenile for an offense on the CJRP census reference date are included in this file, i.e., all facilities in the biennial JRFC data may not be included in this concatenated matched file. Data were harmonized so that variables present across years are identically named to facilitate analysis.",

The CJRP asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. For 1997, the reference date was the fifth Wednesday in October. For 1999-2003 and 2007, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. For 2006 and 2010, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in February. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected in the CJRP. The JRFC collected information on facility characteristics, including size, structure, security arrangements, ownership, and use of bed space in the facility. The JRFC used four modules to collect information on the physical health services, educational services, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. These four modules were not always collected each year. The JRFC also identified the type of facility, which was complemented with a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. The JRFC has been administered biennially since 2000, in even-numbered years. The JRFC census reference date is the fourth Wednesday in October. Records in the concatenated matched data file (ICPSR 27543) were aggregated to the facility level. Therefore, the CJRP/JRFC concatenated matched facility-level data provide information about the characteristics of the facility from both the CJRP and JRFC collections and the juvenile population held in that facility from the CJRP collection. Only facilities that held at least one juvenile for an offense on the CJRP census reference date are included in this file, i.e., all facilities in the biennial JRFC data may not be included in this concatenated matched facility-level file. Data were harmonized so that variables present across years are identically named to facilitate analysis.",

The data described herein\r\nrepresent two waves of surveys of residents living in the highest-crime, lowest-income residential street segments in the six National Initiative cities.\r\nThe first wave was conducted between September 2015 and January 2016, and the second wave was conducted between July and October 2017. Survey items were designed to measure neighborhood residents' perceptions of their neighborhood conditions--with particular emphases on neighborhood safety, disorder, and victimization--and perceptions of the police as it relates to procedural justice, police legitimacy, officer trust, community-focused policing, police bias, willingness to partner with the police on solving crime, and the law.\r\nThe data described herein are from pre- and post-training assessment surveys of officers who participated in three trainings: 1) procedural justice (PJ) conceptual training, which is the application of PJ in the context of law enforcement-civilian interactions, as well as its role in mitigating historical tensions between law enforcement and communities of color; 2) procedural justice tactical, which provided simulation and scenario-based exercises and techniques to operationalize PJ principles in officers' daily activities; and 3) implicit bias, which engaged officers in critical thought about racial bias, and prepared them to better identify and handle identity traps that enable implicit biases. Surveys for the procedural justice conceptual training were fielded between December 2015 and July 2016; procedural justice tactical between February 2016 and June 2017; and implicit bias between September 2016 and April 2018. Survey items were designed to measure officers' understanding of procedural justice and implicit bias concepts, as well as officers' levels of satisfaction with the trainings.",

There were two main objectives: to assess the relations between program practice implementation and youth and match outcomes among mentoring programs in a national network, and to understand the experiences that programs had while embarking on a quality improvement initiative that was focused on improving program practices. Variables include program benchmarks achieved, mentee's school records, relationships with their parents, and staff member's feelings towards their program. Additionally, 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 MYL program representatives. Mentee's age, gender, race, and ethnicity were also recorded.",

CJRP replaced the Census of Public and Private Juvenile Detention, Correctional, and Shelter Facilities, also known as the Children in Custody (CIC) census, which had been conducted since the early 1970s. The CJRP differs fundamentally from CIC in that the CIC collected aggregate data on juveniles held in each facility (e.g., number of juveniles in the facility) and the CJRP collects an individual record on each juvenile held in the residential facility to provide a detailed picture of juveniles in custody. The CJRP, which is conducted biennially, asked juvenile residential custody facilities in the United States to describe each youth assigned a bed in the facility on a specified reference date. For 1997, the reference date was the fifth Wednesday in October. For 1999-2003 and 2007, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in October. For 2006 and 2010, the reference date was the fourth Wednesday in February. Characteristics of the facility, treatment services, and facility population were also collected. Each record in the data that provides information about a juvenile also includes the characteristics of the facility in which the juvenile was held. Therefore, the CJRP data can be analyzed at the juvenile or facility level. Some state and regional agencies provide CJRP data for more than one facility under their jurisdiction. The census was not sent to adult facilities or to facilities exclusively for drug or mental health treatment or for abused or neglected children. The concatenated data include the seven years of CJRP data in one file. Data were harmonized so that variables present across years are identically named to facilitate analysis.",

It also collected information on the use of bedspace in the facility to indicate whether the facility was experiencing crowding. The JRFC included questions about the type of facility, such as detention center, training school, ranch, or group home. This information was complemented by a series of questions about other residential services provided by the facility, such as independent living, foster care, or other arrangements. JRFC used four modules to collect information on the physical health services, educational services, substance abuse treatment, and mental health treatment provided to youth in these facilities. These four modules were not always collected each year. While not evaluating the effectiveness or quality of these services, the JRFC gathered important information about the youth the services were directed toward and how the services were provided. The census indicated the use of screenings or tests conducted to determine counseling, education, health, or substance abuse needs, and also examined prominent issues about conditions of confinement, including the restraint of youth and improper absences from the facility. The JRFC has been administered biennially since 2000, in even-numbered years. The census reference date is the fourth Wednesday in October.",
