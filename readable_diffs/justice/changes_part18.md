Synthetic drugs\r\n investigated in the collection include PCP, ice, ecstasy, and speed,\r\n while nonsynthetic drugs include alcohol, marijuana, heroin, cocaine,\r\n and crack. Patterns of use for all of these drugs are explored.\r\n Questions about specific drugs include whether the respondent had ever\r\n used the drug, age first used, number of days in the past 30 days the\r\n drug was used, whether the drug was used more than two times per week,\r\n method of drug intake, and the drug used most often by the respondent\r\n and by the respondent's friends. Additional variables include reasons\r\n for preferring synthetic or nonsynthetic drugs, reasons the respondent\r\n would discontinue use or switch to another drug, availability and cost\r\n of certain drugs, and extent of involvement in selling, money handling,\r\n and protection. Finally, demographic variables such as sex, ethnicity,\r\n age, highest grade completed, employment activity in the past month,\r\n geographical location, and subject source (criminal justice system or\r\n drug treatment center) are included in the file. The unit of analysis\r\nis the individual drug user.",

-            "description": "A leading sociological theory of crime is the \"routine\r\n activities\" approach (Cohen and Felson, 1979). The premise of this\r\n theory is that the rate of occurrence of crime is affected by the\r\n convergence in time and space of three elements: motivated offenders,\r\n suitable targets, and the absence of guardianship against crime. The\r\n purpose of this study was to provide empirical evidence for the routine\r\n activities theory by investigating criminal data on places. This study\r\n deviates from traditional criminology research by analyzing places\r\n instead of collectivities as units of spatial analysis. There are two\r\n phases to this study. The purpose of the first phase was to test\r\n whether crime occurs randomly in space or is concentrated in \"hot\r\n spots\". Telephone calls for police service made in 1985 and 1986 to\r\n the Minneapolis Police Department were analyzed for patterns and\r\n concentration of repeat calls and were statistically tested for\r\n randomness. For the second phase of the study, two field experiments\r\n were designed to test the effectiveness of a proactive police strategy\r\n called Repeat Complaint Address Policing (RECAP). Samples of\r\n residential and commercial addresses that generated the most\r\n concentrated and most frequent repeat calls were divided into groups of\r\n experimental and control addresses, resulting in matched pairs. The\r\n experimental addresses were then subjected to a more focused proactive\r\n policing. The purposes of the RECAP experimentation were to test the\r\n effectiveness of proactive police strategy, as measured through the\r\n reduction in the incidence of calls to the police and, in so doing, to\r\n provide empirical evidence on the routine activities theory. Variables\r\n in this collection include the number of calls for police service in\r\n both 1986 and 1987 to the control addresses for each experimental pair,\r\n the number of calls for police service in both 1986 and 1987 to the\r\n experimental addresses for each experimental pair, numerical\r\n differences between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the control\r\n addresses and experimental addresses in each experimental pair,\r\n percentage difference between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the\r\n control addresses and the experimental addresses in each experimental\r\n pair, and a variable that indicates whether the experimental\r\n pair was used in the experimental analysis. The unit of observation for\r\n the first phase of the study is the recorded telephone call to the\r\n Minneapolis Police Department for police service and assistance. The\r\n unit of analysis for the second phase is the matched pair of control\r\n and experimental addresses for both the residential and commercial\r\naddress samples of the RECAP experiments.",

The premise of this\r\n theory is that the rate of occurrence of crime is affected by the\r\n convergence in time and space of three elements: motivated offenders,\r\n suitable targets, and the absence of guardianship against crime. The\r\n purpose of this study was to provide empirical evidence for the routine\r\n activities theory by investigating criminal data on places. This study\r\n deviates from traditional criminology research by analyzing places\r\n instead of collectivities as units of spatial analysis. There are two\r\n phases to this study. The purpose of the first phase was to test\r\n whether crime occurs randomly in space or is concentrated in \"hot\r\n spots\". Telephone calls for police service made in 1985 and 1986 to\r\n the Minneapolis Police Department were analyzed for patterns and\r\n concentration of repeat calls and were statistically tested for\r\n randomness. For the second phase of the study, two field experiments\r\n were designed to test the effectiveness of a proactive police strategy\r\n called Repeat Complaint Address Policing (RECAP). Samples of\r\n residential and commercial addresses that generated the most\r\n concentrated and most frequent repeat calls were divided into groups of\r\n experimental and control addresses, resulting in matched pairs. The\r\n experimental addresses were then subjected to a more focused proactive\r\n policing. The purposes of the RECAP experimentation were to test the\r\n effectiveness of proactive police strategy, as measured through the\r\n reduction in the incidence of calls to the police and, in so doing, to\r\n provide empirical evidence on the routine activities theory. Variables\r\n in this collection include the number of calls for police service in\r\n both 1986 and 1987 to the control addresses for each experimental pair,\r\n the number of calls for police service in both 1986 and 1987 to the\r\n experimental addresses for each experimental pair, numerical\r\n differences between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the control\r\n addresses and experimental addresses in each experimental pair,\r\n percentage difference between calls in 1987 and 1986 for both the\r\n control addresses and the experimental addresses in each experimental\r\n pair, and a variable that indicates whether the experimental\r\n pair was used in the experimental analysis. The unit of observation for\r\n the first phase of the study is the recorded telephone call to the\r\n Minneapolis Police Department for police service and assistance. The\r\n unit of analysis for the second phase is the matched pair of control\r\n and experimental addresses for both the residential and commercial\r\naddress samples of the RECAP experiments.",

The study involved the administration of key stakeholder surveys as part of a process evaluation of the HOPE program and the comparison of HOPE probationers with control-group probationers on two primary outcome measures: no-shows for probation appointments and positive urine tests for illicit-substance use. For Part 1 and Part 2, data were collected from administrative data sources. Missed Appointments Data (Part 1) were collected from 2007 to 2009 on a total of 1,174 probationers including 1,078 HOPE probationers, 78 comparison probationers, and 18 probationers for which study group information was not available. Specifically, for Part 1, the research team compiled data on the proportion of missed appointments in the three-month period before the study start date (baseline), in the three-month period following baseline, and in the six-month period following baseline. Drug Test Results Data (Part 2) were collected from 2007 to 2009 on the same 1,174 probationers. Specifically, for Part 2, the research team compiled data on the proportion of positive urine tests in the three-month period before the study start date (baseline), in the three-month period following baseline, and in the six-month period following baseline. Stakeholder survey data were collected from September 2008 through March 2009 on 50 Integrated Community Sanctions or \"Specialized Unit\" probationers (Part 3), 28 probationers in treatment (Part 4), 16 probationers in jail (Part 5), 20 probation officers in the Integrated Community Sanctions Unit (Part 6), 11 public defenders (Part 7), 12 prosecutors (Part 8), 7 judges (Part 9), and 11 court staff (Part 10). Part 1 contains a total of eight variables including group (high intensity or control), demographics, and mean missed appointments scores for three periods. Part 2 contains a total of eight variables including group (high intensity or control), demographics, and mean positive urine tests for illicit-substance use scores for three periods.

Additionally, the study explored the impact of key demographic variables of race and ethnicity, relationship to the presumed abuser, and age at the time of the survey on perceived barriers of victims. To address these research questions this study tested an empirical model that described relevant factors regarding perceived barriers to help-seeking and explored if and how this model changed based on the identified variables. Study participants represented a community sample of females age 50 years and older interested in participating in research regarding conflict in close personal relationships experienced by women in this target age range. Specific aims for the project were intended to lead to increased knowledge regarding perceived barriers to help-seeking among older women and, in particular, to develop a basis for describing (a) if and how these perceived barriers were unique to domestic abuse victims relative to non-victims in this age group and (b) how they varied based on selected variables.",

Additionally, the study explored the impact of key demographic variables of race and ethnicity, relationship to the presumed abuser, and age at the time of the survey on perceived barriers of victims. To address these research questions this study tested an empirical model that described relevant factors regarding perceived barriers to help-seeking and explored if and how this model changed based on the identified variables. Study participants represented a community sample of females age 50 years and older interested in participating in research regarding conflict in close personal relationships experienced by women in this target age range. Specific aims for the project were intended to lead to increased knowledge regarding perceived barriers to help-seeking among older women and, in particular, to develop a basis for describing (a) if and how these perceived barriers were unique to domestic abuse victims relative to non-victims in this age group and (b) how they varied based on selected variables.",

-            "description": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the Safe City crime prevention model that was implemented in designated retail areas in jurisdictions across the United States. The model involved frequent meetings and information-sharing among the police, Target, and neighboring retailers, along with the implementation of enhanced technology.  The first step in the Safe City evaluation involved selecting evaluation sites.  The final sites selected were Chula Vista, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Next, for each of the two sites, researchers selected a site that had a potential for crime displacement caused by the intervention area, and a matched comparison area in another jurisdiction that would likely have been selected as a Safe City site.  For Chula Vista, the displacement area was 2 miles east of the intervention area and the comparison area was in Houston, Texas.  For Cincinnati, the displacement area was 1.5 miles north of the intervention area and the comparison area was in Buffalo, New York.  In Chula Vista, the Safe City intervention activities were focused on gaining a better understanding of the nature and underlying causes of the crime and disorder problems occurring in the designated Safe City site, and strengthening pre-existing partnerships between law enforcement and businesses affected by these problems.  In Cincinnati, the Safe City intervention activities centered on increasing business and citizen awareness, communication, and involvement in crime control and prevention activities.  The research team collected pre- and post-intervention crime data from local police departments (Part 1) to measure the impact of the Safe City initiatives in Chula Vista and Cincinnati.  The 981 records in Part 1 contain monthly crime counts from January 2004 to November 2008 for various types of crime in the retail areas that received the intervention in Chula Vista and Cincinnati, and their corresponding displacement zones and matched comparison areas.  Using the monthly crime counts contained in the Safe City Monthly Crime Data (Part 1) and estimations of the total cost of crime to society for various offenses from prior research, the research team calculated the total cost of crimes reported during the month/year for each crime type that was readily available (Part 2).  The 400 records in the Safe City Monthly Cost Benefit Analysis Data (Part 2) contain monthly crime cost estimates from January 2004 to November 2008 for assaults, burglaries, larcenies, and robberies in the retail areas that received the intervention in Chula Vista and Cincinnati, and their corresponding displacement zones and matched comparison areas.  The research team also received a total of 192 completed baseline and follow-up surveys with businesses in Chula Vista and Cincinnati in 2007 and 2008 (Part 3).  The surveys collected data on merchants' perceptions of crime and safety in and around businesses located in the Safe City areas.  The Safe City Monthly Crime Data (Part 1) contain seven variables including the number of crimes in the target area, the month and year the crime was committed, the number of crimes in the displacement area, the number of crimes in a comparable area in a comparable city, the city, and the crime type.  The Safe City Monthly Cost Benefit Analysis Data (Part 2) contain seven variables including the cost of the specified type of crime occurring in the target area, the month and year the cost was incurred, the cost of the specified type of crime in the displacement area, the cost of the specified type of crime in a matched comparison area, the city, and the crime type. The Safe City Business Survey Data (Part 3) contain 132 variables relating to perceptions of safety, contact with local police, experience and reporting of crime, impact of crime, crime prevention, community connections, and business/employee information.",

The goal was to test the efficacy of SANE/SART programs as a tool in the criminal justice system. The American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College tested the hypotheses that SANE/SART exams increase arrest and prosecution rates. The researchers collected case information from SANE/SART, police, and prosecution files in three jurisdictions: Monmouth County (Freehold), New Jersey, Sedgwick County (Wichita), Kansas, and Suffolk County (Boston), Massachusetts. At each study site, the project team randomly selected up to 125 sexual assault cases in which there was a SANE or SART intervention and 125 cases in which there was no SANE/SART intervention from cases that were opened and closed between 1997 and 2001. Comparisons were sought between SANE/SART cases (both SANE only and SANE/SART combined) and non-SANE/SART cases to determine if the intervention predicted the likelihood of certain criminal justice system outcomes. These outcomes included identification/arrest of a suspect, the filing of charges, case disposition, type of penalty, and length of sentence. In addition, researchers collected information on a number of other variables that could impact or mitigate the effect of SANE/SART interventions and case outcomes. The researchers abstracted information from case files maintained by SANE programs, police incident/arrest reports, and prosecution files during intensive five-day site visits. Three standardized records abstraction forms were developed to collect data: (1) the incident form was designed to collect data from police reports and the prosecution files about the actual sexual assault, (2) the case abstraction form was designed to collect prosecution data and case outcome data from the prosecutors' case files, and (3) the SANE/SART data collection form collected information from the SANE/SART files about the SANE/SART intervention. Specific information regarding the evidence collected during the victim's exam, nature of the assault, evidence/forensic kits collected, victim's demeanor, weapon(s) used, number of assailants, and the victim/offender relationship were collected.",

In contrast, a majority of Harborview clients were White (59 percent), although Harborview also had many non-White, non-Hispanic clients. Approximately half of the eligible candidates were randomly assigned to participate in a four-hour workshop on avoiding sexual assault while the others were assigned to a control condition that did not receive the training. Both groups participated in a baseline assessment battery administered in person. After completion of the assessment, those assigned to the experimental condition began the workshop. Researchers contacted women in both groups six months later for a second assessment, this time conducted over the phone.

The secondary research goal of this study was to explore family court decision-making and the nature of family court processing. Study subjects were chosen by examining Family Court calendars in all five New York City boroughs for each day in April, May, and June of 2000, which identified every youth who received a disposition during this period. Research staff located case files for each subject in probation department file rooms in the five family courts, using personal and numeric identifiers taken from court calendars. Using a standardized data collection instrument that was developed by the research team, coded information was derived for 698 total cases by examining documents in each subject's probation case file. Coded data from probation case files offered a baseline portrait of this sample of delinquent youth. In order to measure recidivism, the principal investigator linked baseline records, using personal and numeric identifiers, to arrest and incarceration information provided by other city and state agencies. In this dataset, each record is essentially a snapshot of a particular youth at the time of his or her disposition. Variables about the sampled youth include: demographic profile, case processing, legal history, characteristics of present and past family environments, school performance indicators, community and peer relationships, history of alcohol and drug use, mental health history, and history of victimization.",

Records were extracted for 952 adult women (age 18 and older) seeking relief from a male intimate partner by filing a civil action under North Carolina Statute Chapter 50B in Durham and Wake counties, North Carolina from February 1, 2003, to June 30, 2004, and from their male offenders. Researchers compiled data from three sources: (1) DVPO files, (2) Court Ordered Protection Evaluation (COPE) study, and (3) Criminal background checks. Variables from the DVPO files include demographic information about the plaintiff and defendant, the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, number of children under 18 in common, incident prompting the DVPO motion, DVPO conditions requested by the plaintiff, ex parte conditions granted including firearm-related restrictions, details of DVPO hearing (e.g. date, presence of attorneys), disposition of the permanent DVPO, conditions of the DVPO, if granted, and the Civil District (CVD) number for that case. Variables from the COPE study include COPE interview information regarding the women's intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences prior to filing for the DVPO (including firearm-related IPV), whether the judge inquired about firearms during the ex parte or DVPO hearings, whether the defendant possessed firearm(s) and whether he surrendered them, women's IPV experiences post-ex parte (including firearm-related IPV), and the CVD number for that case. Variables from the criminal background check include applicable charges (assault on female, communicating threats, violation of DVPO, stalking, other domestic violence related charges, firearm charges, and concealed weapon charges), the associated offense dates, and the existence and scope of other types of charges (i.e. one or more than one additional charges), and the CVD number for that case.",

The data came from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program reintroduced in 2007 (ADAM II) and its predecessor the ADAM program. ADAM data included urinalysis results that provided an objective measure of recent drug use, provided location specific estimates over time, and provided sample weights that yielded unbiased estimates for each location. The ADAM data were analyzed according to a drug epidemics framework, which has been previously employed to understand the decline of the crack epidemic, the growth of marijuana use in the 1990s, and the persistence of heroin use. Similar to other diffusion of innovation processes, drug epidemics tend to follow a natural course passing through four distinct phases: incubation, expansion, plateau, and decline. The study also searched for changes in drug markets over the course of a drug epidemic.",

The data came from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program reintroduced in 2007 (ADAM II) and its predecessor the ADAM program. ADAM data included urinalysis results that provided an objective measure of recent drug use, provided location specific estimates over time, and provided sample weights that yielded unbiased estimates for each location. The ADAM data were analyzed according to a drug epidemics framework, which has been previously employed to understand the decline of the crack epidemic, the growth of marijuana use in the 1990s, and the persistence of heroin use. Similar to other diffusion of innovation processes, drug epidemics tend to follow a natural course passing through four distinct phases: incubation, expansion, plateau, and decline. The study also searched for changes in drug markets over the course of a drug epidemic.",

The first study called for tracking cases and forensic evidence through local criminal justice processes for five offenses: homicide, sexual assault, aggravated assault, robbery and burglary. Two sites, Denver, Colorado, and San Diego, California, participated in the study. Demographic data were collected on victims (Victim Data n = 7,583) and defendants (Defendant Data n = 2,318). Data on forensic evidence collected at crime scenes included DNA material (DNA Evidence Data n = 1,894), firearms evidence (Ballistics Evidence Data n = 488), latent prints (Latent Print Evidence Data n = 766), trace evidence (Other Impressions Evidence Data n = 49), and drug evidence (Drug Evidence Data n = 43). Comparisons were then made between open and closed cases from the participating sites. Two smaller studies were conducted as part of this grant. The second study was an analysis of an experiment in the Miami-Date, Florida Police Department (Miami-Data County Data n = 1,421) to determine whether clearance rates for no-suspect property crimes could be improved through faster processing of DNA evidence. The third study was a survey of 75 police departments across the nation (Crime Labs Survey Data) to obtain information on the organizational placement, staffing and responsibilities of crime lab units.",

The first study called for tracking cases and forensic evidence through local criminal justice processes for five offenses: homicide, sexual assault, aggravated assault, robbery and burglary. Two sites, Denver, Colorado, and San Diego, California, participated in the study. Demographic data were collected on victims (Victim Data n = 7,583) and defendants (Defendant Data n = 2,318). Data on forensic evidence collected at crime scenes included DNA material (DNA Evidence Data n = 1,894), firearms evidence (Ballistics Evidence Data n = 488), latent prints (Latent Print Evidence Data n = 766), trace evidence (Other Impressions Evidence Data n = 49), and drug evidence (Drug Evidence Data n = 43). Comparisons were then made between open and closed cases from the participating sites. Two smaller studies were conducted as part of this grant. The second study was an analysis of an experiment in the Miami-Date, Florida Police Department (Miami-Data County Data n = 1,421) to determine whether clearance rates for no-suspect property crimes could be improved through faster processing of DNA evidence. The third study was a survey of 75 police departments across the nation (Crime Labs Survey Data) to obtain information on the organizational placement, staffing and responsibilities of crime lab units.",

The three programs evaluated in this study were: \r\n The Standing Against Global Exploitation Everywhere (SAGE) Project\r\nThe Salvation Army Trafficking Outreach Program and Intervention Techniques (STOP-IT) program\r\n The Streetwork Project at Safe Horizon\r\nThe goals of the evaluation were to document program implementation in the three programs, identify promising practices for service delivery programs, and inform delivery of current and future efforts by the programs to serve this population. The evaluation examined young people served by the programs, their service needs and services delivered by the programs, the experiences of young people and staff with the programs, and programs' efforts to strengthen community response to trafficked youth.",

The three programs evaluated in this study were: \r\n The Standing Against Global Exploitation Everywhere (SAGE) Project\r\nThe Salvation Army Trafficking Outreach Program and Intervention Techniques (STOP-IT) program\r\n The Streetwork Project at Safe Horizon\r\nThe goals of the evaluation were to document program implementation in the three programs, identify promising practices for service delivery programs, and inform delivery of current and future efforts by the programs to serve this population. The evaluation examined young people served by the programs, their service needs and services delivered by the programs, the experiences of young people and staff with the programs, and programs' efforts to strengthen community response to trafficked youth.",

Utilizing a randomized controlled trial design, this study tests the effectiveness of the Fourth R curriculum with seventh-grade students drawn from ten public middle schools in the Bronx, New York. A secondary quasi-experimental study seeks to examine diffusion of program impacts by comparing outcomes between students assigned to the experimental control sample and students in three comparison schools where no one received the Fourth R.\r\nThe study seeks to measure program impact on five primary and three secondary domains. Primary program impact domains include: \r\nDating violence (victimization and perpetration) \r\nSexual harassment/assault (victimization and perpetration)\r\nPeer violence/bullying (victimization and perpetration)\r\nSexual activity\r\nDrug and alcohol use\r\nSecondary outcomes, which are targeted by the Fourth R curriculum, but are not the core program focus, include:\r\nPerceived school safety\r\nPositive beliefs (e.g., anti-fighting/violence, rejection of gender stereotypes)\r\nPro-social behaviors\r\nThis study achieved their goals through student surveys, administrator and teacher interviews, and student focus groups.",

Utilizing a randomized controlled trial design, this study tests the effectiveness of the Fourth R curriculum with seventh-grade students drawn from ten public middle schools in the Bronx, New York. A secondary quasi-experimental study seeks to examine diffusion of program impacts by comparing outcomes between students assigned to the experimental control sample and students in three comparison schools where no one received the Fourth R.\r\nThe study seeks to measure program impact on five primary and three secondary domains. Primary program impact domains include: \r\nDating violence (victimization and perpetration) \r\nSexual harassment/assault (victimization and perpetration)\r\nPeer violence/bullying (victimization and perpetration)\r\nSexual activity\r\nDrug and alcohol use\r\nSecondary outcomes, which are targeted by the Fourth R curriculum, but are not the core program focus, include:\r\nPerceived school safety\r\nPositive beliefs (e.g., anti-fighting/violence, rejection of gender stereotypes)\r\nPro-social behaviors\r\nThis study achieved their goals through student surveys, administrator and teacher interviews, and student focus groups.",

-            "description": "Among divorcing and separating parents referred by family courts to mediation to resolve issues, over half report intimate partner violence (IPV). Whether family mediation can be safely offered to cases with a history of IPV is a major controversy that has not been examined previously with empirically sound research. This study was a randomized controlled trial, the \"gold standard\" for assessing interventions, of family mediation cases with levels of IPV that would, historically, be considered inappropriate for mediation at our study site, a court-attached mediation center in Washington, D.C. Study cases were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: traditional court-based litigation (n=67), shuttle mediation (n=49), or videoconferencing mediation (n=50).\r\n Researchers conducted a randomized control trial to compare immediate and one year outcomes for three dispute resolution processes (i.e., traditional court-based litigation, shuttle mediation, and videoconferencing mediation) among family law cases seeking to resolve parenting related issues and self-reporting a level of IPV history that would typically prohibit joint mediation as an option at the court-annexed mediation program where the study was conducted. \r\n The mediation intake interview included an IPV screening measure, the Mediator's Assessment of Safety Issues and Concerns (MASIC; Holtzworth-Munroe, Beck, and Applegate, 2010). There is initial evidence of the reliability and validity of the MASIC (Pokman et al., 2014) and research demonstrating that the MASIC leads to higher levels of detection of IPV among parents seeking mediation than other methods of IPV screening (Rossi, et al., 2015). The MASIC is a behaviorally specific measure, listing a series of abusive behaviors on subscales (e.g., psychological abuse, coercive control, physical violence, sexual violence, stalking) and consequences of abuse (e.g., fear of the partner, injury). Each item is assessed for occurrence twice-- ever in the relationship and in the past year. The questions ask the party about their victimization from the other party. \r\n Based on party responses to the Multi-Door intake interview, including the MASIC, the DRSs identified cases as being potentially eligible for the study if the level of IPV reported by either or both parties was at a level that the case was considered inappropriate for joint mediation. No specific level of IPV for study eligibility was set, for two reasons. First, no previous empirical data are available to guide decisions regarding what level of IPV would make joint mediation inappropriate. Second, the DRSs were well trained and experienced and wanted to retain the right to use their clinical judgment. However, the Multi-Door staff and research team agreed that DRSs would pay particular attention to level and types of IPV, presence of risk factors empirically related to lethality (e.g., weapons), whether IPV was escalating in frequency or severity, IPV-related injuries, and whether a party was fearful of the other party or expressed IPV-related concerns about participating in mediation.

Additional questions covered include the frequency of violence during the course of disputes, including experiences with physical victimization and the perpetration of violent acts was assessed.\r\nAlso elements that facilitate conflict escalation that are deemed important theoretical constructs in research on aggression, such as adverse childhood events, low self-control, negative affect, street code attitudes, routine activities/lifestyles, agreeableness, and alcohol and drug use, in addition to demographic and other person-level variables were investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\niCOR.Wave1.PRIME.sav (269 variables, 2284 cases)\r\niCOR.Wave2.PARTNER.sav (266 variables, 480 cases)\r\niCOR.Wave2.PRIME.sav (243 variables, 1629 cases)\r\niCOR.Wave3.PRIME.sav (243 variables, 1603 cases)\r\n",

The study was designed to describe the varying practices of home and other field contacts in community supervision, to document their use nationwide, and to evaluate their effectiveness in maintaining public safety and promoting compliance with supervision requirements. The research is designed to address the gap in the understanding of home and field contacts as part of community supervision.\r\nWhile home and field contacts with clients are common practice within many probation and parole agencies, little is known about how they are conducted, the goals of their use, and whether they impact client outcomes. Researchers conducted a mixed methods study of home and field contact practices within multiple agencies. A nationwide survey of community supervision agencies at the federal, state, and local levels was conducted to understand common policies and practices for home and field contacts. To analyze the effectiveness of home and field contacts, quasi-experimental designs were employed using administrative data. To understand the activities that make up home and field contacts and the goals behind them within each agency, officers\r\nwere asked to complete a qualitative home and field contact checklist and participate in focus groups.",

-            "description": "This study addressed the question of whether alternative\r\n correctional programs were more effective than traditional training\r\n schools in reducing recidivism among juvenile offenders. Alternative\r\n programs were defined as halfway homes, group homes, foster homes,\r\n ranches, camping programs, and specialized vocational programs, while\r\n training schools were defined as secure, restrictive custody programs\r\n in institutional settings. The goal of this study was to assess the\r\n impact of alternative program placements versus training school for a\r\n 12-year period on 266 juvenile delinquents remanded to youth\r\n facilities in a southwestern state in 1983. Subjects chosen for the\r\n study were 298 youth who had been committed by a county court to a\r\n statewide juvenile corrections program between January 1, 1983, and\r\n July 1, 1983. The sample was representative of the youth commission's\r\n population of juvenile offenders in terms of age, race, and sex. All\r\n were first time commitments, and the original commitment offense for a\r\n majority of the youth was a nonviolent property crime, such as\r\n burglary or theft. From this original sample, 32 juveniles were\r\n eliminated from the study because they were not adequately exposed to\r\n either an institutional or alternative program. The final sample\r\n consisted of 266 juvenile offenders, of which 164 were placed in\r\n institutions and 102 were placed in alternative programs. Youth were\r\n not randomly assigned to programs. Juveniles with particular\r\n characteristics were automatically assigned to certain types of\r\n programs. All violent offenders were placed in institutions. The study\r\n was designed to include a lengthy follow-up period, a focus on subject\r\n by program interaction effects, and the use of survival analysis to\r\n examine the timing of recidivism as well as its incidence. Recidivism\r\n was defined as the first arrest or parole revocation that took place\r\n within the follow-up period. The follow-up period was approximately 12\r\n years, from the parole assignment until September 1, 1995. Data were\r\n collected primarily from the administrative records of the state youth\r\n commission. The commission also obtained additional follow-up data\r\n from the state Department of Public Safety and the state Department of\r\n Corrections. Additionally, family background data were collected from\r\n each youth's parole officer in response to a survey conducted\r\n specifically for this study in September 1994. Demographic variables\r\n include commitment age, race, and sex. Psychosocial variables include\r\n family environment and IQ. Other independent variables include\r\n program placement status, delinquency risk scales, and program\r\n adjustment measures. The dependent variable is recidivism, measured as\r\n both a discrete variable indicating whether an arrest occurred and\r\ntime until first arrest offense after parole.",

-            "description": "The Reintegrative Shaming Experiments (RISE) project\r\ncompared the effects of standard court processing with the effects of\r\na restorative justice intervention known as conferencing for four\r\nkinds of cases: drunk driving (over .08 blood alcohol content) at any\r\nage, juvenile property offending with personal victims, juvenile\r\nshoplifting offenses detected by store security officers, and youth\r\nviolent crimes (under age 30). Reintegrative shaming theory underpins\r\nthe conferencing alternative. It entails offenders facing those harmed\r\nby their actions in the presence of family and friends whose opinions\r\nthey care about, discussing their wrongdoing, and making repayment to\r\nsociety and to their victims for the costs of their crimes, both\r\nmaterial and emotional. These conferences were facilitated by police\r\nofficers and usually took around 90 minutes, compared with around ten\r\nminutes for court processing time. The researchers sought to test the\r\nhypotheses that (1) there would be less repeat offending after a\r\nconference than after a court treatment, (2) victims would be more\r\nsatisfied with conferences than with court, (3) both offenders and\r\nvictims would find conferences to be fairer than court, and (4) the\r\npublic costs of providing a conference would be no greater than, and\r\nperhaps less than, the costs of processing offenders in court. This\r\nstudy contains data from ongoing experiments comparing the effects of\r\ncourt versus diversionary conferences for a select group of\r\noffenders. Part 1, Administrative Data for All Cases, consists of data\r\nfrom reports by police officers. These data include information on the\r\noffender's attitude, the police station and officer that referred the\r\ncase, blood alcohol content level (drunk driving only), offense type,\r\nand RISE assigned treatment. Parts 2-5 are data from observations by\r\ntrained RISE research staff of court and conference treatments to\r\nwhich offenders had been randomly assigned. Variables for Parts 2-5\r\ninclude duration of the court or conference, if there was any violence\r\nor threat of violence in the court or conference, supports that the\r\noffender and victim had, how much reintegrative shaming was expressed,\r\nthe extent to which the offender accepted guilt, if and in what form\r\nthe offender apologized (e.g., verbal, handshake, hug, kiss), how\r\ndefiant or sullen the offender was, how much the offender contributed\r\nto the outcome, what the outcome was (e.g., dismissed, imprisonment,\r\nfine, community service, bail release, driving license cancelled,\r\ncounseling program), and what the outcome reflected (punishment,\r\nrepaying community, repaying victims, preventing future offense,\r\nrestoration). Data for Parts 6 and 7, Year 0 Survey Data from\r\nNon-Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and Conferences and Year\r\n0 Survey Data from Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and\r\nConferences, were taken from interviews with offenders by trained RISE\r\ninterview staff after the court or conference proceedings. Variables\r\nfor Parts 6 and 7 include how much the court or conference respected\r\nthe respondent's rights, how much influence the respondent had over\r\nthe agreement, the outcome that the respondent received, if the court\r\nor conference solved any problems, if police explained that the\r\nrespondent had the right to refuse the court or conference, if the\r\nrespondent was consulted about whom to invite to court or conference,\r\nhow the respondent was treated, and if the respondent's respect for\r\nthe justice system had gone up or down as a result of the court or\r\nconference. Additional variables focused on how nervous the respondent\r\nwas about attending the court or conference, how severe the respondent\r\nfelt the outcome was, how severe the respondent thought the punishment\r\nwould be if he/she were caught again, if the respondent thought the\r\ncourt or conference would prevent him/her from breaking the law, if\r\nthe respondent was bitter about the way he/she was treated, if the\r\nrespondent understood what was going on in the court or conference, if\r\nthe court or conference took account of what the respondent said, if\r\nthe respondent felt pushed around by people with more power, if the\r\nrespondent felt disadvantaged because of race, sex, age, or income,\r\nhow police treated the respondent when arrested, if the respondent\r\nregretted what he/she did, if the respondent felt ashamed of what\r\nhe/she did, what his/her family, friends, and other people thought of\r\nwhat the respondent did, and if the respondent had used drugs or\r\nalcohol the past year. Demographic variables in this data collection\r\ninclude offender's country of birth, gender, race, education, income,\r\nand employment.",

Reintegrative shaming theory underpins\r\nthe conferencing alternative. It entails offenders facing those harmed\r\nby their actions in the presence of family and friends whose opinions\r\nthey care about, discussing their wrongdoing, and making repayment to\r\nsociety and to their victims for the costs of their crimes, both\r\nmaterial and emotional. These conferences were facilitated by police\r\nofficers and usually took around 90 minutes, compared with around ten\r\nminutes for court processing time. The researchers sought to test the\r\nhypotheses that (1) there would be less repeat offending after a\r\nconference than after a court treatment, (2) victims would be more\r\nsatisfied with conferences than with court, (3) both offenders and\r\nvictims would find conferences to be fairer than court, and (4) the\r\npublic costs of providing a conference would be no greater than, and\r\nperhaps less than, the costs of processing offenders in court. This\r\nstudy contains data from ongoing experiments comparing the effects of\r\ncourt versus diversionary conferences for a select group of\r\noffenders. Part 1, Administrative Data for All Cases, consists of data\r\nfrom reports by police officers. These data include information on the\r\noffender's attitude, the police station and officer that referred the\r\ncase, blood alcohol content level (drunk driving only), offense type,\r\nand RISE assigned treatment. Parts 2-5 are data from observations by\r\ntrained RISE research staff of court and conference treatments to\r\nwhich offenders had been randomly assigned. Variables for Parts 2-5\r\ninclude duration of the court or conference, if there was any violence\r\nor threat of violence in the court or conference, supports that the\r\noffender and victim had, how much reintegrative shaming was expressed,\r\nthe extent to which the offender accepted guilt, if and in what form\r\nthe offender apologized (e.g., verbal, handshake, hug, kiss), how\r\ndefiant or sullen the offender was, how much the offender contributed\r\nto the outcome, what the outcome was (e.g., dismissed, imprisonment,\r\nfine, community service, bail release, driving license cancelled,\r\ncounseling program), and what the outcome reflected (punishment,\r\nrepaying community, repaying victims, preventing future offense,\r\nrestoration). Data for Parts 6 and 7, Year 0 Survey Data from\r\nNon-Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and Conferences and Year\r\n0 Survey Data from Drunk-Driving Offenders Assigned to Court and\r\nConferences, were taken from interviews with offenders by trained RISE\r\ninterview staff after the court or conference proceedings. Variables\r\nfor Parts 6 and 7 include how much the court or conference respected\r\nthe respondent's rights, how much influence the respondent had over\r\nthe agreement, the outcome that the respondent received, if the court\r\nor conference solved any problems, if police explained that the\r\nrespondent had the right to refuse the court or conference, if the\r\nrespondent was consulted about whom to invite to court or conference,\r\nhow the respondent was treated, and if the respondent's respect for\r\nthe justice system had gone up or down as a result of the court or\r\nconference.

Data were collected to draw\r\ncomparisons between abused women in situations resulting in fatal\r\noutcomes and those without fatal outcomes, as well as a baseline\r\ncomparison of abused women and non-abused women, taking into account\r\nthe interaction of events, circumstances, and interventions occurring\r\nover the course of a year or two. The CWHRS used a quasi-experimental\r\ndesign to gather survey data on 705 women at the point of service for\r\nany kind of treatment (related to abuse or not) sought at one of four\r\nmedical sites serving populations in areas with high rates of intimate\r\npartner homicide (Chicago Women's Health Center, Cook County Hospital,\r\nErie Family Health Center, and Roseland Public Health Center). Over\r\n2,600 women were randomly screened in these settings, following strict\r\nprotocols for safety and privacy. One goal of the design was that the\r\nsample would not systematically exclude high-risk but understudied\r\npopulations, such as expectant mothers, women without regular sources\r\nof health care, and abused women in situations where the abuse is\r\nunknown to helping agencies. To accomplish this, the study used\r\nsensitive contact and interview procedures, developed sensitive\r\ninstruments, and worked closely with each sample site. The CWHRS\r\nattempted to interview all women who answered \"yes -- within the past\r\nyear\" to any of the three screening questions, and about 30 percent of\r\nwomen who did not answer yes, provided that the women were over age 17\r\nand had been in an intimate relationship in the past year. In total,\r\n705 women were interviewed, 497 of whom reported that they had\r\nexperienced physical violence or a violent threat at the hands of an\r\nintimate partner in the past year (the abused, or AW, group). The\r\nremaining 208 women formed the comparison group (the non-abused, or\r\nNAW, group). Data from the initial interview sections comprise Parts\r\n1-8. For some women, the AW versus NAW interview status was not the\r\nsame as their screening status. When a woman told the interviewer that\r\nshe had experienced violence or a violent threat in the past year, she\r\nand the interviewer completed a daily calendar history, including\r\ndetails of important events and each violent incident that had\r\noccurred the previous year. The study attempted to conduct one or two\r\nfollow-up interviews over the following year with the 497 women\r\ncategorized as AW. The follow-up rate was 66 percent. Data from this\r\npart of the clinic/hospital sample are found in Parts 9-12. In\r\naddition to the clinic/hospital sample, the CWHRS collected data on\r\neach of the 87 intimate partner homicides occurring in Chicago over a\r\ntwo-year period that involved at least one woman age 18 or\r\nolder. Using the same interview schedule as for the clinic/hospital\r\nsample, CWHRS interviewers conducted personal interviews with one to\r\nthree \"proxy respondents\" per case, people who were knowledgeable and\r\ncredible sources of information about the couple and their\r\nrelationship, and information was compiled from official or public\r\nrecords, such as court records, witness statements, and newspaper\r\naccounts (Parts 13-15). In homicides in which a woman was the homicide\r\noffender, attempts were made to contact and interview her. This\r\n\"lethal\" sample, all such homicides that took place in 1995 or 1996,\r\nwas developed from two sources, HOMICIDES IN CHICAGO, 1965-1995 (ICPSR\r\n6399) and the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Part 1 includes\r\ndemographic variables describing each respondent, such as age, race\r\nand ethnicity, level of education, employment status, screening status\r\n(AW or NAW), birthplace, and marital status. Variables in Part 2\r\ninclude details about the woman's household, such as whether she was\r\nhomeless, the number of people living in the household and details\r\nabout each person, the number of her children or other children in the\r\nhousehold, details of any of her children not living in her household,\r\nand any changes in the household structure over the past\r\nyear. Variables in Part 3 deal with the woman's physical and mental\r\nhealth, including pregnancy, and with her social support network and\r\nmaterial resources. Variables in Part 4 provide information on the\r\nnumber and type of firearms in the household, whether the woman had\r\nexperienced power, control, stalking, or harassment at the hands of an\r\nintimate partner in the past year, whether she had experienced\r\nspecific types of violence or violent threats at the hands of an\r\nintimate partner in the past year, and whether she had experienced\r\nsymptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to the incidents in\r\nthe past month. Variables in Part 5 specify the partner or partners\r\nwho were responsible for the incidents in the past year, record the\r\ntype and length of the woman's relationship with each of these\r\npartners, and provide detailed information on the one partner she\r\nchose to talk about (called \"Name\"). Variables in Part 6 probe the\r\nwoman's help-seeking and interventions in the past year. Variables in\r\nPart 7 include questions comprising the Campbell Danger Assessment\r\n(Campbell, 1993). Part 8 assembles variables pertaining to the chosen\r\nabusive partner (Name). Part 9, an event-level file, includes the type\r\nand the date of each event the woman discussed in a 12-month\r\nretrospective calendar history. Part 10, an incident-level file,\r\nincludes variables describing each violent incident or threat of\r\nviolence. There is a unique identifier linking each woman to her set\r\nof events or incidents. Part 11 is a person-level file in which the\r\nincidents in Part 10 have been aggregated into totals for each\r\nwoman. Variables in Part 11 include, for example, the total number of\r\nincidents during the year, the number of days before the interview\r\nthat the most recent incident had occurred, and the severity of the\r\nmost severe incident in the past year. Part 12 is a person-level file\r\nthat summarizes incident information from the follow-up interviews,\r\nincluding the number of abuse incidents from the initial interview to\r\nthe last follow-up, the number of days between the initial interview\r\nand the last follow-up, and the maximum severity of any follow-up\r\nincident. Parts 1-12 contain a unique identifier variable that allows\r\nusers to link each respondent across files. Parts 13-15 contain data\r\nfrom official records sources and information supplied by proxies for\r\nvictims of intimate partner homicides in 1995 and 1996 in\r\nChicago. Part 13 contains information about the homicide incidents\r\nfrom the \"lethal sample,\" along with outcomes of the court cases (if\r\nany) from the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts. Variables\r\nfor Part 13 include the number of victims killed in the incident, the\r\nmonth and year of the incident, the gender, race, and age of both the\r\nvictim and offender, who initiated the violence, the severity of any\r\nother violence immediately preceding the death, if leaving the\r\nrelationship triggered the final incident, whether either partner was\r\ninvading the other's home at the time of the incident, whether\r\njealousy or infidelity was an issue in the final incident, whether\r\nthere was drug or alcohol use noted by witnesses, the predominant\r\nmotive of the homicide, location of the homicide, relationship of\r\nvictim to offender, type of weapon used, whether the offender\r\ncommitted suicide after the homicide, whether any criminal charges\r\nwere filed, and the type of disposition and length of sentence for\r\nthat charge. Parts 14 and 15 contain data collected using the proxy\r\ninterview questionnaire (or the interview of the woman offender, if\r\napplicable). The questionnaire used for Part 14 was identical to the\r\none used in the clinic sample, except for some extra questions about\r\nthe homicide incident. The data include only those 76 cases for which\r\nat least one interview was conducted. Most variables in Part 14\r\npertain to the victim or the offender, regardless of gender (unless\r\notherwise labeled). For ease of analysis, Part 15 includes the same 76\r\ncases as Part 14, but the variables are organized from the woman's\r\npoint of view, regardless of whether she was the victim or offender in\r\nthe homicide (for the same-sex cases, Part 15 is from the woman\r\nvictim's point of view). Parts 14 and 15 can be linked by ID\r\nnumber. However, Part 14 includes five sets of variables that were\r\nasked only from the woman's perspective in the original questionnaire:\r\nhousehold composition, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), social\r\nsupport network, personal income (as opposed to household income), and\r\nhelp-seeking and intervention. To avoid redundancy, these variables\r\nappear only in Part 14. Other variables in Part 14 cover information\r\nabout the person(s) interviewed, the victim's and offender's age, sex,\r\nrace/ethnicity, birthplace, employment status at time of death, and\r\nlevel of education, a scale of the victim's and offender's severity of\r\nphysical abuse in the year prior to the death, the length of the\r\nrelationship between victim and offender, the number of children\r\nbelonging to each partner, whether either partner tried to leave\r\nand/or asked the other to stay away, the reasons why each partner\r\ntried to leave, the longest amount of time each partner stayed away,\r\nwhether either or both partners returned to the relationship before\r\nthe death, any known physical or emotional problems sustained by\r\nvictim or offender, including the four-item Medical Outcomes Study\r\n(MOS) scale of depression, drug and alcohol use of the victim and\r\noffender, number and type of guns in the household of the victim and\r\noffender, Scales of Power and Control (Johnson, 1996) or Stalking and\r\nHarassment (Sheridan, 1992) by either intimate partner in the year\r\nprior to the death, a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale\r\n(CTS) (Johnson, 1996) measuring the type of physical violence\r\nexperienced by either intimate partner, and the Campbell Danger\r\nAssessment for the victim and offender. In addition, Part 14 contains\r\na number of summary variables about the fatal incident, most of which\r\nare also in Part 13. These include questions related to the\r\ncircumstances of the incident, time, place, witnesses, who had\r\ninitiated the violence, outcome for the offender (e.g., suicide or\r\nother death, arrest, sentence, etc.), and outcome for children and\r\nothers who witnessed the violence or found the body. Part 15 contains\r\nthe same data as Part 14, except that each variable is presented from\r\nthe woman's point of view, regardless of whether she was the victim or\r\noffender in the homicide. Additional summary variables were added\r\nregarding the overall nature of any prior physical abuse in the\r\nrelationship, as well as the overall pattern of leaving and returning\r\nto the relationship in the year prior to the death.",

For ease of analysis, Part 15 includes the same 76\r\ncases as Part 14, but the variables are organized from the woman's\r\npoint of view, regardless of whether she was the victim or offender in\r\nthe homicide (for the same-sex cases, Part 15 is from the woman\r\nvictim's point of view). Parts 14 and 15 can be linked by ID\r\nnumber. However, Part 14 includes five sets of variables that were\r\nasked only from the woman's perspective in the original questionnaire:\r\nhousehold composition, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), social\r\nsupport network, personal income (as opposed to household income), and\r\nhelp-seeking and intervention. To avoid redundancy, these variables\r\nappear only in Part 14. Other variables in Part 14 cover information\r\nabout the person(s) interviewed, the victim's and offender's age, sex,\r\nrace/ethnicity, birthplace, employment status at time of death, and\r\nlevel of education, a scale of the victim's and offender's severity of\r\nphysical abuse in the year prior to the death, the length of the\r\nrelationship between victim and offender, the number of children\r\nbelonging to each partner, whether either partner tried to leave\r\nand/or asked the other to stay away, the reasons why each partner\r\ntried to leave, the longest amount of time each partner stayed away,\r\nwhether either or both partners returned to the relationship before\r\nthe death, any known physical or emotional problems sustained by\r\nvictim or offender, including the four-item Medical Outcomes Study\r\n(MOS) scale of depression, drug and alcohol use of the victim and\r\noffender, number and type of guns in the household of the victim and\r\noffender, Scales of Power and Control (Johnson, 1996) or Stalking and\r\nHarassment (Sheridan, 1992) by either intimate partner in the year\r\nprior to the death, a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale\r\n(CTS) (Johnson, 1996) measuring the type of physical violence\r\nexperienced by either intimate partner, and the Campbell Danger\r\nAssessment for the victim and offender. In addition, Part 14 contains\r\na number of summary variables about the fatal incident, most of which\r\nare also in Part 13. These include questions related to the\r\ncircumstances of the incident, time, place, witnesses, who had\r\ninitiated the violence, outcome for the offender (e.g., suicide or\r\nother death, arrest, sentence, etc.), and outcome for children and\r\nothers who witnessed the violence or found the body. Part 15 contains\r\nthe same data as Part 14, except that each variable is presented from\r\nthe woman's point of view, regardless of whether she was the victim or\r\noffender in the homicide. Additional summary variables were added\r\nregarding the overall nature of any prior physical abuse in the\r\nrelationship, as well as the overall pattern of leaving and returning\r\nto the relationship in the year prior to the death.",

The\r\nresearchers sought to examine factors that influence court officials'\r\ndecision-making in domestic violence cases, as well as factors that\r\ninfluence victim and witness reluctance in bringing batterers to\r\nsuccessful adjudication. In Part 1 researchers merged pretrial\r\nservices data with information from police and prosecutors' reports in\r\nthe urban area under study to answer the following questions: (1) What\r\nis the rate of dismissals, acquittals, and convictions for misdemeanor\r\ncourt cases and what are the conditions of these sentences? (2) What\r\nfactors in court cases are significantly related to whether the\r\ndisposition is a dismissal, acquittal, or conviction, and how are\r\nthese cases processed? In Part 2, judges, prosecutors, and public\r\ndefenders were asked detailed questions about their level of knowledge\r\nabout, attitudes toward, and self-reported behaviors regarding the\r\nprocessing of domestic violence cases to find out: (1) What roles do\r\nlegal and extra-legal factors play in decision-makers' self-reported\r\nbehaviors and attitudes? (2) How do decision-makers rate victim\r\nadvocate and batterer treatment programs? (3) How do court\r\nprofessionals view the victim's role in the court process? and (4) To\r\nwhat degree do court professionals report victim-blaming attitudes and\r\nexperiences? For Part 3 researchers used a stratified random sample to\r\nselect court cases of misdemeanor domestic violence that would be\r\ntranscribed and used for a content analysis to examine: (1) Who speaks\r\nin court and how? and (2) What is considered relevant by different\r\ncourt players? In Parts 4-103 victim surveys and interviews were\r\nadministered to learn about battered women's experiences in both their\r\npersonal lives and the criminal processing system. Researchers sought\r\nto answer the following questions: (1) How do victim/witnesses\r\nperceive their role in the prosecution of their abusers? (2) What\r\nfactors inhibit them from pursuing prosecution? (3) What factors might\r\nhelp them pursue prosecution? and (4) How consistent are the\r\nvictims'/witnesses' demographic and psychological profiles with\r\nexisting research in this area? Domestic violence victims attending\r\narraignment between January 1 and December 31 of 1997 were asked to\r\ncomplete surveys to identify their concerns about testifying against\r\ntheir partners and to evaluate the effectiveness of the court system\r\nin dealing with domestic violence cases (Part 4). The disposition of\r\neach case was subsequently determined by a research team member's\r\nexamination of defendants' case files and/or court computer\r\nfiles. Upon case closure victims who had both completed a survey and\r\nindicated a willingness to be interviewed were contacted to\r\nparticipate in an interview (Parts 5-103). Variables in Part 1,\r\nPretrial Services Data, include prior criminal history, current\r\ncharges, case disposition, sentence, victim testimony, police\r\ntestimony, victim's demeanor at trial, judge's conduct, type of abuse\r\ninvolved, weapons used, injuries sustained, and type of evidence\r\navailable for trial. Demographic variables include age, sex, and race\r\nof defendants, victims, prosecutors, and judges. In Part 2,\r\nProfessional Survey Data, respondents were asked about their tolerance\r\nfor victims and offenders who appeared in court more than once,\r\nactions taken when substance abuse was involved, the importance of\r\ninjuries in making a decision, attitudes toward battered women, the\r\nrole of victim advocates and the police, views on restraining orders,\r\nand opinion on whether arrest is a deterrent. Demographic variables\r\ninclude age, sex, race, marital status, and years of professional\r\nexperience. Variables in Part 3, Court Transcript Data, include number\r\nand type of charges, pleas, reasons for dismissals, types of evidence\r\nsubmitted by prosecutors and defense, substance abuse by victim and\r\ndefendant, living arrangements and number of children of victim and\r\ndefendant, specific type of abuse, injuries sustained, witnesses to\r\ninjuries, police testimony, verdict, and sentence. Demographic\r\nvariables include age and sex of defendant and victim and relationship\r\nof victim and defendant. In Part 4, Victim Survey Data, victims were\r\nasked about their relationship and living arrangements with the\r\ndefendant, concerns about testifying in court, desired outcomes of\r\ncase and punishment for defendant, emotional issues related to abuse,\r\nhealth problems, substance abuse, support networks, other violent\r\ndomestic incidents and injuries, and safety concerns. Part 5 variables\r\nmeasured victims' safety at different stages of the criminal justice\r\nprocess and danger experienced due to further violent incidents,\r\npresence of weapons, and threats of homicide or suicide.

Inmates are referred to this program if\r\nthey have an identified need for residential-level substance abuse\r\ntreatment and are within 12 months of release consideration. TOW is a\r\nvoluntary, six-month long program that works with inmates to identify\r\nthe causes of their addictive behaviors and encourage changes in\r\nunacceptable behaviors and criminal thinking. The sample for this study\r\nconsists of adult male inmates at the Clarinda Correctional Facility\r\nbetween January 1998 and March 1999. The first point of data collection\r\nwas the intake assessment. At intake, each subject completed an intake\r\npacket consisting of several instruments that measured variables\r\nrelevant to TOW program goals. Each inmate was also given an Addiction\r\nSeverity Index (ASI) interview by a counselor at intake. Upon discharge\r\nfrom the program, each subject completed a discharge packet, which\r\ncontained instruments slightly different from those in the intake\r\npacket. Instruments were chosen for reliability and validity, ease of\r\nadministration, potential for dual clinical and evaluation use, and\r\nwhether they duplicated any existing efforts. Versions of the following\r\ninstruments were included in both the intake and discharge packets: the\r\nColorado Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire, Circumstances, Motivation,\r\nand Readiness (CMR) Scales for Substance Abuse Treatment, the Social\r\nProvisions Scale (SPS), the Self-Help Questionnaire, and the STEPS\r\nQuestionnaire. A consumer satisfaction survey was also administered at\r\nthe discharge interview. Variables obtained from answers to the ASI\r\ninclude gender, living situation, date of birth, race, religion, length\r\nof incarceration, medical status, education and employment history,\r\nsources of financial support, family/social relationships including\r\nabuse history, psychiatric status, drug and alcohol use including kinds\r\nof drugs used, length of use, age at first use, and frequency of use for\r\neach drug, personal problems caused by drug use, drug treatment history,\r\nlegal history, and family history of drug, alcohol, and psychological\r\nproblems. Intake assessment variables included are related to social\r\nattitudes, and include variables on life goals and the subjects' own\r\nviews of their achievability, how subjects thought their friends viewed\r\nthem, how wrong subjects thought certain illegal acts were, and\r\ncriminal acts by the subjects' friends in the past six months. Discharge\r\npacket variables include the same variables on social attitudes as the\r\nintake packet as well as variables obtained from answers to the SPS\r\nrelating to the amount of social support subjects felt they had, past\r\ninvolvement with self-help groups, and life attitudes related to\r\ndrug/alcohol use.",

Other variables include whether the\r\n notification level was decided by the Core Notification Team,\r\n difficulties the respondent had with Special Bulletin Notification\r\n (SBN) offenders assigned to his/her caseload, if the respondent's\r\n field unit utilized SO-ISP or \"high risk\" agent teams to manage sex\r\n offenders, which individuals worked with the respondent's team, the\r\n type of caseload the respondent supervised, the number of sex\r\n offenders on the respondent's caseload, if the respondent used a\r\n special risk assessment or classification instrument for sex\r\n offenders, other information used to determine the supervision level\r\n for a sex offender, if child sex offenders were managed differently\r\n than other sex offenders, how often a polygraph was used on sex\r\n offenders, who paid for the polygraph, who chose the treatment\r\n provider, the number of supervision contacts with high-risk, SBN, or\r\n medium-risk sex offenders per week, victim policies and procedures\r\n used, rules or policies regarding revocation, and prerevocation\r\nsanctions used.",

Advocacy was defined as those services\r\n provided to support victims during the legal process or to enhance\r\n their safety. For the Preliminary Complaint Reports Data (Part 1), a\r\n random sample of preliminary complaint reports (PCRs), completed by\r\n police officers after they responded to domestic violence calls, were\r\n gathered, resulting in a sample of 1,057 incidents and victims. For\r\n Victim Advocacy Contact Data (Part 2), researchers obtained data from\r\n advocates' files about the services they provided to the 1,057\r\n victims. For Case Disposition Data (Part 3), researchers conducted a\r\n computer search to determine the outcomes of the cases. They looked up\r\n each perpetrator from the list of 1,057 incidents, and determined\r\n whether there was a warrant for the focal incident, whether it turned\r\n into a prosecution, and the outcome. The Initial Victim Interview\r\n (Part 4) and Follow-Up Victim Interview Data (Part 5) were conducted\r\n from April 1998 to July 1999. During the same period that researchers\r\n were completing the second interviews, they also interviewed 23 women\r\n (Victim Comparison Group Interview Data, Part 6) from the list of\r\n 1,057 whom they had been unable to reach during the first interviews.\r\n They compared these 23 women to the 63 who had second interviews to\r\n determine if there were any differences in use of services, or views\r\n toward or participation in prosecution. Variables in Part 1 focus on\r\n whether alcohol and abuse were involved, previous incidents, the\r\n suspect's psychological aggressions and physical assaults, if a weapon\r\n was used, if the victim was hurt, if property was damaged, if the\r\n victim sought medical attention, and the severity of physical abuse or\r\n injury. Variables in Part 2 provide information on the role of the\r\n advocate, methods of contact, types of referrals made, and services\r\n provided. Variables in Part 3 include the type of charge, outcome of\r\n resolved case, why the case was dismissed, if applicable, and if the\r\n suspect was sentenced to probation, costs, confinement, no contact\r\n with the victim, a batterer program, or community service. The\r\n initial, follow-up, and comparison group interviews (Parts 4-6) all\r\n collected similar information. Variables about the incident include\r\n how well the respondent remembered the incident, if police arrived\r\n promptly, if the respondent was advised to file charges, if police\r\n told the respondent that a counselor was available, and if the\r\n respondent's partner had been in jail since the incident. Variables\r\n concerning advocacy include whether the victim contacted advocates,\r\n and if advocates provided legal help and referrals. Legal system\r\n variables include whether the respondent felt pressured by anyone to\r\n drop charges or pursue charges, if the respondent received help for\r\n preliminary examination or trial, and if contact with the legal system\r\n helped the respondent. Variables about services include whether the\r\n respondent received assistance in temporary shelter, food/money\r\n resources, child care, employment, education, a lawyer for\r\n divorce/custody, support or self-help group, or a substance abuse\r\n treatment program. Variables concerning what happened in the previous\r\n six months cover the number of times the respondent had called police\r\n because of danger, left home because of a violent incident, partner\r\n had been arrested because of violence, and partner physically abused\r\n respondent. Variables about events that occurred while the respondent\r\n and abuser were separated include how often the partner harassed the\r\n respondent on the phone, wrote threatening letters, violated legal\r\n restrictions, refused to leave the respondent's home, failed to pay\r\n child support, and threatened to take the children. Demographic\r\n variables include respondent's race or ethnic background, education,\r\n marital status, number of children, number of children who lived with\r\n respondent, and employment status and income at the time of the\r\ninterviews.",

The following objectives were set to achieve this goal:\r\n(1) to develop a standardized interview instrument to be used by all\r\nemergency shelters for battered women in the region, and (2) to\r\nconduct interviews with shelter staff. For this study, the San Diego\r\nAssociation of Governments (SANDAG) collected information about\r\ndomestic violence in San Diego County from clients admitted to\r\nbattered women's shelters. The Compilation of Research and Evaluation\r\n(CORE) intake interview (Part 1) was initiated in March of\r\n1997. Through this interview, researchers gathered data over a\r\n22-month period, through December 1998, for 599 clients. The CORE\r\ndischarge interview (Part 2) was theoretically completed at the time\r\nof exit with each client who completed the CORE intake interview in\r\norder to document the services received. However, data collection at\r\nexit was not reliable, due to factors beyond the researchers' control,\r\nand thus researchers did not receive a discharge form for each\r\nindividual who had an intake form. For Part 1 (Intake Data),\r\ndemographic variables include the client's primary language, and the\r\nclient and batterer's age, education, race, how they supported\r\nthemselves, their annual incomes, and their children's sex, age, and\r\nethnicity. Other variables cover whether the client had been to this\r\nshelter within the last 12 months, the kind of housing the client had\r\nbefore she came to the shelter, person's  admitted along with\r\nthe client, drug and alcohol use by the client, the batterer, and the\r\nchildren, relationship between the client and the batterer (e.g.,\r\nspouse, former spouse), if the client and batterer had been in the\r\nmilitary, if the client or children were military dependents, the\r\nclient's citizenship, if the client and batterer had any\r\nphysical/mental limitations, abuse characteristics (e.g., physical,\r\nverbal, sexual, weapon involved), and the client's medical treatment\r\nhistory (e.g., went to hospital, had been abused while pregnant,\r\nwitnessed abuse while growing up, had been involved in other abusive\r\nrelationships, had attempted suicide).  Additional variables provide\r\nlegal information (number of times police had been called to the\r\nclient's household as a result of domestic violence, if anyone in the\r\nhousehold had been arrested as a result of those calls, if any charges\r\nwere filed, if the client or batterer had been convicted of abuse), if\r\nthe client had a restraining order against the batterer, how the\r\nclient found out about the shelter, the number of times the client had\r\nbeen admitted to a domestic violence shelter, the client's assessment\r\nof her needs at the time of admittance, and the\r\ninterviewer/counselor's assessment of the client's needs at the time\r\nof admittance. Part 2 (Discharge Data) provides information on\r\nservices the client received from the shelter during her stay (food,\r\nclothing, permanent housing, transitional housing, financial\r\nassistance, employment, education, medical help, assistance with\r\nretrieving belongings, assistance with retrieving/replacing legal\r\ndocuments, law enforcement, temporary restraining order), and\r\nservices this client received as a referral to another agency\r\n(attorney, divorce, child care, counseling, transportation, safety\r\nplan, victim/witness funds, mental health services, department of\r\nsocial services, Children's Services Bureau, help with immigration,\r\ndrug treatment).",

In order to evaluate the implementation of the\r\n specialized domestic violence unit, the researchers conducted the\r\n following tasks: (1) They surveyed field deputies to assess their\r\n level of knowledge about domestic violence laws and adherence to the\r\n countywide domestic violence protocol. (2) They studied a sample from\r\n the case tracking system that reported cases of domestic violence\r\n handled by the domestic violence unit to determine changes in\r\n procedures compared to an earlier case tracking study with no\r\n specialized unit. (3) They interviewed victims of domestic violence by\r\n phone to explore the responsiveness of the field deputies and the unit\r\n detectives to the needs of the victims. Part 1 (Deputy Survey Data)\r\n contains data on unit detectives' knowledge about the laws concerning\r\n domestic violence. Information includes whether or not the person\r\n considered the primary aggressor was the person who committed the\r\n first act of aggression, if a law enforcement officer could decide\r\n whether or not to complete a domestic violence supplemental report,\r\n whether an arrest should be made if there was reasonable cause to\r\n believe that a misdemeanor offense had been committed, and whether the\r\n decision to prosecute a suspect lay within the discretion of the\r\n district or city attorney. Demographic variables include deputy's\r\n years of education and law enforcement experience. Part 2 (Case\r\n Tracking Data) includes demographic variables such as race and sex of\r\n the victim and the suspect, and the relationship between the victim\r\n and the suspect. Other information was collected on whether the victim\r\n and the suspect used alcohol and drugs prior to or during the\r\n incident, if the victim was pregnant, if children were present during\r\n the incident, highest charge on the incident report, if the reporting\r\n call was made at the same place the incident occurred, suspect actions\r\n described on the report, if a gun, knife, physical force, or verbal\r\n abuse was used in the incident, if the victim or the suspect was\r\n injured, and if medical treatment was provided to the victim. Data\r\n were also gathered on whether the suspect was arrested or booked, how\r\n the investigating officer decided whether to request that the\r\n prosecutor file charges, type of evidence collected, if a victim or\r\n witness statement was collected, if the victim had a restraining\r\n order, prior history of domestic violence, if the victim was provided\r\n with information on domestic violence law, hotline, shelter,\r\n transportation, and medical treatment, highest arrest charge, number\r\n of arrests for any drug charges, weapon charges, domestic violence\r\n charges, or other charges, case disposition, number of convictions for\r\n the charges, and number of prior arrests and convictions. Part 3\r\n (Victim Survey Data) includes demographic variables such as victim's\r\n gender and race.

Intensive evaluations were done at six CCP sites: Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Columbia, South Carolina; Fort Worth, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Seattle, Washington. Less intensive evaluations were done at six other CCP sites: Gary, Indiana; Hartford, Connecticut; Wichita, Kansas; the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area; the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area; and the East Bay area of northern California. At all 12 sites, 2 waves of a Coalition Survey (Parts 1 and 2) were sent to everyone who participated in CCP. Likewise, 2 waves of the Community Policing Survey (Parts 3 and 4) were sent to the police chiefs of all 12 sites. Finally, all 12 sites were visited by researchers at least once (Parts 5 to 13). Variables found in this data collection include problems facing the communities, the implementation of CCP programs, the use of community policing, and the effectiveness of the CCP programs and community policing efforts.",

-            "description": "This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the\r\nstructured substance abuse treatment program at Barrett Juvenile\r\nCorrection Center in Virginia by comparing the outcomes of youth\r\nadmitted to Barrett with the outcomes of youth who were eligible for\r\nadmittance to Barrett but were detained at one of the traditional\r\njuvenile correctional centers in Virginia. The effectiveness of\r\nBarrett's program was also assessed by comparing the outcomes of youth\r\nwho were admitted to Barrett but who differed according to how many of\r\nthe four phases of treatment, focused on modifying negative attitudes\r\nand behaviors, they completed. Barrett differs from the six other\r\njuvenile correctional centers in Virginia in that it provides a highly\r\nstructured substance abuse treatment program to all admitted\r\nyouth. Youth are considered for admission to Barrett if they are male,\r\naged 11 to 18, have a sentence of six to 18 months, and have a\r\nrecommended or mandatory need for substance abuse treatment as\r\ndetermined by the Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), which\r\nassesses youths' needs prior to sentencing. Barrett's treatment\r\nprogram takes a therapeutic community approach, which emphasizes\r\naltering negative attitudes and behaviors through the completion of\r\nfour sequential phases of treatment. In contrast, the goal of the\r\ntraditional institutions was to achieve public safety while meeting\r\nthe disciplinary, medical, recreational, and treatment needs of the\r\nyouth. These facilities offered some treatment programs but only on an\r\n\"as needed\" basis. The sample for this study consists of all 412 youth\r\nreleased from Barrett Juvenile Correctional Center from July 1, 1998,\r\nto June 30, 2000, and a matched sample of 406 youth released from\r\nother juvenile correctional centers in Virginia during the same\r\nperiod. The treatment staff at Barrett submitted information on\r\nyouths' treatment progress at the time of discharge. The RDC provided\r\ndemographic, criminal history, and assessment information for all\r\nyouths. The Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice provided\r\ninformation concerning actual time served and recidivism at the\r\njuvenile level.

The effectiveness of\r\nBarrett's program was also assessed by comparing the outcomes of youth\r\nwho were admitted to Barrett but who differed according to how many of\r\nthe four phases of treatment, focused on modifying negative attitudes\r\nand behaviors, they completed. Barrett differs from the six other\r\njuvenile correctional centers in Virginia in that it provides a highly\r\nstructured substance abuse treatment program to all admitted\r\nyouth. Youth are considered for admission to Barrett if they are male,\r\naged 11 to 18, have a sentence of six to 18 months, and have a\r\nrecommended or mandatory need for substance abuse treatment as\r\ndetermined by the Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), which\r\nassesses youths' needs prior to sentencing. Barrett's treatment\r\nprogram takes a therapeutic community approach, which emphasizes\r\naltering negative attitudes and behaviors through the completion of\r\nfour sequential phases of treatment. In contrast, the goal of the\r\ntraditional institutions was to achieve public safety while meeting\r\nthe disciplinary, medical, recreational, and treatment needs of the\r\nyouth. These facilities offered some treatment programs but only on an\r\n\"as needed\" basis. The sample for this study consists of all 412 youth\r\nreleased from Barrett Juvenile Correctional Center from July 1, 1998,\r\nto June 30, 2000, and a matched sample of 406 youth released from\r\nother juvenile correctional centers in Virginia during the same\r\nperiod. The treatment staff at Barrett submitted information on\r\nyouths' treatment progress at the time of discharge. The RDC provided\r\ndemographic, criminal history, and assessment information for all\r\nyouths. The Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice provided\r\ninformation concerning actual time served and recidivism at the\r\njuvenile level. The Virginia State Police supplied additional\r\nrecidivism data, including information on adult recidivism. Parole\r\nofficers also provided data on recidivism and on progress toward\r\nmeeting the conditions of parole. Demographic variables included in\r\nthe dataset are race of the offender and his age at\r\ncommitment.

Victims were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Victims\r\nwere interviewed, with an impact statement written and immediately\r\ndistributed to the prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge on the\r\ncase, (2) Victims were interviewed to assess impact but no statement\r\nwas written, and (3) Victims were assigned to a control condition in\r\nwhich there was no interview or statement. Subsequent interviews\r\nevaluated victims' perceptions of their role in the proceedings and\r\ntheir satisfaction with the outcome. Data were also recorded on\r\ncharges filed against the defendants (both the arraignment and final\r\ncharges), sentences, and special conditions of sentences. Standard\r\ndemographic information was gathered as well. The remaining variables\r\nfall into two categories. The first category includes questions about\r\nthe defendant(s) in the case. For all defendants in each case (up to\r\nsix per victim) the researchers recorded information on the nature and\r\nseverity of the arraignment charges and final charges, and on the\r\nsentence received. Additional information was recorded for the first\r\nand second defendants in a case. This included information on special\r\nconditions of the sentence such as a drug treatment program or\r\nrestraining order. Orders to pay restitution were noted. Also recorded\r\nwas information on the defendant's status with the criminal justice\r\nsystem, including number of prior convictions and number of open cases\r\nagainst the defendant. Finally, whether the Victim Impact Statement\r\nappeared in the assistant district attorney's file on the case and\r\nwhether the statement had been opened were noted. The second category\r\nof variables includes information about the victim's reactions to the\r\ncrime and the criminal justice system. Victims were asked to assess\r\nthe impact the crime had on them in terms of physical injury,\r\nfinancial losses, psychological effect, and behavioral effect (i.e.,\r\nchanges in behavior resulting from the experience). They were also\r\nquestioned about their experiences with the criminal justice\r\nsystem. The researchers inquired about their participation in the\r\nsentencing decision, their satisfaction with the outcome, and how they\r\nfelt they had been treated by various court officials. Victims were\r\nasked whether they felt that court officials were aware of and were\r\nconcerned about the effect the crime had on them. They were also asked\r\nwhether victims should have a greater role in the court proceedings\r\nand whether court officials should be aware of victim impact as part\r\nof the sentencing procedure. Finally, the researchers investigated\r\nwhether the victims believed that going to court was a waste of time.",

Victims were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) Victims\r\nwere interviewed, with an impact statement written and immediately\r\ndistributed to the prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge on the\r\ncase, (2) Victims were interviewed to assess impact but no statement\r\nwas written, and (3) Victims were assigned to a control condition in\r\nwhich there was no interview or statement. Subsequent interviews\r\nevaluated victims' perceptions of their role in the proceedings and\r\ntheir satisfaction with the outcome. Data were also recorded on\r\ncharges filed against the defendants (both the arraignment and final\r\ncharges), sentences, and special conditions of sentences. Standard\r\ndemographic information was gathered as well. The remaining variables\r\nfall into two categories. The first category includes questions about\r\nthe defendant(s) in the case. For all defendants in each case (up to\r\nsix per victim) the researchers recorded information on the nature and\r\nseverity of the arraignment charges and final charges, and on the\r\nsentence received. Additional information was recorded for the first\r\nand second defendants in a case. This included information on special\r\nconditions of the sentence such as a drug treatment program or\r\nrestraining order. Orders to pay restitution were noted. Also recorded\r\nwas information on the defendant's status with the criminal justice\r\nsystem, including number of prior convictions and number of open cases\r\nagainst the defendant. Finally, whether the Victim Impact Statement\r\nappeared in the assistant district attorney's file on the case and\r\nwhether the statement had been opened were noted. The second category\r\nof variables includes information about the victim's reactions to the\r\ncrime and the criminal justice system. Victims were asked to assess\r\nthe impact the crime had on them in terms of physical injury,\r\nfinancial losses, psychological effect, and behavioral effect (i.e.,\r\nchanges in behavior resulting from the experience). They were also\r\nquestioned about their experiences with the criminal justice\r\nsystem. The researchers inquired about their participation in the\r\nsentencing decision, their satisfaction with the outcome, and how they\r\nfelt they had been treated by various court officials. Victims were\r\nasked whether they felt that court officials were aware of and were\r\nconcerned about the effect the crime had on them. They were also asked\r\nwhether victims should have a greater role in the court proceedings\r\nand whether court officials should be aware of victim impact as part\r\nof the sentencing procedure. Finally, the researchers investigated\r\nwhether the victims believed that going to court was a waste of time.",

The collection contains \r\n estimates from national data of annual age-by-race specific arrest \r\n rates and crime rates for murder, robbery, and burglary over the \r\n 21-year period 1965-1985. The data address the following questions: (1) \r\n Are the crime rates reported by the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) data \r\n series valid indicators of national crime trends? (2) How much of the \r\n change between 1965 and 1985 in total crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary is attributable to changes in the age and race composition \r\n of the population, and how much is accounted for by changes in crime \r\n rates within age-by-race specific subgroups? (3) What are the effects \r\n of age and race on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, and \r\n burglary? (4) What is the effect of time period on subgroup crime rates \r\n for murder, robbery, and burglary? (5) What is the effect of birth \r\n cohort, particularly the effect of the very large (baby-boom) cohorts \r\n following World War II, on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary? (6) What is the effect of interactions among age, race, \r\n time period, and cohort on subgroup crime rates for murder, robbery, \r\n and burglary? (7) How do patterns of age-by-race specific crime rates \r\n for murder, robbery, and burglary compare for different demographic \r\n subgroups? The variables in this study fall into four categories. The \r\n first category includes variables that define the race-age cohort of \r\n the unit of observation. The values of these variables are directly \r\n available from UCR and include year of observation (from 1965-1985), \r\n age group, and race. The second category of variables were computed \r\n using UCR data pertaining to the first category of variables. These are \r\n period, birth cohort of age group in each year, and average cohort size \r\n for each single age within each single group. The third category \r\n includes variables that describe the annual age-by-race specific arrest \r\n rates for the different crime types. These variables were estimated for \r\n race, age, group, crime type, and year using data directly available \r\n from UCR and population estimates from Census publications. The fourth \r\n category includes variables similar to the third group.

Four primary issues were addressed: \r\n (1) To what extent the PMC reduces rates of assaults on staff and \r\n inmates, (2) To what extent the PMC reduces rates of other serious \r\n misconduct, (3) To what extent the PMC increases rates of inmate \r\n participation in work or vocational programs, and (4) To what extent \r\n the PMC enhances staff job satisfaction, morale, and staff performance. \r\n Information is included on outcome variables against which comparisons \r\n between the experimental and control groups can be made. For each \r\n correctional facility, figures were collected for the number of \r\n staff-inmate assaults, number of inmate-inmate assaults, number of \r\n suicides and suicide attempts, number of escapes and escape attempts, \r\n number of \"serious\" disciplinary incidents, number of total staff, \r\n number of inmates, number of security staff vacancies, rated capacity \r\n of the facility, number of staff transfers and reasons, and number of \r\n inmates involved in educational, vocational, and work programs. \r\n Demographic variables include date of birth, sex, and race.

Only those born in 1955 were considered\r\nto have potential for substantial contact with drugs, and thus only\r\nthe younger cohort was targeted for this collection.

The file contains\r\ninformation on the most serious offense during the juvenile and adult\r\nperiods, the number of police contacts grouped by age of the cohort\r\nmember, seriousness of the reason for police contact, drugs involved\r\nin the incident, the reason police gave for the person having the\r\ndrugs, the reason police gave for the contact, and the neighborhood in\r\nwhich the juvenile was socialized.

The Home and Life\r\nInterview, like the HOME inventory, sought to observe the\r\ndevelopmental environment in which children belonging to the\r\nLongitudinal Cohort Study sample were raised.

In contrast to Wave 1,\r\nparticular emphasis was placed on evaluating the relationship between\r\nthe subject and the subject's father or, in the father's absence, a\r\nmale father figure. An important feature of the Wave 1 HOME inventory\r\nwas the data collected that described the interior and exterior\r\nconditions of the respondent's home and neighborhood. Similar\r\nobservations were recorded, however, for Wave 2. This information was\r\ndocumented in the Interviewer Impressions data found in PROJECT ON\r\nHUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): INTERVIEWER\r\nIMPRESSIONS (PRIMARY CAREGIVER), WAVE 1, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13631) and\r\nin PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN):\r\nINTERVIEWER IMPRESSIONS (SUBJECT), WAVE 1, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13632).",

Part 1 (Study One Data) assessed the causal impact of Neighborhood Watch sign presence and content on perceptions of the community. Three Neighborhood Watch signs were incorporated into a series of slide show presentations. The signs utilized the traditional orange and white color scheme with black text and were used to represent an injunctive norm alone, a low descriptive norm for crime, or a high descriptive norm for crime. Digital color images of a for-sale home and the surrounding neighborhood of a middle class community in North San Diego County were shown to 180 undergraduates recruited from the Psychology Department's Human Participant Pool, and from other lower division general education courses at California State University, San Marcos, between July and November of 2005. Three of the slide shows were designated as Neighborhood Watch communities with one of the three sign types posted, and the fourth slide show served as a control with no posted crime prevention signs. Each slide show consisted of 20 images of the home and community, along with four instruction slides. Part 2 (Study Two Data) replicated the basic effect from Study 1 and extended the research to examine the moderating role of community social economic status (SES) on the effects of the Neighborhood Watch signs. Participants were 547 undergraduate students recruited from the Psychology Department's Human Participant Pool, and from other lower division general education courses at California State University and Palomar Community College in San Marcos, between January and September 2006. A total of 12 slide shows were utilized in Study Two, such that each of the four sign conditions from Study One was represented across each of the three communities (Low, Middle, and High SES). Part 3 (Study Three Data) examined the potential for the physical condition of the Neighborhood Watch signs posted in the community to convey normative information about the presence and acceptance of crime in the community. Participants were 364 undergraduate students recruited from the Psychology Department's Human Participant Pool, and from other lower division general education courses at California State University and Palomar Community College in San Marcos, between October 2006 and March 2007. Study Three used the same generic (Injunctive Norm, Program Only) sign that was utilized in Studies One and\r\nTwo. However, three variations (new, aged, and defaced) of the sign were used. The surveys used for Study One, Study Two, and Study Three, were identical.

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to examine the crime of identity theft from the offenders' perspectives. The study employed a purposive sampling strategy. Researchers identified potential interview subjects by examining newspapers (using Lexis-Nexis), legal documents (using Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw), and United States Attorneys' Web sites for individuals charged with, indicted, and/or sentenced to prison for identity theft. Once this list was generated, researchers used the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Inmate Locator to determine if the individuals were currently housed in federal facilities. Researchers visited the facilities that housed the largest number of inmates on the list in each of the six regions in the United States as defined by the BOP (Western, North Central, South Central, North Eastern, Mid-Atlantic, and South Eastern) and solicited the inmates housed in these prisons. A total of 14 correctional facilities were visited and 65 individuals incarcerated for identity theft or identity theft related crimes were interviewed between March 2006 and February 2007. Researchers used semi-structured interviews to explore the offenders' decision-making processes. When possible, interviews were audio recorded and then transcribed verbatim. Part 1 (Quantitative Data) includes the demographic variables age, race, gender, number of children, highest level of education, and socioeconomic class while growing up. Other variables include prior arrests or convictions and offense type, prior drug use and if drug use contributed to identity theft, if employment facilitated identity theft, if they went to trial or plead to charges, and sentence length. Part 2 (Qualitative Data), includes demographic questions such as family situation while growing up, highest level of education, marital status, number of children, and employment status while committing identity theft crimes. Subjects were asked about prior criminal activity and drug use. Questions specific to identity theft include the age at which the person became involved  in identity theft, how many identities he or she had stolen, if they had worked with other people to steal identities, why they had become involved in identity theft, the skills necessary to steal identities, and the perceived risks involved in identity theft.",

Researchers identified potential interview subjects by examining newspapers (using Lexis-Nexis), legal documents (using Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw), and United States Attorneys' Web sites for individuals charged with, indicted, and/or sentenced to prison for identity theft. Once this list was generated, researchers used the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Inmate Locator to determine if the individuals were currently housed in federal facilities. Researchers visited the facilities that housed the largest number of inmates on the list in each of the six regions in the United States as defined by the BOP (Western, North Central, South Central, North Eastern, Mid-Atlantic, and South Eastern) and solicited the inmates housed in these prisons. A total of 14 correctional facilities were visited and 65 individuals incarcerated for identity theft or identity theft related crimes were interviewed between March 2006 and February 2007.

The first goal was to identify how many women in the United States and in college settings have ever been raped or sexually assaulted during their lifetime and within the past year.  The next goal was to identify key case characteristics of drug-facilitated and forcible rapes.  The third goal was to examine factors that affect the willingness of women to report rape to law enforcement or seek help from their support network.  The last goal was to make comparisons between the different types of rape.  Part 1 (General Population) data consisted of a national telephone household sample of 3,001 United States women, whereas Part 2 (College Population) data consisted of 2,000 college women selected from a reasonably representative national list of women attending four year colleges and universities.  Both data parts contain the same 399 variables. Interviews were completed between January 23 and June 26, 2006.  Respondents were asked questions regarding risk perception, fear of violence, and accommodation behavior.  The women were also asked their opinions and attitudes about reporting rape to the authorities and disclosing rape to family members, peers, or other individuals. This includes questions about barriers to reporting and experiences that women have had being the recipient of a disclosure from a friend, relative, or other individual.  The respondents were asked a series of questions about rape, including different types of forcible, drug- or alcohol-facilitated, and incapacitated rape.  For women who endorsed one or more rape experiences, a wide range of rape characteristics were assessed including characteristics around the nature of the event, perpetrator-victim relationship, occurrence of injury, involvement of drugs or alcohol, receipt of medical care, and whether the rape was reported to the authorities.  The respondents were also asked a series of questions regarding substance use, including prescription and illegal drugs and alcohol.  Additionally, a series of questions related to post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were asked.  Finally, the women were asked to provide basic demographic information such as age, race, ethnicity, and income.",

-            "description": "The study set out to test the question of whether more efficacious outcomes would be gained the closer that a second response by police officers occurs to an actual domestic violence event.  Researchers conducted a randomized experiment in which households that reported a domestic incident to the police were assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (a) second responders were dispatched to the crime scene within 24 hours, (b) second responders visited victims' homes one week after the call for service, or (c) no second response occurred. Beginning January 1, 2005, and continuing through December 3, 2005, incidents reported to the Redlands Police Department were reviewed each morning by a research assistant to determine whether the incidents involved intimate partners. Cases were determined to be eligible if the incident was coded as a misdemeanor or felony battery of a spouse or intimate partner. Eighty-two percent of the victims were females. For designated incidents, a team of officers, including a trained female domestic violence detective, visited households within either twenty-four hours or seven days of a domestic complaint. A written protocol guided the officer or officers making home visits. Officers also asked the victim a series of questions about her relationship with the abuser, history of abuse, and the presence of children and weapons in the home. In Part 1 (Home Visit Data), six months after the reporting date of the last incident in the study, Redlands Police crime analysis officers wrote a software program to search their database to determine if any new incidents had been reported. For Part 2 (New Incident Data), the search returned any cases associated with the same victim in the trigger incident. For any new incidents identified, information was collected on the date, charge, and identity of the perpetrator. Six months following the trigger incident, research staff attempted to interview victims about any new incidents of abuse that might have occurred. These interview attempts were made by telephone. In cases where the victim could not be reached by phone, an incentive letter was sent to the victim's home, offering a $50 stipend to call the research offices.  Part 1 (Home Visit Data) contains 345 cases while Part 2 (New Incident Data) contains 344 cases. The discrepancy in the final number across the two parts is due to cases randomized into the sample that turned out to be ineligible or had been assigned previously from another incident.  Part 1 (Home Visit Data) contains 63 variables including basic administrative variables such as date(s) of contact and group assignment. There are also variables related to the victim and the perpetrator such as their relationship, whether the perpetrator was arrested during the incident, and whether the perpetrator was present during the interview. Victims were also asked a series of questions as to whether the perpetrator did such things as hit, push, or threatened the victim. Part 2 (New Incident Data) contains 68 variables including dates and charges of previous incidents as well as basic administrative and demographic variables.",

The 1984-1985 Pooled Dependency and Neglect Cohort Data (Part 3) includes 4,474 cases which correspond to up to 20 complaints for each of the 1,062 alleged dependent and neglected children. The second group was selected from delinquency petitions of children 16 and 17 years old filed in the years 2000 and 2001. The 2000-2001 Non-Pooled Delinquency Cohort Data (Part 2) contains a total of 549 cases, representing 549 delinquent children. The 2000-2001 Pooled Delinquency Cohort Data (Part 4) includes 2,076 cases which correspond to up to 20 complaints for each of the 549 delinquent children.  Part 1 contains a total of 11 and Part 2 contains a total of 10 demographics and summary count information variables.  Part 3 and Part 4 contain a total of 68 and 58 variables, respectively, including demographics and information on delinquent charges, complaints of maltreatment, placements, and dispositions for each child.",

Following an extensive effort to identify potential sites for inclusion in the TCC/CW program outcome evaluation, a quasi-experimental five-wave panel study of public school students was initiated in the fall of 2004.

The national evaluation utilized data collected through stakeholder surveys, direct service worker surveys, child welfare case file reviews, and site visit interviews between 2001 and 2006. The purpose of the national evaluation was to develop and implement a strategy for gaining a formative understanding of sites' planning and implementation processes and a summative assessment of the impact of such work on communities, systems, and families. Part 1 (Stakeholder Survey Data) includes variables on the respondent's level of involvement in the organization and barriers to implementing Greenbook initiatives. The baseline stakeholder survey was conducted in 2002 with a total of 86 respondents across sites, and follow-up data were collected three years later (2005) with a total of 62 respondents. Part 2 through Part 7 (Direct Service Worker, and Supervisor Data) include variables on the respondents' race, gender, and length of time at the child welfare agency, court, or domestic violence service provider. Respondents are asked about the hours of training received over the past year, the presence of written reporting guidelines, screening tools, and working relationships with the other agency types. The baseline direct service worker survey was conducted after the end of the demonstration planning period (2003) with a total of 275 respondents across sites, and follow-up data were collected two years later (2005) with a total of 224 respondents. Part 8 (Case Abstractions Data) includes variables on substantiated cases of child maltreatment, risk factors contributing to maltreatment attributed to the mother, the father, or other caregiver, documentation of domestic violence and services provided to the victims and perpetrators. A random sample of substantiated cases of child maltreatment was reviewed in each site at the beginning of the demonstration initiative (2001) with a total of 616 case files reviewed across sites, after the end of the planning period (2003) with a total of 642 case files reviewed across sites, and toward the end of the implementation period (2005) with a total of 562 case files reviewed across sites. Part 9 (Site Visit Interview Notes Qualitative Data) includes questions on structure of services, policies and procedures, training, and the strengths and needs of the site. Site visits were conducted between January 2001 and June 2006 with interviewers with at least one collaborative member from each of the three primary systems (child welfare agency, courts, domestic violence service provider).",

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adult sexual assault cases in a Midwestern community were more likely to be investigated and prosecuted after the implementation of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program, and to identify the 'critical ingredients' that contributed to that increase.\r\nPart 1 (Study 1: Case Records Quantitative Data) used a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent comparison group cohort design to compare criminal justice systems outcomes for adult sexual assault cases treated in county hospitals five years prior to the implementation of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program (January 1994 to August 1999) (the comparison group, n=156) to cases treated in the focal SANE program during its first seven years of operation (September 1999 to December 2005) (the intervention group, n=137). Variables include focus on case outcome, law enforcement agency that handled the case, DNA findings, and county-level factors, including prosecutor elections and the emergence of the focal SANE program.\r\nPart 2 (Study 2: Case Characteristics Quantitative Data) used the adult sexual assault cases from the Study 1 intervention group (post-SANE) (n=137) to examine whether victim characteristics, assault characteristics, and the presence and type of medical forensic evidence predicted case progression outcomes.\r\nPart 3 (Study 3: Police and Prosecutors Interview Qualitative Data) used in-depth interviews in April and May of 2007 with law enforcement supervisors (n=9) and prosecutors (n=6) in the focal county responsible for the prosecution of adult sexual assault crimes to explore if and how the SANEs affect the way in which police and prosecutors approach such cases. The interviews focused on four main topics: (1) whether they perceived a change in investigations and prosecution of adult sexual assault cases in post-SANE, (2) their assessment of the quality and utility of the forensic evidence provided by SANEs, (3) their perceptions regarding whether inter-agency training has improved the quality of police investigations and reports post-SANE, and (4) their perceptions regarding if and how the SANE program increased communication and collaboration among legal and medical personnel, and if such changes have influenced law enforcement investigational practices or prosecutor charging decisions.Part 4 (Study 4: Police Reports Quantitative Data) examined police reports written before and after the implementation of the SANE program to determine whether there had been substantive changes in ways sexual assaults cases were investigated since the emergence of the SANE program. Variables include whether the police had referred the case to the prosecutor, indicators of SANE involvement, and indicators of law enforcement effort.\r\nPart 5 (Study 5: Survivor Interview Qualitative Data) focused on understanding how victims characterized the care they received at the focal SANE program as well as their expriences with the criminal justices system. Using prospective sampling and community-based retrospective purposive sampling, twenty adult sexual assault vicitims were identified and interviewed between January 2006 and May 2007. Interviews covered four topics: (1) the rape itself and initial disclosures, (2) victims' experiences with SANE program staff including nurses and victim support advocates, (3) the specific role forensic evidence played in victims' decisions to participate in prosecution, and (4) victims' experiences with law enforcement, prosecutors, and judicial proceedings, and if/how the forensic nurses and advocates influenced those interactions.\r\nPart 6 (Study 6: Forensic Nurse Interview Qualitative Data) examined forensic nurses' perspectives on how the SANE program could affect survivor participation with prosecution indirectly and how the interactions between SANEs and law enforcement could be contributing to increased investigational effort. Between July and August of 2008, six Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) were interviewed. The interviews explored three topics: (1) the nurses' philosophy on victim reporting and participating in prosecution, (2) their perceptions regarding how patient care may or may not affect victim participation in the criminal justice system, and (3) their perception of how the SANE programs influence the work of law enforcement investigational practices.The interviews explored three topics: (1) the nurses' philosophy on victim reporting and participating in prosecution, (2) their perceptions regarding how patient care may or may not affect victim participation in the criminal justice system, and (3) their perception of how the SANE programs influence the work of law enforcement investigational practices.",

Using a mixed-methods approach, administrative records from the DANY case-management systems and prosecutorial interviews were examined to study case acceptance for prosecution, pretrial detention and bail determination, case dismissal, plea offers, and sentencing. Researchers developed five hypotheses for the data collected: \r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to have their cases accepted for prosecution than similarly situated white defendants.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to be held in pretrial detention and less likely to be released on bail.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are less likely to have cases dismissed.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are less likely to receive a plea offer to a lesser charge and more likely to receive custodial sentence offers. \r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to be sentenced to custodial punishments.\r\nAll criminal activity of the defendant was examined, as well as their demographics and prior history, the location of the crime. Information on the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) was examined as well, including their demographics and caseload in order to more thoroughly understand the catalysts and trends in decision making.",
