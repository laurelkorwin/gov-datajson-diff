One\r\n unique feature of PROMIS that addresses these problems is the\r\n automated evaluation of cases. Through the application of a uniform\r\n set of criteria, PROMIS assigns two numerical ratings to each case:\r\n one signifying the gravity of the crime through a measurement of the\r\n amount of harm done to society, and the other signifying the gravity\r\n of the prior criminal record of the accused. These ratings make it\r\n possible to select the more important cases for intensive, pre-trial\r\n preparation and to assure even-handed treatment of cases of like\r\n gravity. A complementary feature of PROMIS is the automation of\r\n reasons for decisions made or actions taken along the assembly\r\n line.

+            "description": "The Prosecutor's Management Information System (PROMIS) is\r\n a computer-based information system for public prosecution agencies.\r\n PROMIS was initially developed with funds from the United States Law\r\n Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) to cope with problems of\r\n a large, urban prosecution agency where mass production operations had\r\n superceded the traditional practice of a single attorney preparing and\r\n prosecuting a given case from inception to final disposition. The\r\n combination of massive volumes of cases and assembly-line\r\n fragmentation of responsibility and control had created a situation in\r\n which one case was indistinguishable from another and the effects of\r\n problems at various stages in the assembly line on ultimate case\r\n disposition went undetected and uncorrected. One unique feature of\r\n PROMIS that addresses these problems is the automated evaluation of\r\n cases.  Through the application of a uniform set of criteria, PROMIS\r\n assigns two numerical ratings to each case: one signifying the gravity\r\n of the crimes through the measurement of the amount of harm done to\r\n society, and the other signifying the gravity of the prior record of\r\n the accused. These ratings make it possible to select the more\r\n important cases for intensive, pre-trial preparation and to assure\r\n even-handed treatment of cases with similar degrees of gravity. A\r\n complementary feature of PROMIS is the automation of reasons for\r\n decisions made or actions taken along the assembly line. Reasons for\r\n dismissing cases prior to trial on their merits can be related to\r\n earlier cycles of postponement for various reasons and the reasoning\r\n behind intake and screening decisions. The PROMIS data include\r\n information about the defendant, case characteristics and processes,\r\n charge, sentencing and continuance processes, and the witness/victims\r\n involved in the case. PROMIS was first used in 1971 in the United\r\n States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. To enhance the\r\n ability to transfer the concepts and software to other communities,\r\n LEAA awarded a grant to the Institute for Law and Social Research\r\n (INSLAW) in Washington, DC. The St. Louis PROMIS data collection is a\r\nproduct of this grant.",

The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.",

The jail component of the DCRP collects data on the death of any inmate in their custody, even if the inmate was being held for another jurisdiction, such as the state department of corrections, another state or county, or the federal government. Jail deaths include the death of any inmate sent outside the jail facility for medical, mental health or substance abuse treatment services, or for work-release programs. Deaths that occur while an inmate is in transit to or from the jail facility are included.

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) expanded the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and causes of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States hospitals with emergency departments (EDs). This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually.

The CSLLEA was last conducted in 2014 but encountered data collection issues. Since the last law enforcement universe list was the 2008 CSLLEA, BJS decided further work was needed to have a reliable and complete roster of law enforcement agencies. Using the 2008 and 2014 CSLLEA universe as the base, the LEAR integrated multiple datasets in an effort to compile a complete list of active general purpose law enforcement agencies. The goal of the LEAR was to serve as the universe list for which the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) core and supplement samples could be pulled. The 2016 LEAR contains a census of 15,810 general purpose law enforcement agencies, including 12,695 local and county police departments, 3,066 sheriffs' offices and 49 primary state police departments.

In each of\r\nthe years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is\r\nconducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails\r\nand inmates housed in these jails.  Data are supplied on admissions\r\nand releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in\r\ntheir rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the\r\npopulation supervised in the community, changes in methods of\r\ncommunity supervision, and crowding issues in state and federal\r\nprisons. The data are intended for a variety of users, including\r\nfederal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail\r\nadministrators, researchers, planners, and the public.Years\r\nProduced: Annually, except every 5th year when the National\r\nJail Census is produced.\r\n",

In \r\naddition to the state prisons, the California Youth Authority reported data from 1984 to 2011. The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported data to NCRP from 1984 to 1996.

The NCRP evolved from the need to improve and \r\nconsolidate data on corrections at the national level. Its objective was to \r\nprovide a consistent and comprehensive description of prisoners entering and \r\nleaving the custody or supervision of state and federal authorities. In \r\naddition to the state prisons, the California Youth Authority reported data from 1984 to 2011. The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported data to NCRP from 1984 to 1996. Federal data are now collected by BJS under the Federal Justice Statistics Program.NACJD has prepared a resource guide for the NCRP Series.\r\n",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident.

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\r\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2013 Annual Survey of Jails is the 26th such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues.  The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to the survey, data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.\r\nTo address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2013.  These data are used to track growth in the number of\r\njails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the\r\njail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of\r\ncrowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail\r\npopulation.  The data are intended for a variety of users, including\r\nfederal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail\r\nadministrators, researchers, planners, and the public.  The reference date\r\nfor the survey is June 30, 2013.",

Seven main classifications of crime were\r\nchosen to gauge fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of\r\ncrime. These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\nCrime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\nmanslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\nproperty crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\nBy congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\nin 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\nattempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\npublic building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\nanother, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\nof arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\narrest or other means. The counts include all reports of arson\r\nreceived from victims, officers who discovered infractions, or other\r\nsources.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 11 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. Prior to 2013 the data were archived and distributed as 13 separate data files, including three separate batch header record files. Starting with the 2013 data, the FBI combined the three batch header files into one file. Consequently, ICPSR instituted new file numbering for the data. NIBRS data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 2 (formerly Part 4), Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time).

The initial files remain available for research purposes.\r\nThe National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.

The initial files remain available for research purposes.\r\nThe National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously called the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2016. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 36828.",

However, analyzing crime data at the intermediate level, the city or place, has been difficult, as has merging disparate data sources that have no common match keys. To facilitate the creation and analysis of place-level data and linking reported crime data with data from other sources, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) created the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk (LEAIC).\r\nThe crosswalk file was designed to provide geographic and other identification information for each record included in the FBI's UCR files and Bureau of Justice Statistics' Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA). The LEAIC records contain common match keys for merging reported crime data and Census Bureau data. These linkage variables include the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) code, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county and place codes, and Governments Integrated Directory government identifier codes. These variables make it possible for researchers to take police agency-level data, combine them with Bureau of the Census and BJS data, and perform place-level, jurisdiction-level, and government-level analyses.",

However, analyzing crime data at the intermediate level, the city or place, has been difficult, as has merging disparate data sources that have no common match keys. To facilitate the creation and analysis of place-level data and linking reported crime data with data from other sources, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) created the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk (LEAIC).\r\nThe crosswalk file was designed to provide geographic and other identification information for each record included in the FBI's UCR files and Bureau of Justice Statistics' Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA). The LEAIC records contain common match keys for merging reported crime data and Census Bureau data. These linkage variables include the Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) code, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county and place codes, and Governments Integrated Directory government identifier codes. These variables make it possible for researchers to take police agency-level data, combine them with Bureau of the Census and BJS data, and perform place-level, jurisdiction-level, and government-level analyses.",

The\r\nvariables are divided into four sections: basic case characteristics,\r\nparticipation, issues, and judges and votes. There is a separate data\r\nfile (Part 2) containing the number of cases with published decisions\r\nfor each circuit/year between 1925 and 1990. These data are necessary\r\nto weight the variables in the main data file (Part 1).",

The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort.

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nprovided its support, formulating a comprehensive redesign\r\neffort. Following a multiyear study and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, new guidelines for the Uniform Crime\r\nReports were created. The National Incident-Based Reporting System\r\n(NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data are\r\narchived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be merged by\r\nusing linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of aspects of a\r\ncrime incident. The Batch Header Segment (Parts 1-3) separates and\r\nidentifies individual police agencies by Originating Agency Identifier\r\n(ORI). Batch Header information, which is contained on three records\r\nfor each ORI, includes agency name, geographic location, and\r\npopulation of the area. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers data on\r\nthe incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is delineated\r\nby one administrative segment record. Also provided are Part 5,\r\nOffense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). Part 10, Group B Arrest Report\r\nSegment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes. Window Segments\r\nfiles (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the complete Group\r\nA Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In general, a Window\r\nSegment record will be generated if the incident occurred prior to\r\nJanuary 1 of the previous year or if the incident occurred prior to\r\nwhen the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with UCR, participation in\r\nNIBRS is voluntary on the part of law enforcement agencies. The data\r\nare not a representative sample of crime in the United States. For\r\n1996, nine states were fully or partially participating in NIBRS.",

The variables created from the LEOKA forms provide in-depth information on the circumstances surrounding killings or assaults, including type of call answered, type of weapon used, and type of patrol the officers were on.",

-            "description": "The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a\r\npart of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), administered by the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 11 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. Prior to 2013 the data were archived and distributed as 13 separate data files, including three separate batch header record files. Starting with the 2013 data, the FBI combined the three batch header files into one file. Consequently, ICPSR instituted new file numbering for the data. NIBRS data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 2 (formerly Part 4), Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 3 (formerly Part 5), Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 4 (formerly Part 6), Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 5 (formerly Part 7), Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 6 (formerly Part 8), Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 7 (formerly Part 9), Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Part 1, formerly Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 8 (formerly Part 10), Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\nWindow Segments files (Parts 9-11, formerly Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\ncomplete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\ngeneral, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\noccurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\noccurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\nUCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 11 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. Prior to 2013 the data were archived and distributed as 13 separate data files, including three separate batch header record files. Starting with the 2013 data, the FBI combined the three batch header files into one file. Consequently, ICPSR instituted new file numbering for the data. NIBRS data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 2 (formerly Part 4), Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 3 (formerly Part 5), Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 4 (formerly Part 6), Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 5 (formerly Part 7), Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 6 (formerly Part 8), Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 7 (formerly Part 9), Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Part 1, formerly Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 8 (formerly Part 10), Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\nWindow Segments files (Parts 9-11, formerly Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\ncomplete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\ngeneral, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\noccurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\noccurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\nUCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the complete censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\r\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2016 Annual Survey of Jails is the 29th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-U.S. citizens in custody. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2016. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-U.S. citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including Federal and State agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is December 31, 2016.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\ndata are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B\r\ncrimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for\r\nwhich the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the\r\nFBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the\r\nincident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the\r\nincident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As\r\nwith UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States. For 2000, 18 states, fully or partially\r\nparticipating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC) in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC) expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (EDs). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries\r\nassociated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to\r\ninclude all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1)\r\nmeasure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the\r\nUnited States, (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal\r\ninjuries over time, (3) identify emerging injury problems, (4)\r\nidentify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular\r\ninjury-related problems, and (5) set national priorities. A\r\nfundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary\r\nsurveillance data are made available in a timely manner to a number of\r\ndifferent federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health\r\nresponsibilities and concerns. Also, the final edited data are\r\nreleased annually on a public use data file for use by other public\r\nhealth professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

The reports, which were\r\n published monthly from 1930 to 1931, quarterly from 1932 to 1940, and\r\n annually from 1941 to 1959, consist of tables showing the number of\r\n offenses known to the police as reported to the Federal Bureau of\r\n Investigation by contributing police departments. The term \"offenses\r\n known to the police\" includes those crimes designated as Part I\r\n classes of the Uniform Classification code occurring within the police\r\n jurisdiction, whether they became known to the police through reports\r\n of police officers, citizens, prosecuting or court officials, or\r\n otherwise. They were confined to the following group of seven classes\r\n of grave offenses, historically those offenses most often and most\r\n completely reported to the police: felonious homicide, including\r\n murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, and manslaughter by negligence,\r\n rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary -- breaking and entering,\r\n and larceny -- theft (including thefts $50 and over, and thefts under\r\n $50, and auto theft). The figures also included the number of\r\n attempted crimes in the designated classes excepting attempted murders\r\n classed as aggravated assaults. In other words, an attempted burglary\r\n or robbery, for example, was reported in the same manner as if the\r\n crimes had been completed. \"Offenses known to the police\" included,\r\n therefore, all of the above offenses, including attempts, which were\r\n reported by the police departments and not merely arrests or cleared\r\ncases.",

The reports, which were\r\n published monthly from 1930 to 1931, quarterly from 1932 to 1940, and\r\n annually from 1941 to 1959, consist of tables showing the number of\r\n offenses known to the police as reported to the Federal Bureau of\r\n Investigation by contributing police departments. The term \"offenses\r\n known to the police\" includes those crimes designated as Part I\r\n classes of the Uniform Classification code occurring within the police\r\n jurisdiction, whether they became known to the police through reports\r\n of police officers, citizens, prosecuting or court officials, or\r\n otherwise. They were confined to the following group of seven classes\r\n of grave offenses, historically those offenses most often and most\r\n completely reported to the police: felonious homicide, including\r\n murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, and manslaughter by negligence,\r\n rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary -- breaking and entering,\r\n and larceny -- theft (including thefts $50 and over, and thefts under\r\n $50, and auto theft). The figures also included the number of\r\n attempted crimes in the designated classes excepting attempted murders\r\n classed as aggravated assaults. In other words, an attempted burglary\r\n or robbery, for example, was reported in the same manner as if the\r\n crimes had been completed. \"Offenses known to the police\" included,\r\n therefore, all of the above offenses, including attempts, which were\r\n reported by the police departments and not merely arrests or cleared\r\ncases.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",
