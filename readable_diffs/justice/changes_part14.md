One of\r\n the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Youth\r\n Self Report (YSR). The YSR protocol, a self-administered survey, was\r\n first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and was derived from another\r\n widely-used standardized measure in child psychology, the Child\r\n Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The YSR was designed to assess the\r\n emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents (aged 11 to 18) in a\r\n standardized format. The PHDCN version of the YSR was administered to\r\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 12 and 15 of the Longitudinal Cohort\r\n Study. It assessed internalizing (i.e., anxiety, depression, and\r\n overcontrolled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactivity,\r\n noncompliant, and undercontrolled) behaviors. Eight sub-scale\r\n symptoms (Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxiety and Depression,\r\n Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Aggressive\r\nBehavior, and Delinquent Behaviors) were also measured.",

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except of the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompany readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collections and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThis study consists of a secondary analysis of data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS) to investigate associations between immigration, misbehavior, victimization, disorder, and educational failure (i.e., dropping out). Six research questions that were addressed in this study include: do school social bonds vary across immigration generations? Second, is student violence (i.e., misbehavior and victimization) explained by school social bonds across generations? Third, are student violence and school disorder related to the children immigrants' likelihood of dropping out? Fourth, are strong school social bonds mitigating the likelihood of dropping out for the children of immigrants?

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThis study was designed to provide a mixed methods comparative evaluation of three established court-based programs that serve offenders with serious mental illness (SMI). These programs were selected in response to criticism of similar research for studying young programs that are still in development, employing short follow up periods that are unable to indicate sustained effectiveness, and utilizing less than ideal comparison conditions. The study was conducted in Cook County, Illinois, and data were collected from three distinct court-based programs: the Cook County Felony Mental Health Court (MHC) which serves individuals with SMI who have been arrested for nonviolent felonies, the Specialized Mental Health Probation Unit which involves specially trained probation officers who supervise a reduced caseload of probationers diagnosed with SMI, and the Cook County Adult Probation Department which has an active caseload of approximately 25,000 probationers, a portion of whom have SMI. Probation officer interviews were coded for themes regarding beliefs about the relationship between mental illness and crime, views on the purpose of their program, and approaches used with probationers with SMI. The coding of probationer interviews focused on experiences related to having SMI and being on probation, including: the extent to which probation was involved with mental health treatment; development of awareness of mental health issues; evaluations of the programs based on subjective experiences; and the relationship dynamics between probationers and staff.\r\nThe collection includes 3 Stata data files: DRI-R_data_for_NACJD_041315.dta with 98 cases and 61 variables, Epperson_NIJ_Quantitative_Data_for_NACJD_041315.dta with 25203 cases and 49 variables, and incarceration_data_061515.dta with 676 cases and 4 variables.

The researchers sought to demonstrate that two important\r\n social and health problems, domestic violence and trauma-related\r\n psychological distress, were connected. The project was organized\r\n into four studies, each of which addressed a specific objective: (1)\r\n Variables characterizing the perpetrator's family of procreation were\r\n used to determine the pattern of relationships among marital and\r\n family functioning, perpetrator-to-partner violence, partner's mental\r\n distress, and child behavior problems. (2) The perpetrator's early\r\n background and trauma history were studied to establish the degree to\r\n which the perpetrator's family of origin characteristics and\r\n experiences, childhood antisocial behavior, exposure to stressors in\r\n the Vietnam war zone, and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n (PTSD) symptomatology related to perpetrator-to-partner family\r\n violence. (3) The perpetrator's degree of mental distress was\r\n examined to ascertain the ways in which the current mental distress\r\n of the perpetrator was associated with marital and family\r\n functioning, violence, and current mental distress of the\r\n partner. (4) Developmental and intergenerational perspectives on\r\n violence were used to model a network of relationships explaining the\r\n potential transmission of violence across generations, commencing\r\n with the perpetrator's accounts of violence within the family of\r\n origin and terminating with reports of child behavior problems within\r\n the family of procreation. Data for this study came from the\r\n congressionally-mandated National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study\r\n (NVVRS) (Kulka et al., 1990), which sought to document the current\r\n and long-term psychological status of those who served one or more\r\n tours of duty in the Vietnam theater of operations sometime between\r\n August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, compared to their peers who served\r\n elsewhere in the military during that era and to a comparable group\r\n who never experienced military service. This study relied upon data\r\n from the National Survey and Family Interview components of the\r\n larger NVVRS. Data were collected through face-to-face structured\r\n interviews, with some supplementary self-report paper-and-pencil\r\n measures. The interview protocol was organized into 16 parts,\r\n including portions requesting information on childhood experiences\r\n and early delinquent behaviors, military service history, legal\r\n problems in the family of origin and postwar period, stressful life\r\n events, social support systems, marital and family discord and\r\n abusive behaviors, and physical and mental health. This study\r\n emphasized four categories of explanatory variables: (1) the\r\n perpetrator's accounts of family of origin characteristics and\r\n experiences, (2) the perpetrator's conduct and behavior problems\r\n prior to age 15, (3) the perpetrator's exposure to war-zone\r\n stressors, and (4) mental distress of the perpetrator, with attention\r\n to PTSD symptomatology and alcohol abuse. Additionally, the project\r\n incorporated four clusters of family of procreation criterion\r\n variables: (1) marital and family functioning, (2) perpetrator-to-\r\n partner violence, (3) partner mental distress, and (4) child behavior\r\n problems. Variables include child abuse, family histories of\r\n substance abuse, criminal activity, or mental health problems,\r\n relationship as a child with parents, misbehavior as a child, combat\r\n experience, fear for personal safety during combat, alcohol use and\r\n abuse, emotional well-being including stress, guilt, relationships\r\n with others, panic, and loneliness, acts of physical and verbal\r\n violence toward partner, children's emotional and behavioral\r\n problems, problem-solving, decision-making, and communication in\r\nfamily, and family support.",

-            "description": "As part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement\r\nAct of 1994, Congress provided funding for the development of\r\nsubstance abuse treatment programs in state and local correctional\r\nfacilities with the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) for\r\nState Prisoners Formula Grant Program. To be eligible for this\r\nfunding, programs were required to last between six and 12 months, be\r\nprovided in residential treatment facilities set apart from the\r\ngeneral correctional population, be directed at the inmate's substance\r\nabuse problems, and be intended to develop the inmate's cognitive,\r\nbehavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to address substance\r\nabuse and related problems. The Illinois Youth Center (IYC) in\r\nSt. Charles started an RSAT program on September 30, 1999. The primary\r\nemphasis of this process evaluation was to describe why and how the\r\nSt. Charles RSAT program was designed, implemented, and operated. To a\r\nlesser degree, attention was also directed toward examining the\r\neffects of program participation on offender pre-release\r\nbehavior. This was considered to be a primary indicator of program\r\nimpact. This project sought to answer the following research\r\nquestions: (1) Did the program fit within the institutional\r\nenvironment? (2) Was the program operating as a therapeutic community?\r\n(3) Were the appropriate offenders selected for program participation?\r\nand (4) Were any short-term impacts evident within the youth? This\r\nstudy followed a process evaluation design with a focus on determining\r\nhow a product or outcome was produced, rather than on assessing the\r\nproduct or outcome itself. Information in this data collection was\r\ncollected from youth participants and youth files. Subjects consisted\r\nof the 44 youths who began the RSAT program in 1999 (the treatment\r\ngroup), as well as a matched sample of non-program participants (the\r\ncomparison group). The comparison group was used to contrast\r\ninstitutional behavior of youths not in the treatment program and to\r\nestablish a non-treatment cohort for an expected follow-up impact\r\nstudy. Part 1 contains data from two surveys of program youth only,\r\nand Parts 2-4 contained data on both program youth and the comparison\r\ngroup. Part 2 data were gathered from a review of the youths' master\r\nfiles at the correctional facility. Part 3 data were obtained from\r\nbehavior action tickets (BATs), which were an institution-wide\r\nsemi-formal mechanism to recognize positive and negative youth\r\nbehavior. Part 4 data were collected from institutional disciplinary\r\nreports (IDRs). Part 1 surveyed youth about what they hoped to achieve\r\nin the RSAT program, whether they thought the program would help them,\r\nhow well they understood the program, how they assessed their own\r\nsubstance abuse problems, what they liked and disliked about the\r\nprogram, their opinions about program staff, and their recommendations\r\nfor changing the program. Demographic variables in Part 2 include age,\r\nrace, and education level. Other variables record reading test scores,\r\nmath test scores, IQ scores, location of parents, number of siblings,\r\ndrug use and frequency, criminal history, types of prior substance\r\nabuse treatments, family history of drug use, suicidal ideations, and\r\npersonality test scores. Part 3 contains monthly counts of positive\r\nand negative behavior action tickets. Part 4 contains information\r\nabout the number and types of guilty institutional disciplinary\r\nreports, the severity of the offenses, and the number and types of\r\npunishments received.",

To be eligible for this\r\nfunding, programs were required to last between six and 12 months, be\r\nprovided in residential treatment facilities set apart from the\r\ngeneral correctional population, be directed at the inmate's substance\r\nabuse problems, and be intended to develop the inmate's cognitive,\r\nbehavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to address substance\r\nabuse and related problems. The Illinois Youth Center (IYC) in\r\nSt. Charles started an RSAT program on September 30, 1999. The primary\r\nemphasis of this process evaluation was to describe why and how the\r\nSt. Charles RSAT program was designed, implemented, and operated. To a\r\nlesser degree, attention was also directed toward examining the\r\neffects of program participation on offender pre-release\r\nbehavior. This was considered to be a primary indicator of program\r\nimpact. This project sought to answer the following research\r\nquestions: (1) Did the program fit within the institutional\r\nenvironment? (2) Was the program operating as a therapeutic community?\r\n(3) Were the appropriate offenders selected for program participation?\r\nand (4) Were any short-term impacts evident within the youth? This\r\nstudy followed a process evaluation design with a focus on determining\r\nhow a product or outcome was produced, rather than on assessing the\r\nproduct or outcome itself. Information in this data collection was\r\ncollected from youth participants and youth files.

-            "description": "This project consisted of an evaluation of an elder abuse\r\n program run by the New York Police Department and Victim Services\r\n Research. The focus of the study was domestic elder abuse, which\r\n generally refers to any of several forms of maltreatment, physical\r\n abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and/or financial\r\n exploitation of an older person. The program, conducted in New York\r\n City public housing, had two complementary parts. First, public\r\n housing projects in Manhattan were assigned to one of two levels of\r\n public education (i.e., to receive or not to receive educational\r\n materials about elder abuse). Once the public education treatment had\r\n been implemented, 403 older adult residents of the housing projects\r\n who reported elder abuse to the police during the next ten months were\r\n assigned to one of two levels of follow-up to the initial police\r\n response (i.e., to receive or not to receive a home visit) as the\r\n second part of the project. The home visit intervention consisted of a\r\n strong law enforcement response designed to prevent repeat incidents\r\n of elder abuse. A team from the Domestic Violence Intervention and\r\n Education Program (DVIEP), consisting of a police officer and a social\r\n worker, followed up on domestic violence complaints with a home visit\r\n within a few days of the initial patrol response. Victims were\r\n interviewed about new victimizations following the intervention on\r\n three occasions: six weeks after the trigger incident, six months\r\n after the trigger incident, and twelve months after the trigger\r\n incident. Interviews at the three time points were identical except\r\n for the omission of background information on the second and third\r\n interviews. Demographic data collected during the first interview\r\n included age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, income, legal\r\n relationship with abuser, living situation, number of people in the\r\n household, and health. For each time point, data provide measures of\r\n physical, psychological, and financial abuse, knowledge of elder\r\n abuse, knowledge and use of social services, satisfaction with the\r\n police, assessment of service delivery, and self-esteem and\r\n well-being. The DVIEP databases maintained on households at each of\r\n the three participating Police Service Areas (PSAs) were searched to\r\n identify new police reports of elder abuse for households in the\r\n sample within 12 months following the trigger incident. Variables from\r\n the DVIEP databases include age, race, ethnicity, and sex of the\r\n victim and the perpetrator, relationship of perpetrator to victim,\r\n type of abuse reported, charge, whether an arrest was made, if an\r\n order of protection had been obtained, if the order of protection was\r\n violated, use of weapons, if the victim had been injured, and if the\r\n victim was taken to the hospital. Several time lapse variables between\r\ndifferent time points are also provided.",

+            "description": "This project consisted of an evaluation of an elder abuse\r\n program run by the New York Police Department and Victim Services\r\n Research. The focus of the study was domestic elder abuse, which\r\n generally refers to any of several forms of maltreatment, physical\r\n abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and/or financial\r\n exploitation of an older person. The program, conducted in New York\r\n City public housing, had two complementary parts. First, public\r\n housing projects in Manhattan were assigned to one of two levels of\r\n public education (i.e., to receive or not to receive educational\r\n materials about elder abuse). Once the public education treatment had\r\n been implemented, 403 older adult residents of the housing projects\r\n who reported elder abuse to the police during the next ten months were\r\n assigned to one of two levels of follow-up to the initial police\r\n response (i.e., to receive or not to receive a home visit) as the\r\n second part of the project. The home visit intervention consisted of a\r\n strong law enforcement response designed to prevent repeat incidents\r\n of elder abuse. A team from the Domestic Violence Intervention and\r\n Education Program (DVIEP), consisting of a police officer and a social\r\n worker, followed up on domestic violence complaints with a home visit\r\n within a few days of the initial patrol response. Victims were\r\n interviewed about new victimizations following the intervention on\r\n three occasions: six weeks after the trigger incident, six months\r\n after the trigger incident, and twelve months after the trigger\r\n incident. Interviews at the three time points were identical except\r\n for the omission of background information on the second and third\r\n interviews. Demographic data collected during the first interview\r\n included age, gender, ethnicity, education, employment, income, legal\r\n relationship with abuser, living situation, number of people in the\r\n household, and health. For each time point, data provide measures of\r\n physical, psychological, and financial abuse, knowledge of elder\r\n abuse, knowledge and use of social services, satisfaction with the\r\n police, assessment of service delivery, and self-esteem and\r\n well-being. The DVIEP databases maintained on households at each of\r\n the three participating Police Service Areas (PSAs) were searched to\r\n identify new police reports of elder abuse for households in the\r\n sample within 12 months following the trigger incident. Variables from\r\n the DVIEP databases include age, race, ethnicity, and sex of the\r\n victim and the perpetrator, relationship of perpetrator to victim,\r\n type of abuse reported, charge, whether an arrest was made, if an\r\n order of protection had been obtained, if the order of protection was\r\n violated, use of weapons, if the victim had been injured, and if the\r\n victim was taken to the hospital. Several time lapse variables between\r\ndifferent time points are also provided.",

-            "description": "This study collected data on felony sentencing practices in\r\n the District of Columbia during the period 1993 to 1998. Data are\r\n provided on (1) the characteristics of felons sentenced by the\r\n District of Columbia Superior Court (DCSC), (2) the types, lengths,\r\n and variations of sentences imposed, (3) the length of time served in\r\n prison by those committed into the DC Department of Corrections\r\n (DCDOC), and (4) parole release decisions. And the study also\r\n attempted to assess the potential effects of new sentencing practices\r\n implemented in response to the National Capital Revitalization and\r\n Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 and the Truth in Sentencing\r\n Amendment Act of 1998. Data were obtained from several DC criminal\r\n justice agencies, including DC Superior Court, the Pretrial Services\r\n Agency, the DC Department of Corrections, and the DC Parole\r\n Commission. The records of individual defendants were linked across\r\n these databases to the extent possible, and an integrated database on\r\n felony case processing in the District was created in order to use the\r\n unique information from each system to create defendant-level or\r\n person-level records that contained more information about cases than\r\n could be obtained from any one system. The process also involved\r\n linking records within an agency's data system for the purposes of\r\n obtaining the history of contacts with an agency or for the purpose of\r\n aggregating charge-level information into summary data for a docket or\r\n commitment. The final database consists of three files. Part 1 (Felony\r\n Docket Data) includes sentencing information on all felony dockets\r\n sentenced in DCSC between January 1993 and December 1998. Part 2\r\n (Commitments Data) includes sentencing and time served information on\r\n all offenders who were committed to the DCDOC between January 1990 and\r\n December 1998. Part 3 (Decisions Data) includes all decisions made by\r\n the parole board on all types of considerations between January 1993\r\n and December 1998. Part 1 variables provide defendant demographic\r\n characteristics (including age, race, and sex), offense type codes\r\n (for the defendant's most serious offense), type of sentence (prison\r\n only, probation only, split, or fine) and the sentence imposed\r\n (including whether the defendant was sentenced to life). During the\r\n period under study, the District of Columbia followed an indeterminate\r\n sentencing system, and so the data file includes minimum and maximum\r\n periods where applicable (for example, confinement). The data include\r\n information pertaining to the most serious offense at conviction as\r\n well as aggregated sentence information on all felony charges on a\r\n docket (in case there were multiple charges). Part 2 variables include\r\n dates (of disposition, charging, and release), type of release from\r\n the DCDOC within that time period (including transfer to the Federal\r\n Bureau of Prisons facilities, release on parole, release upon\r\n completion of imposed term, transfer to escape status, and whether the\r\n offender had not yet been released by December 1998), in-prison parole\r\n hearing/decision information (including number of initial hearings,\r\n number of decisions, number of grants, and whether a parole release\r\n decision was granted at the initial hearing while on this commitment),\r\n prior criminal history (including number of prior prison sentences and\r\n the number of prior drug, violent, weapon, and property convictions in\r\n the last 15 years), current commitment sentencing information\r\n (including number of felony, misdemeanor, or split charges, most\r\n serious charge of conviction, and the sentence imposed on the most\r\n serious charge as well as the aggregate sentencing imposed on all\r\n charges of conviction), and the time served by the offender prior to\r\n release (with and without the amount of credit given for jail time\r\n prior to conviction). This file also identifies several problem flags\r\n that need to be taken into account before analyzing the data in order\r\n to select out problem cases (with data entry or computation\r\n errors). Part 3 variables include the date (year, month) of the\r\n hearing, up to four considerations being decided on, up to six\r\n decisions that were made for these considerations, six flags\r\n indicating the types of considerations that were included in the\r\n hearing, and two flags indicating the types of decisions that were\r\nincluded in the current hearing.",

Data are\r\n provided on (1) the characteristics of felons sentenced by the\r\n District of Columbia Superior Court (DCSC), (2) the types, lengths,\r\n and variations of sentences imposed, (3) the length of time served in\r\n prison by those committed into the DC Department of Corrections\r\n (DCDOC), and (4) parole release decisions. And the study also\r\n attempted to assess the potential effects of new sentencing practices\r\n implemented in response to the National Capital Revitalization and\r\n Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 and the Truth in Sentencing\r\n Amendment Act of 1998. Data were obtained from several DC criminal\r\n justice agencies, including DC Superior Court, the Pretrial Services\r\n Agency, the DC Department of Corrections, and the DC Parole\r\n Commission. The records of individual defendants were linked across\r\n these databases to the extent possible, and an integrated database on\r\n felony case processing in the District was created in order to use the\r\n unique information from each system to create defendant-level or\r\n person-level records that contained more information about cases than\r\n could be obtained from any one system. The process also involved\r\n linking records within an agency's data system for the purposes of\r\n obtaining the history of contacts with an agency or for the purpose of\r\n aggregating charge-level information into summary data for a docket or\r\n commitment. The final database consists of three files. Part 1 (Felony\r\n Docket Data) includes sentencing information on all felony dockets\r\n sentenced in DCSC between January 1993 and December 1998. Part 2\r\n (Commitments Data) includes sentencing and time served information on\r\n all offenders who were committed to the DCDOC between January 1990 and\r\n December 1998. Part 3 (Decisions Data) includes all decisions made by\r\n the parole board on all types of considerations between January 1993\r\n and December 1998.

The\r\n link between individual economic distress and community-level economic\r\n disadvantage raises the possibility that these two conditions may\r\n combine or interact in important ways to influence the risk of\r\n intimate violence against women. This study examined whether the\r\n effect of economic distress on intimate violence was stronger in\r\n disadvantaged or advantaged neighborhoods or was unaffected by\r\n neighborhood conditions. This project was a secondary analysis of data\r\n drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Survey of Families and\r\n Households (NSFH) and from the 1990 United States Census. From the\r\n NSFH, the researchers abstracted data on conflict and violence among\r\n couples, as well as data on their economic resources and well-being,\r\n the composition of the household in which the couple lived, and a\r\n large number of socio-demographic characteristics of the sample\r\n respondents. From the 1990 Census, the researchers abstracted\r\n tract-level data on the characteristics of the census tracts in which\r\n the NSFH respondents lived. Demographic information contains each\r\n respondent's race, sex, age, education, income, relationship status at\r\n Wave 1, marital status at Wave 1, cohabitation status, and number of\r\n children under 18. Using variables abstracted from both Wave 1 and\r\n Wave 2 of the NSFH and the 1990 Census, the researchers constructed\r\n new variables, including degree of financial worry and satisfaction\r\n for males and females, number of job strains, number of debts, changes\r\n in debts between Wave 1 and Wave 2, changes in income between Wave 1\r\n and Wave 2, if there were drinking and drug problems in the household,\r\n if the female was injured, number of times the female was victimized,\r\n the seriousness of the violence, if the respondent at Wave 2 was still\r\nat the Wave 1 address, and levels of community disadvantage.",

To accomplish this, the principal\r\n investigator conducted a survey of police and prosecutor agencies\r\n across the country to determine how stalking laws were being\r\n implemented. While there had been significant federal support for\r\n state and local agencies to adopt anti-stalking laws and implement\r\n anti-stalking initiatives, no comprehensive review of the status of\r\n such efforts had been done. Thus, there had been no way of knowing\r\n what additional measures might be needed to enhance local\r\n anti-stalking efforts. Two national surveys on stalking were\r\n conducted. The first survey of 204 law enforcement agencies (Part 1,\r\n Initial Law Enforcement Survey Data) and 222 prosecution offices (Part\r\n 3, Initial Prosecutor Survey Data) in jurisdictions with populations\r\n over 250,000 was conducted by mail in November of 1998. The survey\r\n briefly asked what special efforts the agencies had undertaken against\r\n stalking, including special units, training, or written policies and\r\n procedures. A replication of the first national survey was conducted\r\n in November of 2000. Part 2, Follow-Up Law Enforcement Survey Data,\r\n contains the follow-up data for law enforcement agencies and Part 4,\r\n Follow-Up Prosecutor Survey Data, contains the second survey data for\r\n prosecutors. Parts 1 to 4 include variables about the unit that\r\n handled stalking cases, types of stalking training provided, written\r\n policies on stalking cases, and whether statistics were collected on\r\n stalking and harassment. Parts 2 and 4 also include variables about\r\n the type of funding received by agencies. Part 4 also contains\r\n variables about other charges that might be filed in stalking cases,\r\n such as harassment, threats, criminal trespass, and protection order\r\nviolation.",

To accomplish this, the principal\r\n investigator conducted a survey of police and prosecutor agencies\r\n across the country to determine how stalking laws were being\r\n implemented. While there had been significant federal support for\r\n state and local agencies to adopt anti-stalking laws and implement\r\n anti-stalking initiatives, no comprehensive review of the status of\r\n such efforts had been done. Thus, there had been no way of knowing\r\n what additional measures might be needed to enhance local\r\n anti-stalking efforts. Two national surveys on stalking were\r\n conducted. The first survey of 204 law enforcement agencies (Part 1,\r\n Initial Law Enforcement Survey Data) and 222 prosecution offices (Part\r\n 3, Initial Prosecutor Survey Data) in jurisdictions with populations\r\n over 250,000 was conducted by mail in November of 1998. The survey\r\n briefly asked what special efforts the agencies had undertaken against\r\n stalking, including special units, training, or written policies and\r\n procedures. A replication of the first national survey was conducted\r\n in November of 2000. Part 2, Follow-Up Law Enforcement Survey Data,\r\n contains the follow-up data for law enforcement agencies and Part 4,\r\n Follow-Up Prosecutor Survey Data, contains the second survey data for\r\n prosecutors. Parts 1 to 4 include variables about the unit that\r\n handled stalking cases, types of stalking training provided, written\r\n policies on stalking cases, and whether statistics were collected on\r\n stalking and harassment. Parts 2 and 4 also include variables about\r\n the type of funding received by agencies. Part 4 also contains\r\n variables about other charges that might be filed in stalking cases,\r\n such as harassment, threats, criminal trespass, and protection order\r\nviolation.",

Two screening devices, or\r\n \"gatings,\" were used to predict future delinquency. The first\r\n procedure, triple gating, was based on teachers' ratings of school\r\n competence, mothers' reports of anti-social behavior in the home, and\r\n parental monitoring. The second procedure, double gating, used only\r\n the teachers' ratings and mothers' reports. Data were collected on the\r\n boys' family, school, and criminal backgrounds. Variables include\r\n measures of independence and achievement, family criminality, home\r\n conduct problems, school disruptiveness, school competence, parental\r\n authoritarianism, parental conflict, self-reported delinquency, peer\r\ndelinquency, and drug and alcohol use.",

To identify high-risk individuals,\r\nyouths in a Tampa juvenile detention center were given urine tests and\r\nwere asked a series of questions about past sexual and/or physical\r\nabuse. Official record searches were also conducted 6, 12, and 18\r\nmonths afterward to measure later encounters with the juvenile or\r\ncriminal justice systems. The investigators used the youths' urine\r\ntest results as the primary measure of drug use. On the basis of their\r\nreview of Florida's statutes, the investigators developed outcome\r\nmeasures for the following offense categories: violent felonies\r\n(murder/manslaughter, robbery, sex offenses, aggravated assault),\r\nproperty felonies (arson, burglary, auto theft, larceny/theft, stolen\r\nproperty offenses, damaging property offenses), drug felonies (drug\r\noffenses), violent misdemeanors (sex offenses, nonaggravated assault),\r\nproperty misdemeanors (larceny/theft, stolen property offenses,\r\ndamaging property offenses), drug misdemeanors (drug offenses), and\r\npublic disorder misdemeanors (public disorder offenses, trespassing\r\noffenses).

To identify high-risk individuals,\r\nyouths in a Tampa juvenile detention center were given urine tests and\r\nwere asked a series of questions about past sexual and/or physical\r\nabuse. Official record searches were also conducted 6, 12, and 18\r\nmonths afterward to measure later encounters with the juvenile or\r\ncriminal justice systems. The investigators used the youths' urine\r\ntest results as the primary measure of drug use. On the basis of their\r\nreview of Florida's statutes, the investigators developed outcome\r\nmeasures for the following offense categories: violent felonies\r\n(murder/manslaughter, robbery, sex offenses, aggravated assault),\r\nproperty felonies (arson, burglary, auto theft, larceny/theft, stolen\r\nproperty offenses, damaging property offenses), drug felonies (drug\r\noffenses), violent misdemeanors (sex offenses, nonaggravated assault),\r\nproperty misdemeanors (larceny/theft, stolen property offenses,\r\ndamaging property offenses), drug misdemeanors (drug offenses), and\r\npublic disorder misdemeanors (public disorder offenses, trespassing\r\noffenses).

-            "description": "The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\r\n (PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,\r\n schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent\r\n development. One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort\r\n Study, which was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that\r\n followed over 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young\r\n adults, and their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing\r\n circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,\r\n that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial\r\n behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One of\r\n the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Child\r\n Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL protocol, administered to parents\r\n or primary caregivers, was first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and\r\n has been one of the most widely-used standardized measures in child\r\n psychology for evaluating maladaptive behavioral and emotional\r\n problems in preschool subjects aged 2 to 3 or in subjects between the\r\n ages of 4 and 18. One version of the CBCL was administered to primary\r\n caregivers of subjects belonging to Cohort 0, while another version\r\n was administered to primary caregivers of subjects belonging to\r\n Cohorts 3-15 of the Longitudinal Cohort Study.

One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort\r\n Study, which was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that\r\n followed over 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young\r\n adults, and their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing\r\n circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,\r\n that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial\r\n behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One of\r\n the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Child\r\n Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL protocol, administered to parents\r\n or primary caregivers, was first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and\r\n has been one of the most widely-used standardized measures in child\r\n psychology for evaluating maladaptive behavioral and emotional\r\n problems in preschool subjects aged 2 to 3 or in subjects between the\r\n ages of 4 and 18. One version of the CBCL was administered to primary\r\n caregivers of subjects belonging to Cohort 0, while another version\r\n was administered to primary caregivers of subjects belonging to\r\n Cohorts 3-15 of the Longitudinal Cohort Study. Both versions assessed\r\n internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressive, and overcontrolled) and\r\n externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactive, noncompliant, and\r\n undercontrolled) behaviors.

The parent-report instrument is\r\n complemented by the subject self-report instrument, PROJECT ON HUMAN\r\n DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): MY EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE\r\n(SUBJECT), WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13617).",

The lever-pulling strategy was a foundational element of many collaborative partnerships across the country and it was a central element of the strategic plans of many Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) jurisdictions. This effort attempted to deter the future violent behavior of chronic offenders by first communicating directly to them about the impact that violence had on the community and the implementation of new efforts to respond to it, and then giving credibility to this communication effort by using all available legal sanctions (i.e., levers) against these offenders when violence occurred. The purpose of the study was to perform an experimental evaluation of a lever-pulling strategy implemented in Indianapolis, Indiana. Probationers were randomly assigned to the law enforcement focused lever-pulling group, the community leader lever-pulling group, or a regular probation control group during six months between June 2003 and March 2004. There were a total of 540 probationers in the study--180 probationers in each group. Probationers in the law enforcement focused lever-pulling group had face-to-face meetings with federal and local law enforcement officials and primarily received a deterrence-based message, but community officials also discussed various types of job and treatment opportunities. In contrast, probationers in the community leader lever-pulling group attended meetings with community leaders and service providers who exclusively focused on the impact of violence on the community and available services. Three types of data were collected to assess perceptions about the meeting: offending behavior, program participation behavior, and the levers pulled. First, data were collected using a self-report survey instrument (Part 1). Second, the complete criminal history for probationers (Part 2) was collected one-year after their meeting date. Third, all available probation data (Part 3) were collected 365 days after the meeting date. Part 1, Self-Report Survey Data, includes a total of 316 variables related to the following three types of data: Section I: meeting evaluation and perception of risk, Section II: Self-reported offense and gun use behavior, and Section III: Demographics. Part 2, Criminal History Data, includes a total of 94 variables collected about the probationer's complete offending history as well as their criminal activities after the treatment for one year. Part 3, Probation Data, includes a total of 249 variables related to probation history and other outcome data.",

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency and consequences of sexual assault within abusive intimate relationships, specific to ethnicity and immigrant status, and compare the findings to a similar group of physically abused women who had not experienced intimate partner sexual assault. Research objectives included a description of the type, extent, and temporal sequencing of sexual assault, consequences of sexual assault on women's health and their children's functioning, and treatments used by women to end the sexual assault. This study follows an earlier study on the effectiveness of protection orders that began in January 2001 at a special family violence unit of the Harris County District Attorney's office in Houston, Texas. That study was called EVALUATING A COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTION BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, 2001-2002 (ICPSR 3542). Among the initial cohort of 150 women, 148 women were alive in January 2003 and signed informed consent for the second study. Data from the first study on effectiveness of protection orders were re-stratified to measure differences between sexually abused and not-sexually abused women. Instruments used in the re-stratified analysis included instruments from the earlier study: a Demographic Data Form, Severity of Violence against Women Scales (SAVAWS), the Stalking Victimization Survey, the Danger Assessment Scale, a Worksite Harassment survey, and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form (SF-12) Health Survey, as well the addition of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Global Severity Index, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (PTSD), the Family Hardiness Index (FHI), the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL.). The data include responses from 35 children to the CBCL.  The variables in this study also include the frequency of use and the effectiveness of social agencies used in 2002. Additional questions asked about type and frequency of decision-making and actions regarding sexual relations, condom use, and birth control. Women physically but not sexually assaulted were asked a series of questions regarding whether they had ever worried about sexual assault. A series of questions was asked regarding children being witness to physical abuse. A detailed history of perpetrator behavior at the time of the first and additional sexual assaults was obtained, as well as victim helpseeking and health problems following the sexual assault(s). There was also a series of questions regarding the health effects of forced sex on the victim.",

Research objectives included a description of the type, extent, and temporal sequencing of sexual assault, consequences of sexual assault on women's health and their children's functioning, and treatments used by women to end the sexual assault. This study follows an earlier study on the effectiveness of protection orders that began in January 2001 at a special family violence unit of the Harris County District Attorney's office in Houston, Texas. That study was called EVALUATING A COLLABORATIVE INTERVENTION BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, 2001-2002 (ICPSR 3542). Among the initial cohort of 150 women, 148 women were alive in January 2003 and signed informed consent for the second study. Data from the first study on effectiveness of protection orders were re-stratified to measure differences between sexually abused and not-sexually abused women. Instruments used in the re-stratified analysis included instruments from the earlier study: a Demographic Data Form, Severity of Violence against Women Scales (SAVAWS), the Stalking Victimization Survey, the Danger Assessment Scale, a Worksite Harassment survey, and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form (SF-12) Health Survey, as well the addition of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Global Severity Index, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (PTSD), the Family Hardiness Index (FHI), the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL.). The data include responses from 35 children to the CBCL.  The variables in this study also include the frequency of use and the effectiveness of social agencies used in 2002. Additional questions asked about type and frequency of decision-making and actions regarding sexual relations, condom use, and birth control. Women physically but not sexually assaulted were asked a series of questions regarding whether they had ever worried about sexual assault. A series of questions was asked regarding children being witness to physical abuse. A detailed history of perpetrator behavior at the time of the first and additional sexual assaults was obtained, as well as victim helpseeking and health problems following the sexual assault(s). There was also a series of questions regarding the health effects of forced sex on the victim.",

The objectives were to determine how many women and men have experienced some form of violence in their lives either as children or adults, the factors associated with experiences of\r\nviolence, the consequences of violence, and the types of interactions with the justice system.  The survey sample was comprised of about 200 face-to-face interviews with homeless women in each of four Florida cities (Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, and Tampa). In all, 737 women were interviewed. In addition, 91 face-to-face interviews with homeless men were also conducted only in Orlando.  For Part 1 (Female Interviews), the data include information related to the respondent's living conditions in the past month, as well as experiences with homelessness, childhood violence, adult violence, forced sexual situations, and stalking.  Additional variables include basic demographic information, a self-report of criminal history, information related to how the respondent spent her days and evenings, and the physical environment surrounding the respondent during the day and evening.  For Part 2 (Male Interviews), the data include much of the same information as was collected in Part 1.  Information from Part 1 not included in Part 2 primarily includes questions pertaining to experience with forced sexual situations, and questions related to pregnancy and children.",

In addition, the study had two service-oriented objectives: (1) to educate students about various types of sexual assault, how they can maximize their safety, and what they can do if they or someone they know has been victimized and (2) to provide students with information about the campus and community resources that are available should they need assistance or have any concerns or questions.\r\nThe study involved a Web-based survey of random samples of undergraduate students at two large public universities, one located in the South (University 1) and one located in the Midwest (University 2).\r\nResearchers drew random samples of students aged 18-25 and enrolled at least three-quarters' time at each university to participate in the study. The survey was administered in the winter of 2005-2006, and a total of 5,446 undergraduate women and 1,375 undergraduate men participated for a grand total of 6,821 respondents. Sampled students were sent an initial recruitment e-mail that described the study, provided a unique study ID number, and included a hyperlink to the study Web site. During each of the following weeks, students who had not completed the survey were sent follow-up e-mails and a hard-copy letter encouraging them to participate.\r\nThe survey was administered anonymously and was designed to be completed in an average of 15 minutes. Respondents were provided with a survey completion code that, when entered with their study ID number at a separate Web site, enabled them to obtain a $10 Amazon.com gift certificate.\r\nThe survey was divided into six modules.\r\nThe Background Information module included survey items on demographics, school classification (year of study, year of enrollment, transfer status), residential characteristics, academic performance, and school involvement. An Alcohol and Other Drug Use module generated a number of measures of alcohol and drug use, and related substance use behaviors. A Dating module included items on sexual orientation, dating, consensual sexual activity, and dating violence. The Experiences module was developed after extensive reviews of past surveys of sexual assault and generated information on physically forced sexual assault and incapacitated sexual assault. For both physically forced and incapacitated sexual assault, information was collected on completed and attempted assaults experienced before entering college and since entering college. For male respondents, a Behaviors module asking about the perpetration of the same types of sexual assault covered in the Experiences module was included. The final module of the survey covered attitudes about sexual assault and attitudes about the survey. The data file contains 747 variables.",

All participants at the APP routinely underwent a standard intake procedure.  Data collection consisted of (1) an intake interview and questionnaires completed by the batterer at intake, (2) an initial telephone interview of the partner, (3) data collected from the batterer at mid-treatment and post-treatment, (4) data collected at the end of treatment on the number of sessions attended, and (5) telephone-based follow-up information received from the partner at 6 and 12 months post-intake.\r\nThe data file contains 550 cases and 901 variables.\r\nFor the Abuser Intake Interview, the abuser was asked information regarding his age, education, employment status, income, relationship to the victim partner, current contact, children in common, and history of abuse and trauma.  As part of this intake, the offender completed several instruments including (1) the Conflict Tactics Scales-Revised (CTS2), (2) the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), (3) the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), (4) the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), (5) the Generality of Violence-Revised (GVQ-R), (6) Perceptions of Procedural Justice, and (7) the Dissociative Violence Scale (DVS).\r\nThe victim partner was asked about demographics as well as relationship status, children in common, and current contact with the batterer.  As part of this interview, the victim partner also completed (1) the CTS2 items as they pertained to the batterer's behavior toward her in the previous six months and over the course of their relationship, (2) the Danger Assessment Scale (DAS), and (3) the Process of Change in Abused Women Scale (PROCAWS).\r\nAt 8 and 16 weeks into treatment, APP staff administered the Working Alliance Inventory -- Short Form (WAI-S) along with the Group Cohesion Scale (GES-COH).",

All participants at the APP routinely underwent a standard intake procedure.  Data collection consisted of (1) an intake interview and questionnaires completed by the batterer at intake, (2) an initial telephone interview of the partner, (3) data collected from the batterer at mid-treatment and post-treatment, (4) data collected at the end of treatment on the number of sessions attended, and (5) telephone-based follow-up information received from the partner at 6 and 12 months post-intake.\r\nThe data file contains 550 cases and 901 variables.\r\nFor the Abuser Intake Interview, the abuser was asked information regarding his age, education, employment status, income, relationship to the victim partner, current contact, children in common, and history of abuse and trauma.  As part of this intake, the offender completed several instruments including (1) the Conflict Tactics Scales-Revised (CTS2), (2) the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), (3) the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), (4) the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), (5) the Generality of Violence-Revised (GVQ-R), (6) Perceptions of Procedural Justice, and (7) the Dissociative Violence Scale (DVS).\r\nThe victim partner was asked about demographics as well as relationship status, children in common, and current contact with the batterer.  As part of this interview, the victim partner also completed (1) the CTS2 items as they pertained to the batterer's behavior toward her in the previous six months and over the course of their relationship, (2) the Danger Assessment Scale (DAS), and (3) the Process of Change in Abused Women Scale (PROCAWS).\r\nAt 8 and 16 weeks into treatment, APP staff administered the Working Alliance Inventory -- Short Form (WAI-S) along with the Group Cohesion Scale (GES-COH).",

-            "description": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the extent to which deterrence or cooperative strategies motivated firms and their facilities to comply with environmental regulations.  The project collected administrative data (secondary data) for a sample of publicly owned, United States companies in the pulp and paper, steel, and oil refining industries from 1995 to 2000 to track each firm's economic, environmental, and enforcement compliance history. Company Economic and Size Data (Part 1) from 1993 to 2000 were gathered from the Standard and Poor's Industrial Compustat, Mergent Online, and Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting in 512 company/year observations.  Next, the research team used the Directory of Corporate Affiliations, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), and the EPA's Permit Compliance System (PCS) to identify all facilities owned by the sample of firms between 1995 and 2000. Researchers then gathered Facility Ownership Data (Part 2), resulting in 15,408 facility/year observations.\r\nThe research team gathered various types of PCS data from the EPA for facilities in the sample. Permit Compliance System Facility Data (Part 3) were gathered on the 214 unique major National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued to facilities in the sample. Although permits were given to facilities, facilities could have one or more discharge points (e.g., pipes) that released polluted water directly into surface waters. Thus, Permit Compliance System Discharge Points (Pipe Layout) Data (Part 4) were also collected on 1,995 pipes.\r\nThe EPA determined compliance using two methods: inspections and evaluations/assessments. Permit Compliance System Inspections Data (Part 5) were collected on a total of 1,943 inspections.  Permit Compliance System Compliance Schedule Data (Part 6) were collected on a total of 3,336 compliance schedule events.  Permit Compliance System Compliance Schedule Violation Data (Part 7) were obtained for a total of 246 compliance schedule violations. Permit Compliance System Single Event Violations Data (Part 8) were collected on 75 single event violations.   Permit Compliance System Measurement/Effluent and Reporting Violations Data (Part 9) were collected for 396,479 violations.  Permit Compliance System Enforcement Actions Data (Part 10) were collected on 1,730 enforcement actions.\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration Data (Part 11) were collected on a total of 2,243 inspections. The OSHA data were collected by company name and include multiple facilities owned by each company and were not limited to facilities in the Permit Compliance System.  Additional information about firm noncompliance was drawn from EPA Docket and CrimDoc systems. Administrative and Judicial Docket Case Data (Part 12) were collected on 40 administrative and civil cases. Administrative and Judicial Docket Case Settlement Data (Part 13) were collected on 36 administrative and civil cases. Criminal Case Data (Part 14) were collected on three criminal cases.\r\nFor secondary data analysis purposes, the research team created the Yearly Final Report Data (Part 15) and the Quarterly Final Report Data (Part 16). The yearly data contain a total of 378 company/year observations; the quarterly data contain a total of 1,486 company/quarter observations.\r\nThe research team also conducted a vignette survey of the same set of companies that are in the secondary data to measure compliance and managerial decision-making. Concerning the Vignette Data (Part 17), a factorial survey was developed and administered to company managers tapping into perceptions of the costs and benefits of pro-social and anti-social conduct for themselves and their companies. A total of 114 respondents from 2 of the sampled corporations read and responded to a total of 384 vignettes representing 4 scenario types: technical noncompliance, significant noncompliance, over-compliance, and response to counter-terrorism.\r\nPart 1 contains 19 economic and size variables. Part 2 contains a total of eight variables relating to ownership. Part 3 contains 67 variables with regard to facility characteristics. Part 4 contains 31 variables relating to discharge points and pipe layout information. Part 5 contains 13 inspections characteristics variables. Part 6 contains 13 compliance schedule event characteristics variables. Part 7 contains 11 compliance schedule violation characteristics variables. Part 8 contains 10 single event violation characteristics variables. Part 9 contains 79 variables including variables for matching limits and discharge monitoring reports, actual limits (permitted levels) variables, standardized limits variables, statistical base codes variables, reported units on limits variables, units for standardized limits variables, sampling information variables, additional limits information, actual DMR reports for each limit, effluent violations, and variables relating to technical aspects of reporting. Part 10 contains 26 enforcement actions variables. Part 11 contains 24 Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspection variables. Part 12 contains 39 administrative and judicial court case characteristics variables. Part 13 contains 21 court case settlement characteristics variables. Part 14 contains 9 criminal case characteristics variables. Part 15 contains 95 variables created for final report analyses by year. Part 16 contains 46 variables created for final report analyses by quarter. Part 17 contains 157 variables including pro-social variables with security/over-compliance intentions, noncompliance variables with technical/significant noncompliance intentions, vignette characteristics variables, other variables derived from survey questions, environmental norms variables, and demographic characteristics variables.",

-            "description": "The purpose of the study was to examine criminal behavior and criminal justice system involvement among youth making the transition from out-of-home care to independent adulthood.  The study collected data from two sources: (1) survey data from the Midwest Study of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (Midwest Study), and (2) official arrest data. The Midwest Study was a longitudinal panel study that was part of a collaborative effort of the state public child welfare agencies in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, and the University of Washington. The participating states funded and/or operated the full range of services supported by the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.  The Midwest Study survey data were collected directly from the youth in the sample every two years over three waves, between May 2002 and January 2007. A total of 732 respondents participated in at least one of the in-person interviews over the three waves.  This data collection includes some variables that were directly measured from the original Midwest Study survey instrument and other variables that were computed or derived from variables in the original data for purposes of the current study.  To supplement the survey data, the research team accessed official arrest data from each state for this study.  Researchers obtained data on all criminal arrests that occurred between the respondents' Wave 1 interview and August 31, 2007, a date by which all of the study participants were at least 21 years old.  The study contains a total of 85 variables including indicator variables, demographic and background variables, delinquency and crime variables, out-of-home care experiences variables, and social bonds variables.",

SVORI was a goal-oriented initiative that specified outcomes that should be achieved by programs that were developed locally. The original Multi-site Evaluation of SVORI funded under NIJ grant 2004-RE-CX-0002 included a quasi-experimental  impact evaluation to determine the effectiveness of programming. Specifically, the purpose of the impact evaluation was to determine whether individuals who participated in enhanced reentry programming, as measured by their enrollment in SVORI programs, had improved post-release outcomes than comparable individuals who did not participate in SVORI programming. Impact evaluation data collection for both SVORI and non-SVORI participants consisted of four waves of in-person, computer-assisted interviews and oral swab drug tests conducted in conjunction with two of the follow-up interviews. The research team collected data on a total of 2,391 individuals including 1,697 adult males (Part 1), 357 adult females (Part 2), and 337 juvenile males (Part 3). As part of the impact evaluation, experienced RTI field interviewers conducted pre-release interviews with offenders approximately 30 days before release from prison and a series of follow-up interviews at 3, 9, and 15 months post-release. These data provided information on criminal history and recidivism occurring by December 31, 2007. The Adult Males Data (Part 1), Adult Females Data (Part 2), and the Juvenile Males Data (Part 3) each contain the same 5,566 variables from the 3 waves of offender interviews, 10 drug test lab results variables, and 3 weight variables. (Note: Some interview questions were only asked of adults, and other questions were only asked of juveniles.) Offender interview variables include demographics, housing, employment, education, military experience, family background, peer relationships, program operations and services, physical and mental health, substance abuse, crime and delinquency, and attitudes toward those topics. \r\n Under NIJ Grant 2009-IJ-CX-0010, the original Multi-site Evaluation of SVORI data were updated in order to examine the questions of, \"What works, for whom, and for how long?\" This included follow-up interview questions of those previously (and currently still) incarcerated. New variables derived from data collected under the original SVORI impact evaluation between 2004 and 2007 were also added to Part 3.

The central databases used in the study were the Offender Based Information System (OBIS), the Revocation Scheduling and Tracking System (RSTS), and the Statewide Parolee Database (SPDB). These three central databases provided information for the outcome variables of the study as well as information about parolees' personal characteristics, aspects of their supervision, and criminal histories. For the Parole Violations Data (Part 1), these data were combined with data extracted from several California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) data systems and connected to other pieces of data using administrative and geographic identifiers to construct measures of parole agent and community characteristics. Parole agent and parole policy measures were drawn from the California State Personnel Board Parole Agent Database (PACD) and California parole policies. Measures of community conditions were drawn from the 2000 United States Census, the United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the California Secretary of State, and the Religious Congregations and Membership Study, 2000.  A total of 13,070 parolees were observed for a maximum of 106 weeks during 2003-2004, yielding a total of 1,376,820 parolee-week observations for Part 1.  The Parole Revocations Data (Part 2) include every parole violation case that went through a county court or a parole board hearing in 2003 and 2004 -- a total of 151,586 cases. Individual, organizational, and community-level data were merged into the Part 2 dataset using administrative and geographic identifiers. Information about each parolee was extracted from several CDCR data systems. Similar to Part 1, the central databases used in Part 2 of the study were the OBIS and the RSTS. Organizational measures were drawn from CDCR Annual Population Reports, California Corrections Standards Authority Jail Profile Surveys, and Judicial Council of California Court Statistics Reports. Measures of community conditions were drawn from the 2000 United States Census, the SAMHSA, and the California Secretary of State.  The Parole Violations Data (Part 1) contain a total of 50 variables including past and present offense history variables, parolee characteristics, supervision characteristics, and community environment variables.  The Parole Revocations Data (Part 2) contain a total of 42 variables including case characteristics, individual characteristics, organizational factors, and community factors.",

The study used a quasi-experimental design to compare seven LEAs with CED deployment to a set of six matched LEAs that did not deploy CEDs on a variety of safety outcomes. From 2006-2008, data were collected on the details of every use of force incident during a specified time period (1992-2007), as well as demographic and crime statistics for each site. For the agencies that deployed CEDs, at least two years of data on use of force incidents were collected for the period before CED deployment and at least two years of data for the period after CED deployment. For the agencies that did not deploy CEDs, at least four years of data were collected over a similar period.",

The purpose of this evaluation was to explore the extent to which receiving supportive services at the Fortune Society improved clients' prospects for law abiding behavior. More specifically, this study examined the extent to which receipt of these services reduced recidivism and homelessness following release.  The research team adopted a quasi-experimental design that compared recidivism outcomes for persons enrolled at Fortune (clients) to persons released from New York State prisons and returning to New York City and, separately, inmates released from the New York City jails, none of whom went to Fortune (non-clients). All -- clients and non-clients alike -- were released after January 1, 2000, and before November 3, 2005 (for state prisoners), and March 3, 2005 (for city jail prisoners). Information about all prisoners released during these time frames was obtained from the New York State Department of Correctional Services for state prisoners and from the New York City Department of Correction for city prisoners. The research team also obtained records from the Fortune Society for its clients and arrest and conviction information for all released prisoners from the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' criminal history repository. These records were matched and merged, producing a 72,408 case dataset on 57,349 released state prisoners (Part 1) and a 68,614 case dataset on 64,049 city jail prisoners (Part 2).  The research team obtained data from the Fortune Society for 15,685 persons formally registered as clients between 1989 and 2006 (Part 3) and data on 416,943 activities provided to clients at the Fortune Society between September 1999 and March 2006 (Part 4). Additionally, the research team obtained 97,665 records from the New York City Department of Homeless Services of all persons who sought shelter or other homeless services during the period from January 2000 to July 2006 (Part 5). Part 6 contains 96,009 cases and catalogs matches between a New York State criminal record identifier and a Fortune Society client identifier.

The Fortune Society Client Data (Part 3) contain 44 variables including demographic, criminal history, needs/issues, and other variables. The Fortune Society Client Activity Data (Part 4) contain seven variables including two identifiers, end date, Fortune service unit, duration in hours, activity type, and activity. The Homelessness Events Data (Part 5) contain four variables including two identifiers, change in homeless status, and date of change. The New York State Criminal Record/Fortune Society Client Match Data (Part 6) contain four variables including three identifiers and a variable that indicates the type of match between a New York State criminal record identifier and a Fortune Society client identifier.",

In all, 227 client interviews with 227 corresponding staff questionnaires were compiled between 2007 and 2008, and scales were developed for measurements of both financial exploitation and psychological abuse.  Financial exploitation of the elderly was measured through variables related to theft, scams, coercion, signs of abuse or financial entitlement by trusted friends or family members, and money management difficulties.  Psychological abuse of the elderly was measured through variables related to isolation, disrespect, exploited vulnerability, shame, threats and intimidation, and risk factors related to the client's trusted friends or family.",

In all, 227 client interviews with 227 corresponding staff questionnaires were compiled between 2007 and 2008, and scales were developed for measurements of both financial exploitation and psychological abuse.  Financial exploitation of the elderly was measured through variables related to theft, scams, coercion, signs of abuse or financial entitlement by trusted friends or family members, and money management difficulties.  Psychological abuse of the elderly was measured through variables related to isolation, disrespect, exploited vulnerability, shame, threats and intimidation, and risk factors related to the client's trusted friends or family.",

Researchers performed hand searches of leading journals in the field and searched the Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women Web site for a listing of federally-funded second responded programs and any evaluations conducted on those programs. A total of 22 studies that discussed second responder programs were found by the research team. Of these, 12 were eliminated from the sample because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving a final sample of 10 studies. After collecting an electronic or paper copy of each article or report, researchers extracted pertinent data from each eligible article using a detailed coding protocol. Two main outcome measures were available for a sufficient number of studies to permit meta-analysis. One outcome was based on police data (Part 1: Police Data, n=9), for example whether a new domestic violence incident was reported to the police in the form of a crime report within six months of the triggering incident. The second outcome was based on survey data (Part 2: Interview Data, n=8), for example whether a new domestic violence incident occurred and  was reported to a researcher during an interview within six months of the triggering incident. Several of studies (n=7) included in the meta-analysis had both outcome measures.",

Several strategies were used to perform an exhaustive search for literature fitting the eligibility criteria. Researchers performed a keyword search on an array of online abstract databases, reviewed the bibliographies of past reviews of problem-oriented policing (POP), performed forward searches for works that have cited seminal problem-oriented policing studies, performed hand searches of leading journals in the field, searched the publication of several research and professional agencies, and emailed the list of studies meeting the eligibility criteria to leading policing scholars knowledgeable in the the area of problem-oriented policing to ensure relevant studies had not been missed. Both Part 1 (Pre-Post Study Data, n=52) and Part 2 (Quasi-Experimental Study Data, n=19) include variables in the following categories: reference information, nature and description of selection site, problems, etc., nature and description of selection of comparison group or period, unit of analysis, sample size, methodological type, description of the POP intervention, statistical test(s) used, reports of significance, effect size/power, and conclusions drawn by the authors.",

The following criteria were used for the inclusion of studies in the systematic review: the study described an evaluation of a program designed specifically to reduce school (kindergarten to high school) bullying; bullying was defined as including: physical, verbal, or psychological attack or intimidation that is intended to cause fear, distress, or harm to the victim; and an imbalance of power, with the more powerful child (or children) oppressing less powerful ones; bullying (specifically) was measured using self-report questionnaires, peer ratings, teacher ratings, or observational data; the effectiveness of the program was measured by comparing students who received it (the experimental condition) with a comparison group of students who did not receive it (the control condition). There must have been some control of extraneous variables in the evaluation by (1) randomization, or (2) pre-test measures of bulling, or (3) choosing some kind of comparable control condition; published and unpublished reports of research conducted in developed countries between 1983 and 2009 were included; and it was possible to measure the effect size. Several search strategies were used to identify 89 anti-bully studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in this review: researchers searched for the names of established researchers in the area of bullying prevention; researchers conducted a keyword search of 18 electronic databases; researchers conducted a manual search of 35 journals, either online or in print, from 1983 until the end of May 2009; and researchers sought information from key researchers on bullying and from international colleagues in the Campbell Collaboration.

A third aim of the review was to investigate whether associations between parental imprisonment and child outcomes differ according to child, parent, and environmental characteristics. Between June and September 2008, researchers searched for studies that met the eligibility criteria. Several strategies were used to conduct an exhaustive search for eligible studies. Researchers started with an existing set of documents collected by Joseph Murray during his previous research on the effects of parental imprisonment on children and then used three methods to search for additional studies. First, researchers searched 23 electronic databases for the years 1960-2008. The same keywords were used to search each database. Second, researchers examined bibliographies of previous reviews of studies on the effects of parental imprisonment on children. Third, researchers contacted experts in the field. Two groups of researchers and practitioners were emailed and asked to inform researchers of any studies they thought might be eligible for the review. The 16 studies included in the review were coded for the following key features: reference information, sample characteristics, details about the measure of parental imprisonment, details of subsamples, and multiple comparisons made in the study, details of the comparison group(s) used to derive effect sizes, types of outcome measured, and measurement details, methods used to control for confounding variables to estimate causal effects, methodological quality of the study for drawing conclusions about risk factors and causal risk factors, and statistical information used to derive an effect size.",

A third aim of the review was to investigate whether associations between parental imprisonment and child outcomes differ according to child, parent, and environmental characteristics. Between June and September 2008, researchers searched for studies that met the eligibility criteria. Several strategies were used to conduct an exhaustive search for eligible studies. Researchers started with an existing set of documents collected by Joseph Murray during his previous research on the effects of parental imprisonment on children and then used three methods to search for additional studies. First, researchers searched 23 electronic databases for the years 1960-2008. The same keywords were used to search each database. Second, researchers examined bibliographies of previous reviews of studies on the effects of parental imprisonment on children. Third, researchers contacted experts in the field. Two groups of researchers and practitioners were emailed and asked to inform researchers of any studies they thought might be eligible for the review. The 16 studies included in the review were coded for the following key features: reference information, sample characteristics, details about the measure of parental imprisonment, details of subsamples, and multiple comparisons made in the study, details of the comparison group(s) used to derive effect sizes, types of outcome measured, and measurement details, methods used to control for confounding variables to estimate causal effects, methodological quality of the study for drawing conclusions about risk factors and causal risk factors, and statistical information used to derive an effect size.",

This project conducted record reviews to verify the accuracy of the risk assessment scores and examined how scores on the Sex Offender Treatment Needs and Progress Scale (SOTNPS) and one or more of these static risk instruments can be combined into an overall model of risk assessment. An empirically derived decision-making model was created to assist correctional administrators, probation and parole officers, and treatment providers in allocating and delivering supervision and treatment services based on an individual's treatment needs and risk to sexually\r\nre-offend. Three hypotheses were tested. First, it was expected that one or more static risk measures (Static-99R, Static-2002R and VASOR) would predict sexual recidivism with moderate accuracy in the sample. Second, a dynamic risk measure, Sex Offender Treatment Needs and Progress Scale (SOTNPS), or a subset of risk factors contained in this measure would also predict sexual recidivism with moderate accuracy and be sensitive to the changes in dynamic risk over time. Third, a combined static and dynamic risk measure would predict sexual recidivism more accurate than either measure alone.",

Probation officers in the state of Rhode Island were surveyed a few weeks before and 18 months after the implementation of CSMS. A total of 56 probation officers participated in the first wave of the study (pre-implementation survey), and 52 probation officers participated in the second wave (post-implementation survey), yielding an overall sample size of 108 probation officers. Dataset 1 contains the data for both waves of the study. The dataset is comprised of 140 variables. Both waves of the study examined the following categories of variables: the probation officer's professional background, contact with clients, amount of time spent on job duties specific to the profession, contact with other agencies, and computer usage. The second wave added 86 variables to explore officers' experiences with CSMS, which features they used, how it impacted their work, and their expected use of CSMS in the future.",

Probation officers in the state of Rhode Island were surveyed a few weeks before and 18 months after the implementation of CSMS. A total of 56 probation officers participated in the first wave of the study (pre-implementation survey), and 52 probation officers participated in the second wave (post-implementation survey), yielding an overall sample size of 108 probation officers. Dataset 1 contains the data for both waves of the study. The dataset is comprised of 140 variables. Both waves of the study examined the following categories of variables: the probation officer's professional background, contact with clients, amount of time spent on job duties specific to the profession, contact with other agencies, and computer usage. The second wave added 86 variables to explore officers' experiences with CSMS, which features they used, how it impacted their work, and their expected use of CSMS in the future.",

The general goals of the process\r\n evaluation were to assess how and to what extent the State College\r\n Police Department's proposed activities were implemented as planned,\r\n based on the rationale that such activities would enhance the\r\n potential for increasing victim safety and perpetrator accountability\r\n systemically. As part of the grant, the police department sought to\r\n improve case tracking and services to victims by developing new\r\n specialized positions for domestic violence, including: (1) a domestic\r\n violence arrest coordinator from within the State College Police\r\n Department who was responsible for monitoring case outcomes through\r\n the courts and updating domestic violence policies and training (Part\r\n 1, Victim Tracking Data from Domestic Violence Coordinator), (2) a\r\n victims service attorney from Legal Services who was responsible for\r\n handling civil law issues for domestic violence victims, including\r\n support, child custody, employment, financial, consumer, public\r\n benefits, and housing issues (Part 2, Victim Tracking Data From Victim\r\n Services Attorney), and (3) an intensive domestic violence probation\r\n officer from the Centre County Probation and Parole Department who was\r\n responsible for providing close supervision and follow-up of batterers\r\n (Part 3, Offender Tracking Data). Researchers worked with\r\n practitioners to develop databases suitable for monitoring service\r\n provision by the three newly-created positions for domestic violence\r\n cases. Major categories of data collected on the victim tracking form\r\n (Parts 1 and 2) included location of initial contact, type of initial\r\n contact, referral source, reason for initial contact,\r\n service/consultation provided at initial contact, meetings, and\r\n referrals out. Types of services provided include reporting abuse,\r\n filing a Protection from Abuse order, legal representation, and\r\n assistance with court procedures. Major categories of data collected\r\n on the offender tracking form (Part 3) included location of initial\r\n contact, type of initial contact, referral source, reason for initial\r\n contact, service/consultation provided, charges, sentence received,\r\n relationship between the victim and perpetrator, marital status,\r\n children in the home, referrals out, presentencing investigation\r\n completed, prior criminal history, and reason for termination. Types\r\n of services provided include pre-sentence investigation, placement on\r\n supervision, and assessment and evaluation. In addition to developing\r\n these new positions, the police department also sought to improve how\r\n officers handled domestic violence cases through a two-day training\r\n program. The evaluation conducted pre- and post-training assessments\r\n of all personnel training in 1999 and conducted follow-up surveys to\r\n assess the long-term impact of training. For Part 4, Police Training\r\n Survey Data, surveys were administered to law enforcement personnel\r\n participating in a two-day domestic violence training program. Surveys\r\n were administered both before and after the training program and\r\n focused on knowledge about domestic violence policies and protocols,\r\n attitudes and beliefs about domestic violence, and the background and\r\n experience of the officers. Within six months after the training, the\r\n same participants were contacted to complete a follow-up survey.\r\n Variables in Part 4 measure how well officers knew domestic violence\r\n arrest policies, their attitudes toward abused women and how to handle\r\n domestic violence cases, and their opinions about\r\n training. Demographic variables in Part 4 include age, sex, race,\r\neducation, and years in law enforcement.",

-            "description": "This study examined the amount of force used by and against\r\nlaw enforcement officers and more than 50 characteristics of officers,\r\ncivilians, and arrest situations associated with the use of different\r\nlevels of force. An important component of this multijurisdiction\r\nproject was to employ a common measurement of elements of force and\r\npredictors of force. Data were gathered about suspects' and police\r\nofficers' behaviors from adult custody arrests in six urban law\r\nenforcement agencies. The participating agencies were the\r\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg (North Carolina) Police Department, Colorado\r\nSprings (Colorado) Police Department, Dallas (Texas) Police\r\nDepartment, St. Petersburg (Florida) Police Department, San Diego\r\n(California) Police Department, and San Diego County (California)\r\nSheriff's Department. Data collection began at different times in the\r\nparticipating departments, so the total sample included arrests during\r\nthe summer, fall, and winter of 1996-1997. Forms were completed and\r\ncoded for 7,512 adult custody arrests (Part 1). This form was used to\r\nrecord officer self-reports on the characteristics of the arrest\r\nsituation, the suspects, and the officers, and the specific behavioral\r\nacts of officers, suspects, and bystanders in a particular\r\narrest. Similar items were asked of 1,156 suspects interviewed in\r\nlocal jails at the time they were booked following arrest to obtain an\r\nindependent assessment of officer and suspect use of force (Part\r\n2). Officers were informed that some suspects would be interviewed,\r\nbut they did not know which would be interviewed or when. Using the\r\nitems included on the police survey, the research team constructed\r\nfour measures of force used by police officers -- physical force,\r\nphysical force plus threats, continuum of force, and maximum\r\nforce. Four comparable measures of force used by arrested suspects\r\nwere also developed. These measures are included in the data for Part\r\n1. Each measure was derived by combining specific actions by law\r\nenforcement officers or by suspects in various ways. The first measure\r\nwas a traditional conceptual dichotomy of arrests in which physical\r\nforce was or was not used. For both the police and for suspects, the\r\ndefinition of physical force included any arrest in which a weapon or\r\nweaponless tactic was used. In addition, police arrests in which\r\nofficers used a severe restraint were included. The second measure,\r\nphysical force plus threats, was similar to physical force but added\r\nthe use of threats and displays of weapons. To address the potential\r\nlimitations of these two dichotomous measures, two other measures were\r\ndeveloped. The continuum-of-force measure captured the levels of force\r\ncommonly used in official policies by the participating law\r\nenforcement agencies. To construct the fourth measure, maximum force,\r\n503 experienced officers in five of the six jurisdictions ranked a\r\nvariety of hypothetical types of force by officers and by suspects on\r\na scale from 1 (least forceful) to 100 (most forceful). Officers were\r\nasked to rank these items based on their own personal experience, not\r\nofficial policy. These rankings of police and suspect use of force,\r\nwhich appear in Part 3, were averaged for each jurisdiction and used\r\nin Part 1 to weight the behaviors that occurred in the sampled\r\narrests. Variables for Parts 1 and 2 include nature of the arrest,\r\nfeatures of the arrest location, mobilization of the police, and officer\r\nand suspect characteristics. Part 3 provides officer rankings on 54\r\nitems that suspects might do or say during an arrest. Separately,\r\nofficers ranked a series of 44 items that a police officer might do or\r\nsay during an arrest. These items include spitting, shouting or\r\ncursing, hitting, wrestling, pushing, resisting, fleeing, commanding,\r\nusing conversational voice, and using pressure point holds, as well as\r\npossession, display, threat of use, or use of several weapons (e.g.,\r\nknife, chemical agent, dog, blunt object, handgun, motor vehicle).",

First, researchers\r\n wanted to assess the benefits of the driving while intoxicated (DWI)\r\n drug court established in the Las Cruces, New Mexico, Municipal Court\r\n in an effort to determine its future viability. This was accomplished\r\n by examining the behaviors and attitudes of three groups of convicted\r\n drunk-drivers and determining the extent to which these groups were\r\n different or similar. The three groups included: (1) non-alcoholic\r\n first- and second-time offenders (non-alcoholic offenders), (2)\r\n alcoholic first- and second-time DWI offenders (alcoholic offenders),\r\n and (3) chronic three-time (or more) DWI offenders (chronic\r\n offenders). The second purpose of this study was to explore police\r\n officers' attitudes toward court-based treatment programs for DWI\r\n offenders, while examining the distinguishing characteristics between\r\n police officers who support court-based programs for drunk drivers and\r\n those who are less likely to support such sanctions. Data for Part 1,\r\n Drug Court Survey Data, were collected using a survey questionnaire\r\n distributed to non-alcoholic, alcoholic, and chronic offenders. Part 1\r\n variables include blood alcohol level, jail time, total number of\r\n prior arrests and convictions, the level of support from the\r\n respondents' family and friends, and whether the respondent thought\r\n DWI was wrong, could cause injury, or could ruin lives. Respondents\r\n were also asked whether they acted spontaneously in general, took\r\n risks, found trouble exciting, ever assaulted anyone, ever destroyed\r\n property, ever extorted money, ever sold or used drugs, thought lying\r\n or stealing was OK, ever stole a car, attempted breaking and entering,\r\n or had been a victim of extortion. Demographic variables for Part 1\r\n include the age, gender, race, and marital status of each\r\n respondent. Data for Part 2, Police Officer Survey Data, were\r\n collected using a survey questionnaire designed to capture what police\r\n officers knew about the DWI Drug Court, where they learned about it,\r\n and what factors accounted for their attitudes toward the program.\r\n Variables for Part 2 include police officers' responses to whether DWI\r\n court was effective, whether DWI laws were successful, the perceived\r\n effect of mandatory jail time versus treatment alone, major problems\r\n seen with DWI policies, if DWI was considered dangerous, and how the\r\n officer had learned or been briefed about the drug court. Other\r\n variables include the number of DWI arrests, and whether respondents\r\n believed that reforms weaken police power, that DWI caused more work\r\n for them, that citizens have bad attitudes, that the public has too\r\n many rights, and that stiffer penalties for DWI offenders were more\r\nsuccessful.",

The purposes of the study were (1) to analyze\r\n the nature and circumstances of incidents of felonious police killings\r\n and (2) to analyze trends in the numbers and rates of killings across\r\n different types of agencies and to explain these differences. For Part\r\n 1, Incident-Level Data, an incident-level database was created to\r\n capture all incidents involving the death of a police officer from\r\n 1983 through 1992. Data on officers and incidents were collected from\r\n the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) data\r\n collection as coded by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. In\r\n addition to the UCR data, the Police Foundation also coded information\r\n from the LEOKA narratives that are not part of the computerized LEOKA\r\n database from the FBI. For Part 2, Agency-Level Data, the researchers\r\n created an agency-level database to research systematic differences\r\n among rates at which law enforcement officers had been feloniously\r\n killed from 1977 through 1992. The investigators focused on the 56\r\n largest law enforcement agencies because of the availability of data\r\n for explanatory variables. Variables in Part 1 include year of\r\n killing, involvement of other officers, if the officer was killed with\r\n his/her own weapon, circumstances of the killing, location of fatal\r\n wounds, distance between officer and offender, if the victim was\r\n wearing body armor, if different officers were killed in the same\r\n incident, if the officer was in uniform, actions of the killer and of\r\n the officer at entry and final stage, if the killer was visible at\r\n first, if the officer thought the killer was a felon suspect, if the\r\n officer was shot at entry, and circumstances at anticipation, entry,\r\n and final stages. Demographic variables for Part 1 include victim's\r\n sex, age, race, type of assignment, rank, years of experience, agency,\r\n population group, and if the officer was working a security job. Part\r\n 2 contains variables describing the general municipal environment,\r\n such as whether the agency is located in the South, level of poverty\r\n according to a poverty index, population density, percent of\r\n population that was Hispanic or Black, and population aged 15-34 years\r\n old. Variables capturing the crime environment include the violent\r\n crime rate, property crime rate, and a gun-related crime\r\n index. Lastly, variables on the environment of the police agencies\r\n include violent and property crime arrests per 1,000 sworn officers,\r\n percentage of officers injured in assaults, and number of sworn\r\nofficers.",

-            "description": "This study was a process evaluation of the three\r\nresidential substance abuse treatment programs in the state of\r\nOhio. These programs include MonDay Community Correctional Institution\r\n(MonDay), Mohican Youth Center, and Noble Choices. MonDay is a locally\r\noperated, community-based correctional facility for felony offenders\r\nto which male and female offenders are sentenced in lieu of prison for\r\na period not to exceed six months. MonDay's RSAT program began in\r\nOctober 1997, and a Therapeutic Community (TC) was fully implemented\r\nby January 1, 1998. Offenders identified as needing long-term\r\nresidential treatment were assigned to MonDay's RSAT for six\r\nmonths. Mohican Youth Center (MYC) is an institutional-based TC and is\r\noperated by the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Youth convicted of\r\nfelonies and assessed as needing long-term residential substance abuse\r\ntreatment are sent to MYC for the last six months of their\r\nsentence. Noble Choices is a TC for adult males within the Noble\r\nCorrectional Institution, a medium security prison operated by the\r\nOhio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections. The specific\r\nresearch questions addressed in this study were: (1) What is the\r\nprofile of offenders being served by the Ohio RSAT programs? (2) What\r\nis the nature of the services being delivered by the Ohio RSAT\r\nprograms? (3) What are the intermediate outcomes of Ohio RSAT\r\nprograms? (4) How are offenders performing under post-release\r\nsupervision in terms of relapse and recidivism? and (5) What factors\r\nare associated with successful program completion and post-release\r\nrecidivism and relapse? A one-group post-test design was used to\r\nconduct this process evaluation. Each program was studied as a\r\nseparate entity. The study period for each program began at the date\r\nof first admission, which was January 1, 1998, for MonDay, March 3,\r\n1998, for MYC, and October 18, 1998, for Noble Choices. The study\r\nperiod ended on March 31, 1999, for MYC and Noble Choices and on April\r\n30, 1999, for MonDay. The sample consists of 466 individuals,\r\nincluding 90 from MonDay, 343 from MYC, and 33 from Noble\r\nChoices. Staff at each of the three sites collected intake, treatment,\r\nand termination data on their respective program clients using\r\nstandardized forms developed by the University of Cincinnati. The\r\nintake form was used to collect basic demographic information on each\r\noffender along with information on past substance abuse, prior\r\ntreatment experiences, and criminal history. The termination form\r\ncollected data on type of termination (successful or unsuccessful) and\r\ncriminal justice placement and residency upon termination. Each site\r\nalso provided agency-specific assessment information on each\r\noffender. Offenders at MonDay were given the Level of Services\r\nInventory (LSI), which measures the risk of recidivism, and the Adult\r\nSubstance Use Survey (ASUS), which measures the severity of substance\r\nabuse problems. Offenders at MYC were administered the Juvenile\r\nAutomated Substance Abuse Evaluation (JASAE), which measures the\r\nseverity of substance abuse problems, and the Youthful Offender Level\r\nof Services Inventory (YO-LSI). Offenders at Noble Choices were given\r\nthe Prison Inmate Inventory (PII), which measures several risk\r\nfactors. In addition, offenders at MonDay and MYC were given the\r\nPersonal Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQ), which measures motivation for\r\ntreatment at intake and 90 days after intake, and offenders at MonDay\r\nalso completed the PDUQ upon termination. Offenders at MonDay were\r\nalso administered a Client Self-Rating Form, which measures levels of\r\nsocial and psychological functioning, at intake, 90 days after intake,\r\nand termination. Follow-up forms were sent to probation and parole\r\nofficers to collect information on MYC and MonDay offenders' treatment\r\nand supervision activities during the period of supervision after\r\nrelease from the program. Follow-up data were collected on terminated\r\ncases from the date of release until August 30, 1999. Part 1, MonDay\r\nData, consists of data from the LSI, ASUS, and intake, termination,\r\nand follow-up forms for offenders at MonDay. The LSI scores provided\r\nare: criminal history, employment, financial, family, accommodation,\r\nleisure and recreation, companion, alcohol and drug, emotions,\r\nattitude/orientation, and total. The ASUS variable measures severity\r\nof substance abuse problems and distinguishes between scores of 74 or\r\nless and 75 or higher. The intake form provides demographic variables,\r\nemployment status prior to arrest, variables related to the current\r\noffense, date screened for RSAT, date placed in RSAT, criminal\r\nhistory, and substance use history. The discharge form provides\r\nvariables on date of discharge, type of discharge, living arrangements\r\nupon discharge, whether continued drug/alcohol treatment was arranged\r\nfor client, and criminal justice placement. The follow-up form\r\nprovides variables on substance abuse treatment after release, other\r\nservices received after release, employment status, reporting status,\r\ndrug and alcohol tests after release, whether the offender was\r\narrested after release and for what offense, whether a conviction\r\nresulted, and the offender's probation status. Several derived\r\nvariables are also supplied in Part 1. Part 2, MonDay Client Self\r\nRating Scales Data, includes the offender's date of placement, date of\r\nbirth, the three dates on which the questionnaire was administered,\r\nwhether inconsistencies appeared in answers to the questionnaires, and\r\nseveral scales derived from offenders' answers. These scales, which\r\nare provided for each of the three occasions the questionnaire was\r\nadministered, include measures of anxiety, depression, self-esteem,\r\ndecision-making, risk-taking, hostility, self-efficacy, and antisocial\r\nattitudes. Several derived variables are also included. Part 3, MonDay\r\nPersonal Drug Use Data, consists of variables from MonDay's\r\nPDUQ. Scales and answers to the 20 items on the PDUQ questionnaire are\r\nprovided for all three administrations of the questionnaire. In Part\r\n4, Mohican Data, variables from the MYC intake, termination, and\r\nfollow-up forms are identical to those from the MonDay forms except\r\nfor additional intake variables on whether the youth was in school\r\nprior to arrest, whether the youth experienced certain school\r\nproblems, where the youth was living prior to arrest, and whether the\r\nyouth had a record of running away from home. Variables provide the\r\nJASAE summary score, date of YO-LSI administration, and YO-LSI scores\r\nin the categories of criminal history, family, education, peer,\r\nsubstance abuse, leisure and recreation, personality and behavior,\r\nattitudes/orientation, and total. For each YO-LSI score category an\r\nadditional variable is provided that indicates whether the score was\r\nlow, moderate, or high. Several derived variables are also\r\nprovided. Part 5, Mohican Personal Drug Use Data, consists of scale\r\nvariables calculated from responses to the MYC PDUQ for both\r\nadministrations of the questionnaire. These scales are\r\nprecontemplation, contemplation, determination, action, and\r\nmaintenance. Part 6, Noble Data, consists of variables from Noble\r\nChoices intake, termination, and PII questionnaires. Variables from\r\nthe intake and termination forms are identical to those taken from the\r\nMonDay intake and termination forms. Variables from the PII include\r\nscale variables that measure truthfulness, adjustment, judgment,\r\nalcohol, drug, antisocial attitudes, violence, distress, self-esteem,\r\nand stress. For each of these scales an additional variable is\r\nprovided that indicates whether scores were low, medium, high, or\r\nmaximum. Several derived variables are also provided.",

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to investigate longitudinally\r\n the developmental antecedents of physical and sexual violence against\r\n young women, using a theoretically based multicausal model that\r\n included characteristics related to the victim, the perpetrator, and\r\n the environment. The researchers used a classic longitudinal design,\r\n replicated over two cohorts (those born in 1972 and 1973), each\r\n assessed first when 18 years old, and again when 19, 20, 21, and 22\r\n years old. The first survey (Part 1, Female Data) collected\r\n information on the respondent's experiences of sexual assault from age\r\n 14 to the present (age 18). Other questions focused on the kind of\r\n person the respondent thought she was, how much of an influence\r\n religion had on the way she chose to spend each day, her dating\r\n behavior during high school, the number of times the respondent had\r\n used behavior such as discussing issues relatively calmly, arguing,\r\n sulking, stomping out of the room, or threatening to hit, with a\r\n romantic partner during high school, and how frequently romantic\r\n partners used these types of behavior with the respondent. Other items\r\n elicited information on the number of women the respondent knew who\r\n had been sexually victimized, whether men forced them to engage in\r\n sexual activities, the nature of the respondent's sexual experience\r\n from the time she was 14 to the present, the respondent's age when\r\n each experience occurred, if the respondent or the other person was\r\n using drugs or alcohol when it happened, if the respondent was\r\n injured, and whom the respondent told about the\r\n experience. Information was collected on sexual abuse prior to the age\r\n of 14 as well. The respondent was also asked to describe how often her\r\n parents or stepparents had administered physical blows (i.e., hitting,\r\n kicking, throwing someone down), whether someone had fondled her in a\r\n sexual way, whether a male had attempted intercourse with the\r\n respondent, the relationship between the respondent and the\r\n perpetrator, the respondent's age when the experience occurred, who\r\n the other person was, who initiated the date or paid for the food,\r\n drinks, or tickets, whether the respondent or the other person was\r\n using drugs or alcohol, the respondent's opinions about men and women\r\n in America (i.e., if the respondent agreed or disagreed that\r\n chivalrous gestures toward women on the part of men should be\r\n encouraged), whether the respondent had engaged in sexual intercourse\r\n when she did not want to because a male threatened or used some degree\r\n of physical force (twisting her arm, holding her down, etc.), and the\r\n respondent's drug and alcohol use. The subsequent surveys contained\r\n measures of sexual assault during each year of college (i.e., since\r\n the previous survey). Questions asked in subsequent surveys were\r\n similar to those in the first survey, and the responses are all\r\n included in Part 1. Questions posed to males (Part 2, Male Data)\r\n included the number of women the respondent had sexual intercourse\r\n with, how often the respondent heard talk that speculated how a\r\n particular woman would be in bed, reasons the respondent engaged in\r\n sexual activity, number of times the respondent engaged in sexual\r\n intercourse when a woman didn't want to, and questions similar to\r\n those in Part 1 with the respondent as the perpetrator. Demographic\r\n information in Part 1 and Part 2 describes the female or the male\r\n respondent's education, race, religious preference, sexual\r\norientation, and marital or relationship status.",

The Pretrial\r\n Diversion Program in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, targeted offenders\r\n with limited arrest histories of nonviolent felony or misdemeanor\r\n violations. The majority of eligible participants were violators of\r\n simple drug possession statutes, primarily crack/cocaine or\r\n marijuana. Persons charged with drug distribution offenses were not\r\n eligible. In order to qualify for diversion, persons had to admit\r\n guilt regarding the acts for which they were arrested. The program\r\n was entirely voluntary. One of the unique aspects of this program\r\n was its aggressive use of drug testing, including urinalysis and hair\r\n analysis. This project evaluated the ability of the IMS to provide\r\n complete drug profile information to supervising agencies and\r\n assessed its usefulness to field staff engaged in drug monitoring\r\n duties. The project was based on the premise that enhanced\r\n information on offenders diverted into this program could create or\r\n improve several key aspects of program operation, such as client\r\n assessment, monitoring of compliance and progress, dispositional\r\n decision-making, client motivation, and staff morale. The study was\r\n designed to integrate the IMS into the normal operation of the New\r\n Orleans Pretrial Diversion Program with as little modification of\r\n existing treatment and supervision protocols as possible. Each client\r\n in the diversion program underwent an intensive intake assessment\r\n including an intake radioimmunoassay (RIA) hair assay and an\r\n additional RIA hair assay every 60 days. Each client was urine-tested\r\n at intake and assigned to a random test pool. The modified protocol\r\n for the project added an IMS-based scan or a hair specimen, skin\r\n wipe, and ten-second vacuum scan of clothing, hands, and axillae at\r\n intake. At each subsequent visit each client had a repeat IMS scan\r\n utilizing a skin swab and a scan of clothing or body area. Variables\r\n include self-reported cocaine use, self-reported marijuana use, IMS\r\n date, urinalysis date, hair assay results, urinalysis results, IMS\r\n detection, nicotine use, maximum amplitude, delta, cumulative\r\n amplitude, number of detections, whether the IMS showed a positive\r\nresult, and the age, sex, and race of the client.",

-            "description": "There has been little research on United States homicide\r\nrates from a long-term perspective, primarily because there has been\r\nno consistent data series on a particular place preceding the Uniform\r\nCrime Reports (UCR), which began its first full year in 1931. To fill\r\nthis research gap, this project created a data series on homicides per\r\ncapita for New York City that spans two centuries. The goal was to\r\ncreate a site-specific, individual-based data series that could be\r\nused to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such as mass\r\nimmigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and changes in\r\nlaws. Data were also gathered on various other sites, particularly in\r\nEngland, to allow for comparisons on important issues, such as the\r\npost-World War II wave of violence. The basic approach to the data\r\ncollection was to obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts\r\nand the most complete information on individual homicides. The annual\r\ncount data (Parts 1 and 3) were derived from multiple sources,\r\nincluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports\r\nand Supplementary Homicide Reports, as well as other official counts\r\nfrom the New York City Police Department and the City Inspector in the\r\nearly 19th century. The data include a combined count of murder and\r\nmanslaughter because charge bargaining often blurs this legal\r\ndistinction. The individual-level data (Part 2) were drawn from\r\ncoroners' indictments held by the New York City Municipal Archives,\r\nand from daily newspapers. Duplication was avoided by keeping a record\r\nfor each victim. The estimation technique known as \"capture-recapture\"\r\nwas used to estimate homicides not listed in either source. Part 1\r\nvariables include counts of New York City homicides, arrests, and\r\nconvictions, as well as the homicide rate, race or ethnicity and\r\ngender of victims, type of weapon used, and source of data.

To fill\r\nthis research gap, this project created a data series on homicides per\r\ncapita for New York City that spans two centuries. The goal was to\r\ncreate a site-specific, individual-based data series that could be\r\nused to examine major social shifts related to homicide, such as mass\r\nimmigration, urban growth, war, demographic changes, and changes in\r\nlaws. Data were also gathered on various other sites, particularly in\r\nEngland, to allow for comparisons on important issues, such as the\r\npost-World War II wave of violence. The basic approach to the data\r\ncollection was to obtain the best possible estimate of annual counts\r\nand the most complete information on individual homicides. The annual\r\ncount data (Parts 1 and 3) were derived from multiple sources,\r\nincluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports\r\nand Supplementary Homicide Reports, as well as other official counts\r\nfrom the New York City Police Department and the City Inspector in the\r\nearly 19th century. The data include a combined count of murder and\r\nmanslaughter because charge bargaining often blurs this legal\r\ndistinction. The individual-level data (Part 2) were drawn from\r\ncoroners' indictments held by the New York City Municipal Archives,\r\nand from daily newspapers. Duplication was avoided by keeping a record\r\nfor each victim. The estimation technique known as \"capture-recapture\"\r\nwas used to estimate homicides not listed in either source. Part 1\r\nvariables include counts of New York City homicides, arrests, and\r\nconvictions, as well as the homicide rate, race or ethnicity and\r\ngender of victims, type of weapon used, and source of data. Part 2\r\nincludes the date of the murder, the age, sex, and race of the\r\noffender and victim, and whether the case led to an arrest, trial,\r\nconviction, execution, or pardon. Part 3 contains annual homicide\r\ncounts and rates for various comparison sites including Liverpool,\r\nLondon, Kent, Canada, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Seattle, and San\r\nFrancisco.",
