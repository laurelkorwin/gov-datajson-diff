+            "description": "Beginning in 1996, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)\r\ninitiated a major redesign of its multisite drug-monitoring program,\r\nthe Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) system (DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24\r\nCITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]). The program was\r\nretitled Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) (see ARRESTEE DRUG\r\nABUSE MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1998 [ICPSR\r\n2628] and 1999 [ICPSR 2994]). ADAM extended DUF in the number of sites\r\nand improved the quality and generalizability of the data. The\r\nredesign was fully implemented in all sites beginning in the first\r\nquarter of 2000. The ADAM program implemented a new and expanded adult\r\ninstrument in the first quarter of 2000, which was used for both the\r\nmale (Part 1) and female (Part 2) data. The juvenile data for 2000\r\n(Part 3) used the juvenile instrument from previous years. The ADAM\r\nprogram also moved to probability-based sampling for the adult male\r\npopulation during 2000. Therefore, the 2000 adult male sample includes\r\nweights, generated through post-sampling stratification of the\r\ndata. The shift to sampling of the adult male population in 2000\r\nrequired that all 35 sites move to a common catchment area, the\r\ncounty. The core instrument for the adult cases was supplemented by a\r\nfacesheet, which was used to collect demographic and charge\r\ninformation from official records. Core instruments were used to\r\ncollect self-report information from the respondent. Both the adult\r\nand juvenile instruments were administered to persons arrested and\r\nbooked on local or state charges relevant to the jurisdiction (i.e.,\r\nnot federal or out-of-county charges) within the past 48 hours. At the\r\ncompletion of the interview the arrestee was asked to voluntarily\r\nprovide a urine specimen. An external lab used the Enzyme Multiplied\r\nImmunoassay Testing (EMIT) protocols to test for the presence of ten\r\ndrugs or metabolites of the drug in the urine sample. All amphetamine\r\npositives were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\r\n(GC/MS) to determine whether methamphetamine was used. For the adult\r\ndata, variables from the facesheet include arrest precinct, ZIP code\r\nof arrest location, ZIP code of respondent's address, respondent's\r\ngender and race, three most serious arrest charges, sample source\r\n(stock, flow, other), interview status (including reason the\r\nindividual selected in the sample was not interviewed), language of\r\ninstrument used, and the number of hours since arrest. Demographic\r\ninformation from the core instrument includes respondent's age,\r\nethnicity, residency, education, employment, health insurance\r\ncoverage, marital status, housing, and telephone access. Variables\r\nfrom the calendar provide information on inpatient and outpatient\r\nsubstance abuse treatment, inpatient mental health treatment, arrests\r\nand incarcerations, heavy alcohol use, use of marijuana, crack/rock\r\ncocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other drug (ever\r\nand previous 12 months), age of first use of the above six drugs and\r\nheavy alcohol use, drug dependency in the previous 12 months,\r\ncharacteristics of drug transactions in past 30 days, use of\r\nmarijuana, crack/rock cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, and\r\nmethamphetamine in past 30 days, 7 days, and 48 hours, heavy alcohol\r\nuse in past 30 days, and secondary drug use of 15 other drugs in the\r\npast 48 hours. Urine test results are provided for 11 drugs --\r\nmarijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), benzodiazepines\r\n(Valium), propoxyphene (Darvon), methadone, methaqualone,\r\nbarbiturates, amphetamines, and methamphetamine. The adult data files\r\ninclude several derived variables. The male data also include four\r\nsampling weights, and stratum identifications and percents. For the\r\njuvenile data, demographic variables include age, race, sex,\r\neducational attainment, employment status, and living\r\ncircumstances. Data also include each juvenile arrestee's\r\nself-reported use of 15 drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, powder\r\ncocaine, crack, heroin, PCP, amphetamines, barbiturates, quaaludes,\r\nmethadone, crystal methamphetamine, Valium, LSD, and inhalants). For\r\neach drug type, arrestees reported whether they had ever used the\r\ndrug, age of first use, whether they had used the drug in the past 30\r\ndays and past 72 hours, number of days they used the drug in past\r\nmonth, whether they tried to cut down or quit using the drug, if they\r\nwere successful, whether they felt dependent on the drug, whether they\r\nwere receiving treatment for the drug, whether they had received\r\ntreatment for the drug in the past, and whether they thought they\r\ncould use treatment for that drug. Additional variables include\r\nwhether juvenile respondents had ever injected drugs, whether they\r\nwere influenced by drugs when they allegedly committed the crime for\r\nwhich they were arrested, whether they had been to an emergency room\r\nfor drug-related incidents, and if so, whether in the past 12 months,\r\nand information on arrests and charges in the past 12 months. As with\r\nthe adult data, urine test results are also provided. Finally,\r\nvariables covering precinct (precinct of arrest) and law (penal law\r\ncode associated with the crime for which the juvenile was arrested)\r\nare also provided for use by local law enforcement officials at each\r\nsite.",

The study assessed\r\n familial and nonfamilial types of violence. It was designed as a\r\n telephone survey of American youth aged 12-17 living in United States\r\n households and residing with a parent or guardian. One parent or\r\n guardian in each household was interviewed briefly to establish\r\n rapport, secure permission to interview the targeted adolescent, and\r\n to ensure the collection of comparative data to examine potential\r\n nonresponse bias from households without adolescent participation.\r\n All interviews with both parents and adolescents were conducted using\r\n Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. From the\r\n surveys of parents and adolescents, the principal investigators\r\n created one data file by attaching the data from the parents to the\r\n records of their respective adolescents. Adolescents were asked\r\n whether violence and drug abuse were problems in their schools and\r\n communities and what types of violence they had personally\r\n witnessed. They were also asked about other stressful events in their\r\n lives, such as the loss of a family member, divorce, unemployment,\r\n moving to a new home or school, serious illness or injury, and natural\r\n disaster. Questions regarding history of sexual assault, physical\r\n assault, and harsh physical discipline elicited a description of the\r\n event and perpetrator, extent of injuries, age at abuse, whether\r\n alcohol or drugs were involved, and who was informed of the\r\n incident. Information was also gathered on the delinquent behavior of\r\n respondents and their friends, including destruction of property,\r\n assault, theft, sexual assault, and gang activity. Other questions\r\n covered history of personal and family substance use and mental health\r\n indicators, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorders,\r\n weight changes, sleeping disorders, and problems\r\n concentrating. Demographic information was gathered from the\r\n adolescents on age, race, gender, number of people living in\r\n household, and grade in school. Parents were asked whether they were\r\n concerned about violent crime, affordable child care, drug abuse,\r\n educational quality, gangs, and the safety of their children at\r\n school. In addition, they were questioned about their own\r\n victimization experiences and whether they discussed personal safety\r\n issues with their children. Parents also supplied demographic\r\n information on gender, marital status, number of children, employment\r\nstatus, education, race, and income.",

-            "description": "This study was undertaken to measure the impact of the\r\n standard, treatment, and sanction dockets, which comprise the Superior\r\n Court Drug Intervention Program (SCDIP), on drug-involved defendants\r\n in Washington, DC, while examining defendants' continued drug use and\r\n substance abuse, criminal activity, and social and economic\r\n functioning. Features common to all three dockets of the SCDIP program\r\n included early intervention, frequent drug testing, and judicial\r\n involvement in monitoring drug test results, as well as the monitoring\r\n of each defendant's progress. Data for this study were collected from\r\n four sources for defendants arrested on drug felony charges between\r\n September 1, 1994, and January 31, 1996, who had been randomly\r\n assigned to one of three drug dockets (sanction, treatment, or\r\n standard) as part of the SCDIP program. First, data were collected\r\n from the Pretrial Services Agency, which provided monthly updated drug\r\n testing records, case records, and various other administrative\r\n records for all defendants assigned to any of the three\r\n dockets. Second, data regarding prior convictions and sentencing\r\n information were collected from computer files maintained by the\r\n Washington, DC, Superior Court. Third, arrest data were taken from the\r\n Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Lastly, data on self-reported drug\r\n use, criminal and personal activities, and opinions about the program\r\n were collected from interviews conducted with defendants one year\r\n after their sentencing. Variables collected from administrative\r\n records included drug test results, eligibility date for the\r\n defendant, date the defendant started treatment, number of compliance\r\n hearings, prior conviction, arrest, and sentencing information, and\r\n program entry date. Survey questions asked of each respondent fell\r\n into one of seven categories: (1) Individual characteristics, such as\r\n gender, age, and marital status. (2) Current offenses, including\r\n whether the respondent was sentenced to probation, prison, jail, or\r\n another correctional facility for any offense and the length of\r\n sentencing, special conditions or restrictions of that sentence (e.g.,\r\n electronic monitoring, mandatory drug testing, educational programs,\r\n or psychological counseling), whether any of the sentence was reduced\r\n by credit, and whether the respondent was released on bail bond or to\r\n the custody of another person. (3) Current supervision, specifically,\r\n whether the respondent was currently on probation, the number and type\r\n of contacts made with probation officers, issues discussed during the\r\n meeting, any new offenses or convictions since being on probation,\r\n outcome of any hearings, and reasons for returning back to prison,\r\n jail, or another correctional facility. (4) Criminal history, such as\r\n the number of previous arrests, age at first arrest, sentencing type,\r\n whether the respondent was a juvenile, a youthful offender, or an\r\n adult when the crime was committed, and whether any time was served\r\n for each of the following crimes: drug trafficking, drug possession,\r\n driving while intoxicated, weapons violations, robbery, sexual\r\n assault/rape, murder, other violent offenses, burglary, larceny/auto\r\n theft, fraud, property offenses, public order offenses, and\r\n probation/parole violations. (5) Socioeconomic characteristics, such\r\n as whether the respondent had a job or business, worked part- or\r\n full-time, type of job or business, yearly income, whether the\r\n respondent was looking for work, the reasons why the respondent was\r\n not looking for work, whether the respondent was living in a house,\r\n apartment, trailer, hotel, shelter, or other type of housing, whether\r\n the respondent contributed money toward rent or mortgage, number of\r\n times moved, if anyone was living with the respondent, the number and\r\n ages of any children (including step or adopted), whether child\r\n support was being paid by the respondent, who the respondent lived\r\n with when growing up, the number of siblings the respondent had,\r\n whether any of the respondent's parents spent any time in jail or\r\n prison, and whether the respondent was ever physically or sexually\r\n abused. (6) Alcohol and drug use and treatment, specifically, the type\r\n of drug used (marijuana, crack cocaine, other cocaine, heroin, PCP,\r\n and LSD), whether alcohol was consumed, the amount of each that was\r\n typically used/consumed, and whether any rehabilitation programs were\r\n attended. (7) Other services, programs, and probation conditions, such\r\n as whether any services were received for emotional or mental health\r\n problems, if any medications were prescribed, and whether the\r\n respondent was required to participate in a mental health services\r\n program, vocational training program, educational program, or\r\ncommunity service program.",

Features common to all three dockets of the SCDIP program\r\n included early intervention, frequent drug testing, and judicial\r\n involvement in monitoring drug test results, as well as the monitoring\r\n of each defendant's progress. Data for this study were collected from\r\n four sources for defendants arrested on drug felony charges between\r\n September 1, 1994, and January 31, 1996, who had been randomly\r\n assigned to one of three drug dockets (sanction, treatment, or\r\n standard) as part of the SCDIP program. First, data were collected\r\n from the Pretrial Services Agency, which provided monthly updated drug\r\n testing records, case records, and various other administrative\r\n records for all defendants assigned to any of the three\r\n dockets. Second, data regarding prior convictions and sentencing\r\n information were collected from computer files maintained by the\r\n Washington, DC, Superior Court. Third, arrest data were taken from the\r\n Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Lastly, data on self-reported drug\r\n use, criminal and personal activities, and opinions about the program\r\n were collected from interviews conducted with defendants one year\r\n after their sentencing. Variables collected from administrative\r\n records included drug test results, eligibility date for the\r\n defendant, date the defendant started treatment, number of compliance\r\n hearings, prior conviction, arrest, and sentencing information, and\r\n program entry date. Survey questions asked of each respondent fell\r\n into one of seven categories: (1) Individual characteristics, such as\r\n gender, age, and marital status. (2) Current offenses, including\r\n whether the respondent was sentenced to probation, prison, jail, or\r\n another correctional facility for any offense and the length of\r\n sentencing, special conditions or restrictions of that sentence (e.g.,\r\n electronic monitoring, mandatory drug testing, educational programs,\r\n or psychological counseling), whether any of the sentence was reduced\r\n by credit, and whether the respondent was released on bail bond or to\r\n the custody of another person. (3) Current supervision, specifically,\r\n whether the respondent was currently on probation, the number and type\r\n of contacts made with probation officers, issues discussed during the\r\n meeting, any new offenses or convictions since being on probation,\r\n outcome of any hearings, and reasons for returning back to prison,\r\n jail, or another correctional facility. (4) Criminal history, such as\r\n the number of previous arrests, age at first arrest, sentencing type,\r\n whether the respondent was a juvenile, a youthful offender, or an\r\n adult when the crime was committed, and whether any time was served\r\n for each of the following crimes: drug trafficking, drug possession,\r\n driving while intoxicated, weapons violations, robbery, sexual\r\n assault/rape, murder, other violent offenses, burglary, larceny/auto\r\n theft, fraud, property offenses, public order offenses, and\r\n probation/parole violations. (5) Socioeconomic characteristics, such\r\n as whether the respondent had a job or business, worked part- or\r\n full-time, type of job or business, yearly income, whether the\r\n respondent was looking for work, the reasons why the respondent was\r\n not looking for work, whether the respondent was living in a house,\r\n apartment, trailer, hotel, shelter, or other type of housing, whether\r\n the respondent contributed money toward rent or mortgage, number of\r\n times moved, if anyone was living with the respondent, the number and\r\n ages of any children (including step or adopted), whether child\r\n support was being paid by the respondent, who the respondent lived\r\n with when growing up, the number of siblings the respondent had,\r\n whether any of the respondent's parents spent any time in jail or\r\n prison, and whether the respondent was ever physically or sexually\r\n abused. (6) Alcohol and drug use and treatment, specifically, the type\r\n of drug used (marijuana, crack cocaine, other cocaine, heroin, PCP,\r\n and LSD), whether alcohol was consumed, the amount of each that was\r\n typically used/consumed, and whether any rehabilitation programs were\r\n attended. (7) Other services, programs, and probation conditions, such\r\n as whether any services were received for emotional or mental health\r\n problems, if any medications were prescribed, and whether the\r\n respondent was required to participate in a mental health services\r\n program, vocational training program, educational program, or\r\ncommunity service program.",

-            "description": "This study was undertaken to evaluate Alexandria,\r\nVirginia's Domestic Violence Intervention Program (DVIP), which is a\r\ncoordinated community response to domestic violence. Specifically,\r\nthe goals of the study were (1) to determine the effectiveness of\r\nDVIP, (2) to compare victims' perceptions of program satisfaction and\r\nother program elements between the Alexandria Domestic Violence\r\nIntervention Program and domestic violence victim support services in\r\nVirginia Beach, Virginia, (3) to examine the factors related to\r\nabusers who repeatedly abuse their victims, and (4) to report the\r\nfindings of attitudinal surveys of the Alexandria police department\r\nregarding the mandatory arrest policy. Data were collected from four\r\nsources. The first two sources of data were surveys conducted via\r\ntelephone interviews with females living in either Alexandria,\r\nVirginia (Part 1), or Virginia Beach, Virginia (Part 2), who were\r\nvictims of domestic violence assault incidents in which the police had\r\nbeen contacted. These surveys were designed to describe the services\r\nthat the women had received, their satisfaction with those services,\r\nand their experience with subsequent abuse. For Part 3 (Alexandria\r\nRepeat Offender Data), administrative records from the Alexandria\r\nCriminal Justice Information System (CJIS) were examined in order to\r\nidentify and examine the factors related to abusers who repeatedly\r\nabused their victims. The fourth source of data was a survey\r\ndistributed to police officers in Alexandria (Part 4, Alexandria\r\nPolice Officer Survey Data) and was developed to assess police\r\nofficers' attitudes regarding the domestic violence arrest policy in\r\nAlexandria. In four rounds of interviews for Part 1 and three rounds\r\nof interviews for Part 2, victims answered questions regarding the\r\nlocation where the domestic violence incident occurred and if the\r\npolice were involved, their perceptions of the helpfulness of the\r\npolice, prosecutor, domestic violence programs, hotlines, and\r\nshelters, their relationship to the abuser, their living arrangements\r\nat the time of each interview, and whether a protective order was\r\nobtained. Also gathered was information on the types of abuse and\r\ninjuries sustained by the victim, whether she sought medical care for\r\nthe injuries, whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the\r\nincident(s), whether the victim had been physically abused or\r\nthreatened, yelled at, had personal property destroyed, or was made to\r\nfeel unsafe by the abuser, if any other programs or persons provided\r\nhelp to the victim and how helpful these additional services were, and\r\nwhether a judge ordered services for the victim or abuser. After the\r\ninitial interviews, in subsequent rounds victims were asked if they\r\nhad had any contact with the abuser since the last interview, if they\r\nhad experienced any major life changes, if their situation had\r\nimproved or gotten worse and if so how, and what types of assistance\r\nor programs would have helped improve their situation. Demographic\r\nvariables for Part 3 include offenders' race, sex, age at first\r\ncriminal nondomestic violence charge, and age at first domestic\r\nviolence charge. Other variables include charge number, type,\r\ninitiator, disposition, and sentence of nondomestic violence charges,\r\nas well as the conditions of the sentences, imposed days, months, and\r\nyears, effective days, months, and years, type of domestic violence\r\ncase, victim's relationship to offender, victim's age, sex, and race,\r\nwhether alcohol or drugs were involved, if children were present at\r\nthe domestic violence incident, the assault method used by the\r\noffender, and the severity of the assault. For Part 4, police officers\r\nwere asked whether they knew what a domestic violent incident was,\r\nwhether arresting without a warrant was considered good policy,\r\nwhether they were in favor of domestic violence policy as a police\r\nresponse, whether they thought domestic violence policy was an\r\neffective deterrent, whether officers should have discretion to\r\narrest, and how much discretion was used to handle domestic violence\r\ncalls. The number and percent of domestic violence arrests made in the\r\nprevious year, percent of domestic violence calls that involved mutual\r\ncombat, and the number of years each respondent worked with the\r\nAlexandria, Virginia, police department are included in the file.\r\nDemographic variables for Part 4 include the age and gender of each\r\nrespondent.",

The first two sources of data were surveys conducted via\r\ntelephone interviews with females living in either Alexandria,\r\nVirginia (Part 1), or Virginia Beach, Virginia (Part 2), who were\r\nvictims of domestic violence assault incidents in which the police had\r\nbeen contacted. These surveys were designed to describe the services\r\nthat the women had received, their satisfaction with those services,\r\nand their experience with subsequent abuse. For Part 3 (Alexandria\r\nRepeat Offender Data), administrative records from the Alexandria\r\nCriminal Justice Information System (CJIS) were examined in order to\r\nidentify and examine the factors related to abusers who repeatedly\r\nabused their victims. The fourth source of data was a survey\r\ndistributed to police officers in Alexandria (Part 4, Alexandria\r\nPolice Officer Survey Data) and was developed to assess police\r\nofficers' attitudes regarding the domestic violence arrest policy in\r\nAlexandria. In four rounds of interviews for Part 1 and three rounds\r\nof interviews for Part 2, victims answered questions regarding the\r\nlocation where the domestic violence incident occurred and if the\r\npolice were involved, their perceptions of the helpfulness of the\r\npolice, prosecutor, domestic violence programs, hotlines, and\r\nshelters, their relationship to the abuser, their living arrangements\r\nat the time of each interview, and whether a protective order was\r\nobtained. Also gathered was information on the types of abuse and\r\ninjuries sustained by the victim, whether she sought medical care for\r\nthe injuries, whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the\r\nincident(s), whether the victim had been physically abused or\r\nthreatened, yelled at, had personal property destroyed, or was made to\r\nfeel unsafe by the abuser, if any other programs or persons provided\r\nhelp to the victim and how helpful these additional services were, and\r\nwhether a judge ordered services for the victim or abuser. After the\r\ninitial interviews, in subsequent rounds victims were asked if they\r\nhad had any contact with the abuser since the last interview, if they\r\nhad experienced any major life changes, if their situation had\r\nimproved or gotten worse and if so how, and what types of assistance\r\nor programs would have helped improve their situation. Demographic\r\nvariables for Part 3 include offenders' race, sex, age at first\r\ncriminal nondomestic violence charge, and age at first domestic\r\nviolence charge. Other variables include charge number, type,\r\ninitiator, disposition, and sentence of nondomestic violence charges,\r\nas well as the conditions of the sentences, imposed days, months, and\r\nyears, effective days, months, and years, type of domestic violence\r\ncase, victim's relationship to offender, victim's age, sex, and race,\r\nwhether alcohol or drugs were involved, if children were present at\r\nthe domestic violence incident, the assault method used by the\r\noffender, and the severity of the assault. For Part 4, police officers\r\nwere asked whether they knew what a domestic violent incident was,\r\nwhether arresting without a warrant was considered good policy,\r\nwhether they were in favor of domestic violence policy as a police\r\nresponse, whether they thought domestic violence policy was an\r\neffective deterrent, whether officers should have discretion to\r\narrest, and how much discretion was used to handle domestic violence\r\ncalls. The number and percent of domestic violence arrests made in the\r\nprevious year, percent of domestic violence calls that involved mutual\r\ncombat, and the number of years each respondent worked with the\r\nAlexandria, Virginia, police department are included in the file.\r\nDemographic variables for Part 4 include the age and gender of each\r\nrespondent.",

-            "description": "In 1986, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) funded a\r\ndemonstration project of intensive supervision programs (ISPs),\r\nalternatives to control sanctions that involve community sanctions and\r\nemphasize stringent conditions and close monitoring of convicted\r\noffenders. The primary intent of the demonstration project was to\r\ndetermine the effects of participation in an ISP program on the\r\nsubsequent behavior of offenders and to test the feasibility of the\r\nISP's stated objectives: (1) to reduce recidivism by providing a\r\nseemingly cost-effective alternative to imprisonment, and (2) to\r\nprovide an intermediate punishment between incarceration and regular\r\nprobation that allows the punishment to fit the crime. Fourteen sites\r\nin nine states participated in the project and each of the selected\r\nsites was funded for 18 to 24 months. Individual agencies in each site\r\ntailored their ISP programs to their local needs, resources, and\r\ncontexts, developed their own eligibility criteria, and determined\r\nwhether probationers met those criteria. While the individual ISP\r\nprojects differed, each site was required to follow identical\r\nprocedures regarding random assignment, data collection, and overall\r\nprogram evaluation. Data collection instruments that differed in the\r\namount of drug-related questions asked were used for the six- and\r\ntwelve-month reviews. The \"non-drug\" data collection instrument,\r\nused in Contra Costa, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties, CA, Marion\r\nCounty, OR, and Milwaukee, WI, gathered drug data only on the number\r\nof monthly drug and alcohol tests given to offenders. The \"drug\"\r\ndata collection instrument was distributed in Atlanta, Macon, and\r\nWaycross, GA, Seattle, WA, Santa Fe, NM, Des Moines, IA, and\r\nWinchester, VA. Variables regarding drug use included the number of\r\ndrug tests ordered, the number of drug tests taken, and the number of\r\npositives for alcohol, cocaine, heroin, uppers, downers, quaaludes,\r\nLSD/hallucinogens, PCP, marijuana/hashish, and \"other\". The drug\r\nquestions on the instrument used in Dallas and Houston, TX, were the\r\nsame as those asked at the drug sites. Once a site determined that an\r\noffender was eligible for inclusion, RAND staff randomly assigned the\r\noffender to either the experimental ISP program (prison diversion,\r\nenhanced probation, or enhanced parole) or to a control sanction\r\n(prison, routine probation, or parole). Assignment periods began in\r\nJanuary 1987 and some sites continued to accept cases through January\r\n1990. Each offender was followed for a period of one year, beginning\r\non the day of assignment to the experimental or control program. The\r\nsix-month and twelve-month review data contain identical variables:\r\nthe current status of the offender (prison, ISP, or terminated),\r\nrecord of each arrest and/or technical violation, its disposition, and\r\nsentence or sanction. Information was also recorded for each month\r\nduring the follow-up regarding face-to-face contacts, phone and\r\ncollateral contacts, monitoring and record checks, community service\r\nhours, days on electronic surveillance (if applicable), contacts\r\nbetween client and community sponsor, number and type of counseling\r\nsessions and training, days in paid employment and earnings, number of\r\ndrug and alcohol tests taken, and amount of restitution, fines, court\r\ncosts, and probation fees paid. Background variables include sex,\r\nrace, age at assignment, prior criminal history, drug use and\r\ntreatment history, type of current offense, sentence characteristics,\r\nconditions imposed, and various items relating to risk of recidivism\r\nand need for treatment. For the two Texas sites, information on each\r\narrest and/or technical violation, its disposition, and sentence or\r\nsanction was recorded in separate recidivism files (Parts 10 and\r\n17). Dates were converted by RAND to time-lapse variables for the\r\npublic release files that comprise this data collection.",

Variables regarding drug use included the number of\r\ndrug tests ordered, the number of drug tests taken, and the number of\r\npositives for alcohol, cocaine, heroin, uppers, downers, quaaludes,\r\nLSD/hallucinogens, PCP, marijuana/hashish, and \"other\". The drug\r\nquestions on the instrument used in Dallas and Houston, TX, were the\r\nsame as those asked at the drug sites. Once a site determined that an\r\noffender was eligible for inclusion, RAND staff randomly assigned the\r\noffender to either the experimental ISP program (prison diversion,\r\nenhanced probation, or enhanced parole) or to a control sanction\r\n(prison, routine probation, or parole). Assignment periods began in\r\nJanuary 1987 and some sites continued to accept cases through January\r\n1990. Each offender was followed for a period of one year, beginning\r\non the day of assignment to the experimental or control program. The\r\nsix-month and twelve-month review data contain identical variables:\r\nthe current status of the offender (prison, ISP, or terminated),\r\nrecord of each arrest and/or technical violation, its disposition, and\r\nsentence or sanction. Information was also recorded for each month\r\nduring the follow-up regarding face-to-face contacts, phone and\r\ncollateral contacts, monitoring and record checks, community service\r\nhours, days on electronic surveillance (if applicable), contacts\r\nbetween client and community sponsor, number and type of counseling\r\nsessions and training, days in paid employment and earnings, number of\r\ndrug and alcohol tests taken, and amount of restitution, fines, court\r\ncosts, and probation fees paid. Background variables include sex,\r\nrace, age at assignment, prior criminal history, drug use and\r\ntreatment history, type of current offense, sentence characteristics,\r\nconditions imposed, and various items relating to risk of recidivism\r\nand need for treatment. For the two Texas sites, information on each\r\narrest and/or technical violation, its disposition, and sentence or\r\nsanction was recorded in separate recidivism files (Parts 10 and\r\n17). Dates were converted by RAND to time-lapse variables for the\r\npublic release files that comprise this data collection.",

-            "description": "In the late 1970s, the Rand Corporation pioneered a method\r\nof collecting crime rate statistics. They obtained reports of\r\noffending behavior--types and frequencies of crimes\r\ncommitted--directly from offenders serving prison sentences. The\r\ncurrent study extends this research by exploring the extent to which\r\nvariation in the methodological approach affects prisoners'\r\nself-reports of criminal activity. If the crime rates reported in this\r\nsurvey remained constant across methods, perhaps one of the new\r\ntechniques developed would be easier and/or less expensive to\r\nadminister. Also, the self-reported offending rate data for female\r\noffenders in this collection represents the first time such data has\r\nbeen collected for females. Male and female prisoners recently\r\nadmitted to the Diagnostic Unit of the Colorado Department of\r\nCorrections were selected for participation in the study. Prisoners\r\nwere given one of two different survey instruments, referred to as the\r\nlong form and short form. Both questionnaires dealt with the number of\r\ntimes respondents committed each of eight types of crimes during a\r\n12-month measurement period. The crimes of interest were burglary,\r\nrobbery, assault, theft, auto theft, forgery/credit card and\r\ncheck-writing crimes, fraud, and drug dealing. The long form of the\r\ninstrument focused on juvenile and adult criminal activity and covered\r\nthe offender's childhood and family. It also contained questions about\r\nthe offender's rap sheet as one of the bases for validating the\r\nself-reported data. The crime count sections of the long form\r\ncontained questions about motivation, initiative, whether the offender\r\nusually acted alone or with others, and if the crimes recorded\r\nincluded crimes against people he or she knew. Long-form data are\r\ngiven in Part 1. The short form of the survey had fewer or no\r\nquestions compared with the long form on areas such as the\r\nrespondent's rap sheet, the number of crimes committed as a juvenile,\r\nthe number of times the respondent was on probation or parole, the\r\nrespondent's childhood experiences, and the respondent's perception of\r\nhis criminal career. These data are contained in Part 2. In addition,\r\nthe surveys were administered under different conditions of\r\nconfidentiality. Prisoners given what were called \"confidential\"\r\ninterviews had their names identified with the survey. Those\r\ninterviewed under conditions of anonymity did not have their names\r\nassociated with the survey. The short forms were all administered\r\nanonymously, while the long forms were either anonymous or\r\nconfidential. In addition to the surveys, data were collected from\r\nofficial records, which are presented in Part 3. The official record\r\ndata collection form was designed to collect detailed criminal history\r\ninformation, particularly during the measurement period identified in\r\nthe questionnaires, plus a number of demographic and drug-use items.\r\nThis information, when compared with the self-reported offense data\r\nfrom the measurement period in both the short and long forms, allows a\r\nvalidity analysis to be performed.",

They obtained reports of\r\noffending behavior--types and frequencies of crimes\r\ncommitted--directly from offenders serving prison sentences. The\r\ncurrent study extends this research by exploring the extent to which\r\nvariation in the methodological approach affects prisoners'\r\nself-reports of criminal activity. If the crime rates reported in this\r\nsurvey remained constant across methods, perhaps one of the new\r\ntechniques developed would be easier and/or less expensive to\r\nadminister. Also, the self-reported offending rate data for female\r\noffenders in this collection represents the first time such data has\r\nbeen collected for females. Male and female prisoners recently\r\nadmitted to the Diagnostic Unit of the Colorado Department of\r\nCorrections were selected for participation in the study. Prisoners\r\nwere given one of two different survey instruments, referred to as the\r\nlong form and short form. Both questionnaires dealt with the number of\r\ntimes respondents committed each of eight types of crimes during a\r\n12-month measurement period. The crimes of interest were burglary,\r\nrobbery, assault, theft, auto theft, forgery/credit card and\r\ncheck-writing crimes, fraud, and drug dealing. The long form of the\r\ninstrument focused on juvenile and adult criminal activity and covered\r\nthe offender's childhood and family. It also contained questions about\r\nthe offender's rap sheet as one of the bases for validating the\r\nself-reported data. The crime count sections of the long form\r\ncontained questions about motivation, initiative, whether the offender\r\nusually acted alone or with others, and if the crimes recorded\r\nincluded crimes against people he or she knew. Long-form data are\r\ngiven in Part 1. The short form of the survey had fewer or no\r\nquestions compared with the long form on areas such as the\r\nrespondent's rap sheet, the number of crimes committed as a juvenile,\r\nthe number of times the respondent was on probation or parole, the\r\nrespondent's childhood experiences, and the respondent's perception of\r\nhis criminal career. These data are contained in Part 2. In addition,\r\nthe surveys were administered under different conditions of\r\nconfidentiality. Prisoners given what were called \"confidential\"\r\ninterviews had their names identified with the survey. Those\r\ninterviewed under conditions of anonymity did not have their names\r\nassociated with the survey. The short forms were all administered\r\nanonymously, while the long forms were either anonymous or\r\nconfidential. In addition to the surveys, data were collected from\r\nofficial records, which are presented in Part 3. The official record\r\ndata collection form was designed to collect detailed criminal history\r\ninformation, particularly during the measurement period identified in\r\nthe questionnaires, plus a number of demographic and drug-use items.\r\nThis information, when compared with the self-reported offense data\r\nfrom the measurement period in both the short and long forms, allows a\r\nvalidity analysis to be performed.",

One such\r\n measure was the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised\r\n (WISC-R), a general test of intelligence, which David Wechsler, the\r\n test's author, defined as \"the global capacity of the individual to\r\n act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with\r\n his environment.\" In keeping with this definition of intelligence as\r\n an aggregate of mental aptitudes or abilities, the WISC-R has\r\n traditionally consisted of 13 subtests divided into two parts, verbal\r\n and performance. For this study, the WISC-R included definitions of\r\nwords only. It was administered to Cohorts 3, 6, 9, and 12.",

-            "description": "The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods\r\n (PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,\r\n schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.\r\n One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which\r\n was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over\r\n 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and\r\n their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing\r\n circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,\r\n that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial\r\n behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One of\r\n the measures that composed the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the Youth\r\n Self Report (YSR). The YSR protocol, a self-administered survey, was\r\n first developed by Thomas M. Achenbach and was derived from another\r\n widely-used standardized measure in child psychology, the Child\r\n Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The YSR was designed to assess the\r\n emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents (aged 11 to 18) in a\r\n standardized format. The PHDCN version of the YSR was administered to\r\n subjects belonging to Cohorts 6, 9, and 12 of the Longitudinal Cohort\r\n Study. It assessed internalizing (i.e., anxiety, depression, and\r\n overcontrolled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactivity,\r\n noncompliant, and undercontrolled) behaviors. Six sub-scale symptoms\r\n (Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxiety and Depression, Attention\r\n Problems, Aggressive Behavior, and Delinquent Behaviors) were also\r\n measured. The Wave 3 version of the YSR contains a reduced set of\r\n items compared to the Wave 1 version of the YSR PROJECT ON HUMAN\r\n DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): YOUTH SELF REPORT, WAVE\r\n 1, 1994-1997 (ICPSR 13607). The Wave 3 version is closely related to\r\n PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): YOUTH\r\nSELF REPORT, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13667).",

Surveys were administered to 93 defense attorneys and 46 prosecutors from matched counties in California. On the questionnaire, each participant was asked four background questions and read four versions of a crime scenario in which two specific eyewitness factors -- (a) same- versus cross-race identification and (b) prior contact or not -- were experimentally manipulated in a factorial design. The scenarios described a store robbery in which identification by one eyewitness was the only evidence against the defendant. After reading each scenario, attorneys were asked to respond to five questions in light of the facts presented. The study contains 28 variables including background data on the study participants and responses to questions relating to four crime scenarios that differ in terms of the details of the eyewitness evidence.",

A total of 35 (25 from one prison and 10 from the other) inmates and 15 family members were interviewed, comprising 13 inmate and family dyads, 1 inmate and family triad, and an additional 21 inmate interviews. The data include variables that explore the family's relationship with the incarcerated individual in the following areas: the inmate's relationship with the family prior to the incarceration, the strain (emotional, economic, stigma) that the incarceration has placed on the family, the economic resources available to the family to maintain the inmate, the family's social support system, and the inmate's efforts to improve or rehabilitate himself while incarcerated.",

The Community Survey (Part 1, Community Survey Quantitative Data) was used to obtain tribal members' perceptions related to the welfare of the community and their perceived levels of satisfaction with how their challenges and problems were being addressed. Data were collected between August 2006 and April 2007 using a convenience sample (n=100). Focus groups (Part 2, Focus Group Interview Qualitative Data) were held with key stake holders from five groups: past adult clients (n=6), parents of juvenile probationers (n=4), service providers and key project staff (n=4), elders (n=5), and policy-makers (n=2). The focus groups were held during three site visits between October 2006 and April 2007. Part 1 (Community Survey Quantitative Data) includes demographic variables such as gender, age, tribal enrollment status, number of years in the community, and experiences with criminal justice systems (both on and off the reservation). Other questions asked the respondent about major problems within the community (i.e., alcohol and drug use, violent crime, child and elder abuse or neglect, gang activity, and property crime) and what was being done to address the problem. Part 2 (Focus Group Interview Qualitative Data) variables were developed based on the type of focus group. Questions for past drug court participants and parents of the juvenile probationers focused on their experiences with the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (IASAP). Questions for policy-makers, service providers, and program staff focused  on the impact and sustainability of the IASAP. Questions for elders focused on issues related to culture, traditional practices, and the barriers to providing cultural and/or traditional services.",

-            "description": "The study was designed to help increase the capacity of programs to prevent gender violence and harassment (GV/H) among middle school youth. The long-term goal of the study was to help prevent intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and sexual harassment by employing rigorous methods to evaluate strategies for altering violence-supportive attitudes and norms of youth. Specifically, the study was structured to evaluate the relative effectiveness of common approaches to youth GV/H prevention programming (in terms of knowledge, attitudes, intended behavior, behavior, and emotional safety of youth participants) for one of the youngest populations ever studied in this area.  In a longitudinal randomized controlled trial study, two five-lesson curricula were created to address gender violence and harassment (GV/H) in middle schools, and classrooms were assigned randomly to treatment and control groups. Treatment 1 was an interaction-based curriculum focused on the setting and communication of boundaries in relationships, the determination of wanted and unwanted behaviors, and the role of the bystander as intervener. Treatment 2 was a law and justice curriculum focused on laws, definitions, information, and data about penalties for sexual assault and sexual harassment. The control group did not receive either treatment. Pencil-and-paper surveys were designed for students to complete, and were administered either by a member of the research team or by teachers who were trained by a member of the research team in proper administration processes. Data were collected from three inner-ring suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, from November 2006 to May 2007.  Surveys were distributed at three different times: immediately before the assignment to one of the three study conditions, immediately after the treatment (or control condition) was completed, and 5-6 months after their assignment to one of the three study conditions. The data  contain responses for 1,507 students over 3 waves. Additionally, researchers used multiple imputations for this dataset which resulted in 5 imputed datasets for each record for a total of 7,535 cases in the data file.  The data have 697 variables, including from such questions as whether someone had ever or in the past 6 months done something to the respondent such as slapped or scratched the respondent, hit the respondent, or threatened the respondent. Additionally, respondents were asked if they had done these same actions to someone else. Respondents were also asked a series of questions regarding whether they had ever been sexually harassed by someone or if they had sexually harassed someone themselves. Next, respondents were asked to rate whether they agreed with a series of statements such as \"It is all right for a girl to ask a boy out on a date\", \"If you ignore sexual harassment, more than likely it will stop\", and \"Making sexual comments to a girl is wrong\". Students were then asked to indicate whether a series of statements were true or false, such as \"If two kids who are both under the age of 16 have sex, it is not against the law\" and \"If a person is not physically harming someone, then they are not really abusive\". Respondents were then asked to read three scenarios and indicate how they would respond in that scenario. Also, students indicated how likely they would be to react in specified ways to a prepared statement. Data also provide demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnic/racial background, as well as variables to generically identify school district, school, and class period.",

-            "description": "This study examined the often overlooked and under reported issue of elder abuse. The research focused on female victims of domestic abuse over 50 years of age. The data were also compared to similar data on women under the age of 50. The data were collected in Rhode Island for several reasons, including the state's relatively broad definition of domestic violence and the large number of reports. Researchers examined every domestic violence report made to state and local law enforcement across Rhode Island in 2002 involving women victims 50 years of age and older. These reports include every incident, whether or not police ultimately arrested the alleged suspect, that meets the statutory definition of \"domestic violence.\" The source of the report information was the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Reporting Form (DV/SA). Data were also collected about the past criminal activity of the suspects and any charges made after the study incident(s) occurred. The data were found in the Rhode Island Courts' central repository called CourtConnect. The purpose of the study was to better understand the characteristics of the victims and their abusers, the circumstances of the incidences of abuse, and the police response to the reports of domestic abuse. Data collected consisted of independent variables which are organized into conceptual clusters including those relating to victim characteristics, abuser characteristics, the nature of the incident, and the state's response to the incident. The victim characteristics included demographics and abuse history, if any. Abuser characteristics included demographics and criminal history. Incident characteristics described the abuse incidence in detail. Criminal justice response variables outlined how police and courts responded and reacted to the abuse. There were two dependent outcome variables in this study consisting of re-victimization and re-abuse. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate relationships, and multiple logistic regression. This study primarily focused on the response of the criminal justice system to elder abuse, the effect of age of victim, and re-abuse and re-victimization in order to gain a clearer picture into the realities of domestic abuse of elderly women.",

The data were also compared to similar data on women under the age of 50. The data were collected in Rhode Island for several reasons, including the state's relatively broad definition of domestic violence and the large number of reports. Researchers examined every domestic violence report made to state and local law enforcement across Rhode Island in 2002 involving women victims 50 years of age and older. These reports include every incident, whether or not police ultimately arrested the alleged suspect, that meets the statutory definition of \"domestic violence.\" The source of the report information was the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Reporting Form (DV/SA). Data were also collected about the past criminal activity of the suspects and any charges made after the study incident(s) occurred. The data were found in the Rhode Island Courts' central repository called CourtConnect. The purpose of the study was to better understand the characteristics of the victims and their abusers, the circumstances of the incidences of abuse, and the police response to the reports of domestic abuse. Data collected consisted of independent variables which are organized into conceptual clusters including those relating to victim characteristics, abuser characteristics, the nature of the incident, and the state's response to the incident. The victim characteristics included demographics and abuse history, if any. Abuser characteristics included demographics and criminal history. Incident characteristics described the abuse incidence in detail. Criminal justice response variables outlined how police and courts responded and reacted to the abuse. There were two dependent outcome variables in this study consisting of re-victimization and re-abuse. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate relationships, and multiple logistic regression. This study primarily focused on the response of the criminal justice system to elder abuse, the effect of age of victim, and re-abuse and re-victimization in order to gain a clearer picture into the realities of domestic abuse of elderly women.",

Researchers interviewed 223 female victims of sexual assault (Part 1 and Part 2) between January 2004 and July 2005 and conducted 21 focus groups (Part 3) with sexual assault resource service providers between 2003 and 2006. Criteria for inclusion in the interview component (Part 1 and Part 2) of the study included: African American or Caucasian female, aged 18 and over, resident of Maryland, and victim of sexual assault. There were four streams of recruitment for the interview portion of the study:  Victims receiving services at one of 18 rape crisis centers located throughout the state of Maryland; Community outreach sessions conducted by rape crisis center community educators; Through community service providers, including those working in domestic violence centers, forensic nurse examiners (SAFE programs), probation and parole offices, reproductive health centers, county health departments, community services agencies, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and local colleges; and Through three detention centers housing female inmates. For Part 3 (Focus Group Qualitative Data), rape crisis center representatives and other community service provider representatives received a letter informing them that a focus group was going to be conducted at the end of their study training session and asked them for their participation. Part 1 (Victim Quantitative Data) includes items in the following categories: Personal Demographics, Details of the Sexual Assault, Medical Care, Law Enforcement, Prosecution/Court Process, Sexual Assault Center Services, Other Counseling Services, and Recommendations for Improvement. Part 2 (Victim Qualitative Data) includes responses to selected questions from Part 1. The data are organized by question, not by respondent. Part 3 (Focus Group Qualitative Data) includes questions on the needs of African American women who have been sexually assaulted, whether their needs are different from those of  women of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, unique barriers to reporting sexual assault to police for African American women and their treatment by the criminal justice system, unique issues concerning the use of available resources by African American women, such as post-rape medical care and counseling services, and recommendations on how the state of Maryland could improve services for African American women who are the victims of sexual assault.",

Project researchers randomly collected a 20 percent sample of the 10,895 backlogged sexual assault cases (cases with untested sexual assault kits) at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Los Angeles Sherriff's Department (LASD) to be tested and to evaluate the scientific results achieved by private testing laboratories. After sorting through files and eliminating many due to time constraints, case count fluctuations throughout the course of the data collection, the inability to locate every case file, and removing cases due to the suspects' age, the researchers collected and coded sexual assault case information on 1,948 backlogged cases from 1982 to 2009. Data were also collected on 371 non-backlogged sexual assault cases with sexual assault kits that were tested between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2010. Data collection focused on the respective agencies' crime laboratory files and the DNA reports submitted by outside private testing laboratories. Data collection tools for this project focused on key descriptive, investigative, critical event times/dates, physical evidence, and analytical tests performed on the evidence. Records yielded information on DNA profiles and related Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) submission activity. Criminal justice case disposition information was also collected on a total of 742 cases including a sample of 371 backlogged cases and the 371 non-backlogged cases to examine the impact of evidence contained in sexual assault kits on criminal justice disposition outcomes. The resulting 2,319 case dataset, which is comprised of 1,948 backlogged cases and 371 non-backlogged cases, contains 377 variables relating to victim, suspect, and crime characteristics, laboratory information and testing results, CODIS information, and criminal justice dispositions.",

The case file included the crime report prepared by the patrol officer who responded to the crime and took the initial report from the complainant, all follow-up reports prepared by the detective to whom the case was assigned for investigation, and the detective's reasons for unfounding the report or for clearing the case by arrest or by exceptional means. The case files also included either verbatim accounts or summaries of statements made by the complainant, by witnesses (if any), and by the suspect (if the suspect was interviewed); a description of physical evidence recovered from the alleged crime scene, and the results of the physical exam (Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) exam) of the victim (if the victim reported the crime within 72 hours of the alleged assault). Members of the research team read through each case file and recorded data in an SPSS data file. There are 650 cases and 261 variables in the data file.  The variables in the data file include administrative police information and charges listed on the police report. There is also information related to the victim, the suspect, and the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDatasets 2-5 were obtained from the district attorney's office and contain outcome data that resulted in the arrest of a suspect.\r\nThe outcome data obtained from the agency was for the following sex crimes: rape, attempted rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object, oral copulation, sodomy, unlawful sex, and sexual battery.\r\n\r\n\r\nDataset 3 (Sexual Assault Case Attrition: 2005 to 2009, Los Angeles Police Department - Adult Arrests) is a subset of Dataset 2 (Sexual Assault Case Attrition: 2005 to 2009, Los Angeles Police Department - All Cases) in that it only contains cases that resulted in the arrest of at least one adult suspect.

The classroom based intervention was delivered through a six session curriculum that emphasized the consquences for perpetrators of domestic violence and harassment, state laws and penalties for domestic violence and harassment, the construction of gender roles, and healthy relationships. The school-wide intervention included the development and use of temporary school-based restraining orders, higher levels of faculty and security presence in areas identified by students and school personnel as unsafe \"hot spots\", and the use of posters to increase awareness and reporting of domestic violence and harassment to school personnel. Pencil and paper surveys were distributed to students at three different times: (1) immediately before the assignment to one of the four study conditions, (2) immediately after the treatment (or control condition) was completed, and (3) between five and six months after assignment to one of the four study conditions.

The program has the goal of building protection and impeding risk trajectories for aggression, violence, and school failure. The program utilizes multiple family groups (four to six families) combined with reading tutoring for the child. The SAFE Effectiveness Trial (SAFE-E) involved community providers delivering the family group intervention and upper grade students delivering the tutoring program. The trial took place between 2006 and 2010, and involved two age cohorts of children. Collaborating with two community mental health agencies and six elementary schools serving high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois, families were randomly assigned to intervention groups of four to six families during their child's first grade year. Children also received tutoring from tutors selected from the upper grades of the child's school. Assessments were collected prior to, during and after the intervention to assess developmental influences, fidelity, process, and implementation characteristics that might affect impact. The purpose of these assessments was to examine the relation of implementation qualities to variation in intervention effects. Quality of implementation was expected to affect short and long-term impact of the intervention, focusing on three primary areas: (1) fidelity of implementation of the program, (2) provider characteristics, such as tutors' reading levels, and attitudes and orientation of the family intervention providers, and (3) quality of support for implementation. The data are from fidelity and process measures developed for this study and measures completed by parents, teachers, and children over four waves of measurement spanning two years, beginning in the fall of each child's first grade year.",

These statements were then operationalized into measurable Likert-scale items that were scored by 291 use of force instructors from more than 100 agencies across the United States using an online survey instrument. The dataset resulting from this process contains a total of 685 variables, comprised of 312 difficulty statement items, 278 performance statement items, and 94 variables that measure the demographic characteristics of the scorers.",

This prison system housed more than 30,000 inmates across 15 institutions (14 men's facilities; 1 women's facility). The data contain information on inmates' placements into different housing units across all 15 state prison complexes, including designated maximum security, restrictive housing units. Inmates placed in restrictive housing were in lockdown the majority of the day, had limited work opportunities, and were closely monitored. These inmates were also escorted in full restraints within the institution. They experienced little recreational time, visitation and phone privileges, and few interactions with other inmates.\r\nThe data contain information on inmates' housing placements, institutional misconduct, risk factors, demographic characteristics, criminal history, and offense information. These data provide information on every housing placement for each inmate, including the time spent in each placement, and the reasons documented by correctional staff for placing inmates in each housing unit. Demographic information includes inmate sex, race/ethnicity, and age.\r\n\r\nThe collection contains 1 Stata data file \"Inmate-Housing-Placements-Data.dta\" with 16 variables and 124,942 cases.",

Data were collected from 774 older adults 8 years following their participation in Wave I of the NEMS. This represented the results of contacting every locatable participant who reported psychological, physical, or sexual (but not financial) abuse at Wave I (achieved subsample n = 183 of the original 753 Wave I victims) and a comparison sample of 591 randomly selected Wave I non-victims from the remaining 2,149 working phone numbers of the original 5,024 non-victims (at Wave I). As mentioned, financial abuse classification at Wave I was not used to identify the victim subgroup prior to sampling, however retrospective analysis indicated that the two aforementioned sampling groups (every working phone number of Wave I victims of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse AND every working phone number of the 2,149 comparison Wave I participants) accounted for all but 7 financial abuse victims identified as such at Wave I (i.e., no other financial abuse victims at Wave I could have possibly been re-contacted). The cooperation rate (upon contact), for Wave I victims of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse was 66%; the cooperation rate of comparison Wave I participants was 57%. (Note: it had originally been proposed to conduct propensity matching once the sample of Wave I victims was re-contacted, however by conserving funds during this first phase, the study was able to expand from propensity matching to random selection of a much larger group of over 2,149, for a final derived sample of 774.)",

A 2x2 factorial design was used to\r\nassess the effects of the two manipulations. The first two\r\nexperimental conditions involved administering either the standard DUF\r\ninformed consent or an enhanced consent that told the arrestees more\r\nabout the confidential nature of the research and the capabilities of\r\nurinalysis. The second two conditions involved collecting the urine\r\nspecimen either before or after the interview was administered. The\r\nexperiment included 2,015 adult arrestees from Cleveland, Ohio,\r\nDetroit, Michigan, and Houston, Texas, who were randomly assigned to\r\none of the four experimental conditions. The experiment was designed\r\nso that the only variability across the interviews was the\r\nmanipulation of informed consent and the sequencing of the urine\r\nspecimen request. All other procedures of a standard DUF collection\r\nwere followed. Data were collected in Cleveland between July 8 and\r\nAugust 22, 1997, in Detroit from August 4 to September 27, 1997, and\r\nin Houston from October 17 to November 1, 1997. Variables specific to\r\nthis project include the experimental condition to which the\r\nrespondent was assigned, follow-up questions asking whether the\r\narrestee would have responded differently if assigned to the other\r\nconditions, and several dummy variables on length and type of drug\r\nuse. Data from the DUF interview provided detailed information about\r\neach arrestee's self-reported use of 15 drugs. For each drug type,\r\narrestees were asked whether they had ever used the drug, the age at\r\nwhich they first used the drug, whether they had used the drug within\r\nthe past three days, how many days they had used the drug within the\r\npast month, whether they had ever needed or felt dependent on the\r\ndrug, and whether they were dependent on the drug at the time of the\r\ninterview. Data from the DUF interview instrument also included\r\nalcohol/drug treatment history, information about whether arrestees\r\nhad ever injected drugs, and whether they were influenced by drugs\r\nwhen the crime that they were charged with was committed. The data\r\nalso include information about whether the arrestee had been to an\r\nemergency room for drug-related incidents and whether he or she had\r\nhad prior arrests in the past 12 months. Urine tests screened for the\r\npresence of ten drugs, including marijuana, opiates, cocaine, PCP,\r\nmethadone, benzodiazepines (Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene\r\n(Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines (positive test results for\r\namphetamines were confirmed by gas chromatography). Demographic data\r\ninclude the age, race, sex, educational attainment, marital status,\r\nemployment status, and living circumstances of each respondent.",

-            "description": "Effective October 1, 1994, the state of North Carolina\r\n implemented a new structured sentencing law that applied to all felony\r\n and misdemeanor crimes (except for driving while impaired) committed\r\n on or after October 1, 1994. Under the new structured sentencing law\r\n parole was eliminated, and a sentencing commission developed\r\n recommended ranges of punishment for offense and offender categories,\r\n set priorities for the use of correctional resources, and developed a\r\n model to estimate correctional populations. This study sought to\r\n investigate sentencing reforms by looking at the effects of structured\r\n sentencing on multiple aspects of the adjudication process in North\r\n Carolina. A further objective was to determine whether there were\r\n differences in the commission of institutional infractions between\r\n inmates sentenced to North Carolina prisons under the pre-structured\r\n versus structured sentencing laws. Researchers hoped that the results\r\n of this study may help North Carolina and jurisdictions around the\r\n country (1) anticipate the likely effects of structured sentencing\r\n laws, (2) design new laws that might better achieve the jurisdictions'\r\n goals, and (3) improve the potential of sentencing legislation in\r\n order to enhance public safety in an effective and equitable\r\n way. Administrative records data were collected from two\r\n sources. First, in order to examine the effects of structured\r\n sentencing on the adjudication process in North Carolina, criminal\r\n case data were obtained from the North Carolina Administrative Office\r\n of the Courts (Parts 1 and 2). The pre-structured sentencing and\r\n structured sentencing samples were selected at the case level, and\r\n each record in Parts 1 and 2 represents a charged offense processed in\r\n either the North Carolina Superior or District Court. Second, inmate\r\n records data were collected from administrative records provided by\r\n the North Carolina Department of Correction (Part 3). These data were\r\n used to compare the involvement in infractions of inmates sentenced\r\n under both pre-structured and structured sentencing.

Variables for Parts 1 and 2 include type of\r\n charge, charged offense date, method of disposition (e.g., dismissal,\r\n withdrawal, jury trial), defendant's plea, verdict for the offense,\r\n and whether the offense was processed through the North Carolina\r\n Superior or District Court.

+            "description": "Effective October 1, 1994, the state of North Carolina\r\n implemented a new structured sentencing law that applied to all felony\r\n and misdemeanor crimes (except for driving while impaired) committed\r\n on or after October 1, 1994. Under the new structured sentencing law\r\n parole was eliminated, and a sentencing commission developed\r\n recommended ranges of punishment for offense and offender categories,\r\n set priorities for the use of correctional resources, and developed a\r\n model to estimate correctional populations. This study sought to\r\n investigate sentencing reforms by looking at the effects of structured\r\n sentencing on multiple aspects of the adjudication process in North\r\n Carolina. A further objective was to determine whether there were\r\n differences in the commission of institutional infractions between\r\n inmates sentenced to North Carolina prisons under the pre-structured\r\n versus structured sentencing laws. Researchers hoped that the results\r\n of this study may help North Carolina and jurisdictions around the\r\n country (1) anticipate the likely effects of structured sentencing\r\n laws, (2) design new laws that might better achieve the jurisdictions'\r\n goals, and (3) improve the potential of sentencing legislation in\r\n order to enhance public safety in an effective and equitable\r\n way. Administrative records data were collected from two\r\n sources. First, in order to examine the effects of structured\r\n sentencing on the adjudication process in North Carolina, criminal\r\n case data were obtained from the North Carolina Administrative Office\r\n of the Courts (Parts 1 and 2). The pre-structured sentencing and\r\n structured sentencing samples were selected at the case level, and\r\n each record in Parts 1 and 2 represents a charged offense processed in\r\n either the North Carolina Superior or District Court. Second, inmate\r\n records data were collected from administrative records provided by\r\n the North Carolina Department of Correction (Part 3). These data were\r\n used to compare the involvement in infractions of inmates sentenced\r\n under both pre-structured and structured sentencing. The data for Part\r\n 3 focused on inmates entering the prison system between June 1, 1995,\r\n and January 31, 1998. Variables for Parts 1 and 2 include type of\r\n charge, charged offense date, method of disposition (e.g., dismissal,\r\n withdrawal, jury trial), defendant's plea, verdict for the offense,\r\n and whether the offense was processed through the North Carolina\r\n Superior or District Court.

Demographic\r\n variables for Parts 1 and 2 include the defendant's age, race, and\r\n gender. Part 3 variables include the date of prison admission,\r\n sentence type, number of prior incarcerations, number of years served\r\n during prior incarcerations, maximum sentence length for current\r\n incarceration, jail credit in years, count of all infractions during\r\n current and prior incarcerations, reason for incarceration, infraction\r\n rate, the risk for alcohol and drug dependency based on alcohol and\r\n chemical dependency screening scores, and the number of assault,\r\n drug/alcohol, profanity/disobedience, work absence, and money/property\r\n infractions during an inmate's current incarceration.

Rather than investigating the general\r\nprevalence of guns, this study focused only on those firearms used in\r\nthe commission of crimes. Crime guns were defined specifically as\r\nthose used in murders, assaults, robberies, weapons offenses, and drug\r\noffenses. The emphasis of the project was on the attributes of crime\r\nguns and those who possess them, the geographic sources of those guns,\r\nthe distribution of crime guns over neighborhoods in a city, and the\r\nrelationship between the prevalence of crime guns and the incidence of\r\nhomicide. Data for Part 1, Traced Guns Data, came from the City of\r\nPittsburgh Bureau of Police. Gun trace data provided a detailed view\r\nof crime guns recovered by police during a two-year period, from 1995\r\nto 1997. These data identified the original source of each crime gun\r\n(first sale to a non-FFL, i.e., a person not holding a Federal\r\nFirearms License) as well as attributes of the gun and the person\r\npossessing the gun at the time of the precipitating crime, and the\r\nZIP-code location where the gun was recovered. For Part 2, Crime\r\nLaboratory Data, data were gathered from the local county crime\r\nlaboratory on guns submitted by Pittsburgh police for forensic\r\ntesting. These data were from 1993 to 1998 and provided a longer time\r\nseries for examining changes in crime guns over time than the data in\r\nPart 1. In Parts 3 and 4, Stolen Guns by ZIP-Code Data and Stolen Guns\r\nby Census Tract Data, data on stolen guns came from the local\r\npolice. These data included the attributes of the guns and residential\r\nneighborhoods of owners. Part 3 contains data from 1987 to 1996\r\norganized by ZIP code, whereas Part 4 contains data from 1993 to 1996\r\norganized by census tract. Part 5, Shots Fired Data, contains the\r\nfinal indicator of crime gun prevalence for this study, which was 911\r\ncalls of incidents involving shots fired. These data provided vital\r\ninformation on both the geographic location and timing of these\r\nincidents. Shots-fired incidents not only captured varying levels of\r\naccess to crime guns, but also variations in the willingness to\r\nactually use crime guns in a criminal manner. Part 6, Homicide Data,\r\ncontains homicide data for the city of Pittsburgh from 1990 to\r\n1995. These data were used to examine the relationship between varying\r\nlevels of crime gun prevalence and levels of homicide, especially\r\nyouth homicide, in the same city. Part 7, Pilot Mapping Application,\r\nis a pilot application illustrating the potential uses of mapping\r\ntools in police investigations of crime guns traced back to original\r\npoint of sale. NTC.

Part 2 also\r\ncontains gun type and model, as well as gun make, precipitating\r\noffense, police zone submitting the gun, and year the gun was\r\nsubmitted to the crime lab. Variables in Parts 3 and 4 include month\r\nand year the gun was stolen, gun type, make, and caliber, and owner\r\nresidence. Residence locations are limited to owner ZIP code in Part\r\n3, and 1990 Census tract number and neighborhood name in Part 4. Part\r\n5 contains the date, time, census tract and police zone of 911 calls\r\nrelating to shots fired. Part 6 contains the date and census tract of\r\nthe homicide incident, drug involvement, gang involvement, weapon, and\r\nvictim and offender ages. Data in Part 7 include state, county, and\r\nZIP code of traced guns, population figures, and counts of crime guns\r\nrecovered at various geographic locations (states, counties, and ZIP\r\ncodes) where the traced guns first originated in sales by an FFL to a\r\nnon-FFL individual.

Data were collected from 187 female stalking victims during\r\n 1991-1995 living in Chester, Delaware, Bucks, Philadelphia, and\r\n Montgomery counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. Data collection was\r\n comprised of an extensive, semistructured, face-to-face interview\r\n conducted with each woman to gather information concerning the nature\r\n of the stalking, the relationship between the victim and the stalker,\r\n the victim's response to the stalking, the consequences of the\r\n stalking for the victim, the needs of stalking victims in general, and\r\n fulfillment of those needs in terms of victim services and interaction\r\n with and cooperation from the criminal justice system.

Data were collected from 187 female stalking victims during\r\n 1991-1995 living in Chester, Delaware, Bucks, Philadelphia, and\r\n Montgomery counties in southeastern Pennsylvania. Data collection was\r\n comprised of an extensive, semistructured, face-to-face interview\r\n conducted with each woman to gather information concerning the nature\r\n of the stalking, the relationship between the victim and the stalker,\r\n the victim's response to the stalking, the consequences of the\r\n stalking for the victim, the needs of stalking victims in general, and\r\n fulfillment of those needs in terms of victim services and interaction\r\n with and cooperation from the criminal justice system.

Under the Corrections Program Office of the Office of \r\n Justice Programs of the United States Department of Justice, state and local \r\n correctional agencies received funds to develop or enhance existing programs \r\n that: (1) lasted between six and 12 months, (2) provided residential treatment \r\n facilities set apart from the general correctional population, (3) were \r\n directed at the substance abuse problems of the inmate, (4) were intended to \r\n develop the inmate's cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other \r\n skills in order to treat related problems as well as the substance abuse, and (5) \r\n continued to require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug \r\n and alcohol testing of individuals assigned to treatment programs during and \r\n after release from residential custody. The National Development and Research \r\n Institutes, Inc. (NDRI) entered into a cooperative agreement with \r\n the National Institute of Justice wherein NDRI would evaluate the extent to which the goals of the RSAT program \r\n were being accomplished and the problems that were encountered by the \r\n participating states. The methods of this national evaluation were: (1) \r\n an initial state survey to ascertain the RSAT programs and program directors \r\n in each of the 50 states plus five territories and the District of Columbia \r\n and to collect basic information on the aggregate impact of the RSAT-funded \r\n programs in each state or territory (Part 1, State Data), (2) a follow-up state survey to \r\n collect more detailed information on the aggregate impact of the RSAT-funded \r\n programs in each state (Part 1, State Data), and (3) an initial program survey to describe \r\n the separate RSAT programs as they came on line and to assess whether a few of \r\n the programs might serve as model programs which could undergo subsequent \r\n intensive evaluation (Part 2, Program Data). The sampling method used was a census of all the existing RSAT-funded \r\n programs and all of the state RSAT officials. Part 1 variables include the \r\n amount of RSAT funds received by the state in fiscal years 1996 to 1998, \r\n amounts from other sources of funding, and amount spent on salaries, training, \r\n drug tests, other supplies, and facilities, as well as number of residents, number of \r\n staff, reasons why funding was delayed, RSAT award date, and RSAT end date.\r\n Part 2 variables include the number of clients in the program, number of beds \r\n available, number of staff by gender, race, age, education, profession, and \r\n years of experience, admission inclusion criteria, reporting procedures, treatment \r\n type and duration, type of drug testing and number of tests, annual budget, \r\nsources of funding, and cost per capita.",

-            "description": "Oleoresin capsicum (OC), or pepper spray, has gained wide\r\n acceptance as standard police equipment in law enforcement as a swift\r\n and effective method to subdue violent, dangerous suspects in the\r\n field. As a use-of-force method, however, OC spray has been alleged in\r\n the media to have been associated with a number of in-custody\r\n deaths. The goal of this study was to assess the safety of a\r\n commercially available OC spray in use by law enforcement agencies\r\n nationwide. The study was conducted as a randomized, cross-over,\r\n controlled trial on volunteer human subjects recruited from the local\r\n law enforcement training academy in San Diego County,\r\n California. Subjects participated in four different experimental\r\n trials in random order over two separate days in a pulmonary function\r\n testing laboratory: (a) placebo spray exposure followed by sitting\r\n position, (b) placebo spray exposure followed by restraint position,\r\n (c) OC spray exposure followed by sitting position, and (d) OC spray\r\n exposure followed by restraint position. Prior to participation,\r\n subjects completed a short questionnaire regarding their health\r\n status, history of lung disease and asthma, smoking history,\r\n medication use, and respiratory inhaler medication use. Prior to\r\n exposure, subjects also underwent a brief screening spirometry in the\r\n sitting position by means of a portable spirometry device to determine\r\n baseline pulmonary function. Subjects then placed their heads in a 5'\r\n x 3' x 3' exposure box that allowed their faces to be exposed to the\r\n spray. A one-second spray was delivered into the box from the end\r\n opposite the subject (approximately five feet away). Subjects remained\r\n in the box for five seconds after the spray was delivered. During this\r\n time, subjects underwent impedance monitoring to assess whether\r\n inhalation of the OC or placebo spray had occurred. After this\r\n exposure period, subjects were placed in either the sitting or prone\r\n maximal restraint position. Subjects remained in these positions for\r\n ten minutes. Repeat spirometric measurements were performed, oxygen\r\n saturation, blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, and pulse\r\n rate were recorded, and an arterial blood sample was drawn. A total of\r\n 34 subjects completed the study, comprising 128 separate analyzable\r\n study trials. Variables provided in all three parts of this collection\r\n include subject's age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass\r\n index, past medical history, tobacco use history, and history of\r\n medication use, as well as OC spray or placebo exposure and sitting or\r\n restraint position during the trial. Part 1 also includes tidal\r\n volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate at baseline and at 1, 5, 7,\r\n and 9 minutes, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at baseline\r\n and at 3, 6, and 9 minutes. Additional variables in Part 2 include\r\n predicted forced vital capacity and predicted forced expiratory volume\r\n in 1 second, and the same measures at baseline, 1.5 minutes, and 10\r\n minutes. Derived variables include percent predicted and mean percent\r\n predicted values involving the above variables. Part 3 also provides\r\n end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygenation levels, oxygen saturation,\r\n oxygen consumption at baseline and at 1, 5, 7, and 9 minutes, blood\r\n pH, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide\r\nat 8 minutes.",

The study sought to answer: (1) What is the prevalence of\r\nofficer fatigue, and what are officers' attitudes toward it? (2) What\r\nare the causes or correlates of officer fatigue? (3) How does fatigue\r\naffect officer safety, health, and job performance? and (4) Can\r\nofficer fatigue be measured objectively? The final sample was\r\ncomprised of all sworn, nonsupervisory police officers assigned\r\nfull-time to patrol and/or community policing functions on the day\r\nthat data collection began at each of four selected sites: Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts, Polk County, Florida, Portland, Oregon, and Arlington\r\nCounty, Virginia. Part 1, Fatigue Survey Data, includes demographic\r\ndata and officers' responses from the initial self-report\r\nsurvey. Variables include the extent to which the respondent felt hot\r\nor cold, experienced uncomfortable breathing, bad dreams, or pain\r\nwhile sleeping, the time the respondent usually went to bed, number of\r\nhours slept each night, quality of sleep, whether medicine was taken\r\nas a sleep aid, estimated hours worked in a one-, two-, seven-, and\r\nthirty-day period, how overtime affected income, family relationships,\r\nand social activities, and reasons for feeling tired. Part 2,\r\nDemographic and Fatigue Survey Data, is comprised of data obtained\r\nfrom administrative records and demographic data forms. Several\r\nmeasures from the initial self-report survey are also included in Part\r\n2. Variables focus on respondents' age, sex, race, marital status,\r\nglobal score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, total years\r\nas a police officer assigned to any agency and current agency, and\r\ntotal years worked in current shift. Data for Part 3, FIT and\r\nAdministrative Data, were obtained from administrative records and\r\nfrom the fitness-for-duty (FIT) workplace screener test. Variables\r\ninclude a pupilometry index score and the dates, time, and particular\r\nshift (days, evenings, or midnight) the officer started working when\r\nthe pupilometry test was administered.

The study sought to answer: (1) What is the prevalence of\r\nofficer fatigue, and what are officers' attitudes toward it? (2) What\r\nare the causes or correlates of officer fatigue? (3) How does fatigue\r\naffect officer safety, health, and job performance? and (4) Can\r\nofficer fatigue be measured objectively? The final sample was\r\ncomprised of all sworn, nonsupervisory police officers assigned\r\nfull-time to patrol and/or community policing functions on the day\r\nthat data collection began at each of four selected sites: Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts, Polk County, Florida, Portland, Oregon, and Arlington\r\nCounty, Virginia. Part 1, Fatigue Survey Data, includes demographic\r\ndata and officers' responses from the initial self-report\r\nsurvey. Variables include the extent to which the respondent felt hot\r\nor cold, experienced uncomfortable breathing, bad dreams, or pain\r\nwhile sleeping, the time the respondent usually went to bed, number of\r\nhours slept each night, quality of sleep, whether medicine was taken\r\nas a sleep aid, estimated hours worked in a one-, two-, seven-, and\r\nthirty-day period, how overtime affected income, family relationships,\r\nand social activities, and reasons for feeling tired. Part 2,\r\nDemographic and Fatigue Survey Data, is comprised of data obtained\r\nfrom administrative records and demographic data forms. Several\r\nmeasures from the initial self-report survey are also included in Part\r\n2. Variables focus on respondents' age, sex, race, marital status,\r\nglobal score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale, total years\r\nas a police officer assigned to any agency and current agency, and\r\ntotal years worked in current shift. Data for Part 3, FIT and\r\nAdministrative Data, were obtained from administrative records and\r\nfrom the fitness-for-duty (FIT) workplace screener test. Variables\r\ninclude a pupilometry index score and the dates, time, and particular\r\nshift (days, evenings, or midnight) the officer started working when\r\nthe pupilometry test was administered. Part 3 also includes the number\r\nof hours worked by the officer in a regular shift or in association\r\nwith overtime, the number of sick leave hours taken by the officer,\r\nand whether the officer was involved in an on-duty accident, injured\r\non duty, or commended by his/her department during a particular\r\nshift.",

The Developmental Disabilities Institute\r\n at Wayne State University, in collaboration with the United Cerebral\r\n Palsy Association in Michigan, conducted a one-year study to\r\n investigate the prevalence and correlates of, and service system\r\n capacity related to, domestic abuse among women with physical\r\n disabilities in Michigan. The study aimed to address the following\r\n research questions: (1) What is the prevalence of domestic violence\r\n among a sample of women with physical disabilities? (2) What potential\r\n factors for domestic violence exist among women with physical\r\n disabilities? and (3) What is the capacity of existing support\r\n programs (e.g., safe houses, shelters, and service agencies) to assist\r\n women with physical disabilities? The population for this study was\r\n women over the age of 18 who had physical disabilities. Consistent\r\n with the work of other researchers, physical disabilities in this\r\n study were defined as those disabilities that result in functional\r\n impairment, such as cerebral palsy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida,\r\n amputation, rheumatic conditions, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord\r\n injury, traumatic brain injury, visual impairment, hearing impairment,\r\n and stroke. A sample of 177 women was recruited through several\r\n mechanisms. To address the question of domestic abuse prevalence, the\r\n women participating in the study were first asked to complete a brief\r\n questionnaire addressing demographic characteristics and their\r\n experience with domestic violence (Part 1, Screening Interview\r\n Data). Fifty-six percent (100) of the 177 women interviewed indicated\r\n a positive history of abuse at their initial screening. In order to\r\n address the second research question about the correlates of abuse,\r\n this subsample of 100 women was invited and encouraged to participate\r\n in the second phase of the research, which involved a more extensive\r\n interview (Part 2, Abuse Interview Data). The interview used was based\r\n on a protocol developed by Nosek (1995) that addressed demographic\r\n characteristics, social networks, and abuse history. Variables in\r\n Parts 1 and 2 include type of disability, type of personal assistance\r\n needed, and whether the respondent was ever physically, emotionally,\r\n or sexually abused. Part 2 also contains variables on sources of monthly\r\n income, who perpetrated the abuse, the abuser's gender, how long the\r\n victim knew the abuser, whether the victim sought assistance from a\r\n domestic violence program or shelter, and a description of the worst\r\n incident of physical abuse. Demographic variables in Parts 1 and 2\r\ninclude ethnicity, age, employment status, and marital status.",

-            "description": "The goal of this study was to evaluate the initial\r\nefficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of Seeking Safety (SS)\r\ntreatment in a sample of incarcerated women with comorbid substance\r\nuse disorder (SUD) and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder\r\n(PTSD). Seeking Safety, a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy\r\ntreatment, is a psychosocial treatment for women with comorbid PTSD\r\nand SUD and, at the time this study was conducted, it was the\r\ntreatment with the most efficacy data for this population. SS\r\ntreatment appears to be a promising intervention for incarcerated\r\nwomen with PTSD and SUD because (1) the treatment targets many of the\r\ndeficits found in this population that may interfere with their\r\nrecovery and place these women at risk for reoffending (such as\r\nimpulsiveness, anger dyscontrol, and maladaptive lifestyle\r\nactivities), and (2) it teaches skills to manage these problematic\r\nbehaviors. This study aimed to conduct an open feasibility trial of\r\nSeeking Safety treatment in a sample of six incarcerated women with\r\nSUD and PTSD and to conduct a randomized controlled pilot study to\r\nevaluate the initial efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of the\r\nproposed treatment as an adjunct to treatment as usual (TAU), compared\r\nto a TAU control group in a sample of 22 incarcerated women with\r\ncomorbid PTSD and SUD. The primary hypothesis was that, compared to\r\nthe TAU condition, women in the SS treatment condition would have less\r\nsevere drug and alcohol use as well as fewer PTSD symptoms and legal\r\nproblems after intervention, and at six weeks and three months after\r\nrelease. The first six participants recruited for the study received\r\nSS group treatment as an adjunct to the treatment provided by the\r\nDiscovery Program, the substance abuse treatment program in the\r\nminimum security arm of the Women's Facility of the Adult Correctional\r\nInstitution in Providence, Rhode Island. The remaining participants\r\nwere randomly assigned to either the control group (TAU) or to a group\r\nthat received SS treatment as an adjunct to TAU. The treatment groups\r\nwere conducted by clinicians who worked as substance abuse therapists\r\nin the Discovery Program and a clinical psychologist from Brown\r\nUniversity. All SS therapists received training in delivering SS\r\ntherapy from Dr. Lisa Najavits, who developed SS\r\ntreatment. Assessments were conducted at pretreatment, post-treatment\r\nduring incarceration, and three and six months postrelease for\r\nPTSD-related measures. Measures of severity of substance abuse and\r\nlegal problems were taken at pretreatment, as well as at the six- and\r\n12-week postrelease intervals. Measures were taken with a variety of\r\nclinical instruments, including the Addiction Severity Index (ASI),\r\nthe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) module on\r\nsubstance use, the Clinician Administered Post-Traumatic Stress\r\nDisorder Scale-I (CAPS-I), the Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ), the\r\nHelping Alliance Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II), the Client Satisfaction\r\nQuestionnaire, and the End-of-Treatment Questionnaire. Basic\r\ndemographic data were also collected from administrative\r\nrecords. Variables include alcohol, drug, and legal composite scores\r\nat pretreatment and post-treatment, number of relapses, whether the\r\nwoman returned to prison, whether the woman lied about substance\r\nabuse, use of particular substances one month prior to prison and\r\nduring lifetime, PTSD indicators of frequency and intensity, total\r\nclient satisfaction scores, patients' ratings of therapists and\r\ntreatment, and trauma scales for crime, sexual abuse, and physical\r\nabuse. Demographic variables include age, ethnic background,\r\neducation, first time in prison, the nature of the current conviction,\r\nand number of arrests with convictions.",

-            "description": "The Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency in Nashville, \r\n Tennessee, received a National Institute of Justice grant to study the \r\n effectiveness of Nashville's Juvenile Court Truancy Reduction Program (TRP). \r\n The goals of the TRP were to increase attendance and to get children \r\n safely to and from school. While habitual truancy, also referred to \r\n as chronic absenteeism, was legally defined under the Juvenile Offender Act \r\n of the State of Tennessee as five or more aggregate, unexcused absences in \r\n the course of a school year, the TRP operationally defined students at risk \r\n of truancy as those who had three unexcused absences in a school year. The \r\n intent of TRP was to intervene before the student was adjudicated habitually \r\n truant, so once a student had a third unexcused absence, the child was placed \r\n on the TRP caseload. TRP staff would then intervene with a variety of \r\n services, including home visits, community advisory boards, a suspension \r\n school, and a summer program. The evaluation study was designed to test the following \r\n hypotheses: (1) students who participated in TRP would increase their \r\n attendance rates, and (2) students who participated in TRP and other community \r\n services that were part of the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program \r\n network would increase their attendance rates at higher rates than students \r\n who participated in TRP alone. The targeted population for this study \r\n consisted of child and youth residents from five of the six public housing communities \r\n that participated in TRP. These communities also represented the public \r\n housing communities with the highest crime rates in Nashville, and  included five of the eight \r\n total family public housing developments there. All kindergarten through 8th-grade \r\n students from the targeted communities who began participating in \r\n TRP during the 1998-1999 or 1999-2000 school years were included in \r\n the study. The TRP served over 400 kindergarten through 8th-grade students during the two school years included in this study.\r\n Students who had all of the required data elements were \r\n included in the analyses. Required data elements included TRP entry \r\n date and school entry and exit dates. Students also had to have begun \r\n TRP during the study period. Variables include students' grade, gender, \r\n race, age, school enrollment date, TRP program entry date, bus eligibility, \r\n other program participation, attendance records for every school day during \r\n the two years of the study, and aggregated counts of attendance and \r\ntruant behavior.",

While habitual truancy, also referred to \r\n as chronic absenteeism, was legally defined under the Juvenile Offender Act \r\n of the State of Tennessee as five or more aggregate, unexcused absences in \r\n the course of a school year, the TRP operationally defined students at risk \r\n of truancy as those who had three unexcused absences in a school year. The \r\n intent of TRP was to intervene before the student was adjudicated habitually \r\n truant, so once a student had a third unexcused absence, the child was placed \r\n on the TRP caseload.

The unit of\r\n analysis for the study is the individual abused woman (not the\r\n neighborhood). The study takes the point of view of a woman standing\r\n at a street address and looking around her. The characteristics of the\r\n small geographical area immediately surrounding her residential\r\n address form the community context for that woman. Researchers chose\r\n the police beat as the best definition of a woman's neighborhood,\r\n because it is the smallest Chicago area for which reliable and\r\n complete data are available. The characteristics of the woman's police\r\n beat then became the community context for each woman. The beat,\r\n district, and community area of the woman's address are\r\n present. Neighborhood-level variables include voter turnout\r\n percentage, organizational involvement, percentage of households on\r\n public aid, percentage of housing that was vacant, percentage of\r\n housing units owned, percentage of feminine poverty households,\r\n assault rate, and drug crime rate. Individual-level demographic\r\n variables include the race, ethnicity, age, marital status, income,\r\n and level of education of the woman and the abuser. Other\r\n individual-level variables include the Social Support Network (SSN)\r\n scale, language the interview was conducted in, Harass score, Power\r\n and Control score, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis,\r\n other data pertaining to the respondent's emotional and physical\r\n health, and changes over the past year. Also included are details\r\n about the woman's household, such as whether she was homeless, the\r\n number of people living in the household and details about each\r\n person, the number of her children or other children in the household,\r\n details of any of her children not living in her household, and any\r\n changes in the household structure over the past year. Help-seeking in\r\n the past year includes whether the woman had sought medical care, had\r\n contacted the police, or had sought help from an agency or counselor,\r\n and whether she had an order of protection. Several variables reflect\r\n whether the woman left or tried to leave the relationship in the past\r\n year. Finally, the dataset includes summary variables about violent\r\n incidents in the past year (severity, recency, and frequency), and in\r\nthe follow-up period.",

Telephone and\r\n personal interviews were conducted with people who had experience with\r\n or knowledge of sex trafficking in the United States. This data\r\n collection consists of the verbatim questions and responses from the\r\n following groups of individuals who were interviewed: (1)\r\n international and United States women who had been or were in the sex\r\n industry in the United States, (2) law enforcement officials who had\r\n experience and expertise in sex-industry related cases or immigration,\r\n (3) social service workers who provided services to women in\r\n prostitution or might have come into contact with women from the sex\r\n industry and those providing services to immigrant populations, and\r\n (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution\r\n or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry. The\r\n research framework was developed to follow the path of trafficked\r\n women from their hometown, through their experiences in the sex\r\n industry, to their present place in life. Information was collected\r\n on trafficked women's backgrounds, roles and activities while in the\r\n sex industry, how they were controlled, and how they coped with their\r\n situations. Respondents were also asked about experiences with\r\n recruiters, traffickers, pimps, and customers. Additional information\r\n was gathered on the respondents' views on policies regarding\r\n trafficking and prostitution, the organization of the sex industry,\r\n and health and legal aspects of the business. Questionnaires for each\r\n group of interviewees were constructed according to the topics about\r\nwhich each group would most likely have knowledge or experience.",

Telephone and\r\n personal interviews were conducted with people who had experience with\r\n or knowledge of sex trafficking in the United States. This data\r\n collection consists of the verbatim questions and responses from the\r\n following groups of individuals who were interviewed: (1)\r\n international and United States women who had been or were in the sex\r\n industry in the United States, (2) law enforcement officials who had\r\n experience and expertise in sex-industry related cases or immigration,\r\n (3) social service workers who provided services to women in\r\n prostitution or might have come into contact with women from the sex\r\n industry and those providing services to immigrant populations, and\r\n (4) health care workers who provided services to women in prostitution\r\n or who may have come into contact with women in the sex industry. The\r\n research framework was developed to follow the path of trafficked\r\n women from their hometown, through their experiences in the sex\r\n industry, to their present place in life. Information was collected\r\n on trafficked women's backgrounds, roles and activities while in the\r\n sex industry, how they were controlled, and how they coped with their\r\n situations. Respondents were also asked about experiences with\r\n recruiters, traffickers, pimps, and customers. Additional information\r\n was gathered on the respondents' views on policies regarding\r\n trafficking and prostitution, the organization of the sex industry,\r\n and health and legal aspects of the business. Questionnaires for each\r\n group of interviewees were constructed according to the topics about\r\nwhich each group would most likely have knowledge or experience.",

-            "description": "This data collection effort was undertaken to analyze the\r\noutcomes of capital appeals in the United States between 1973 and 1995\r\nand as a means of assessing the reliability of death penalty verdicts\r\n(also referred to herein as \"capital judgments\" or \"death penalty\r\njudgments\") imposed under modern death-sentencing procedures. Those\r\nprocedures have been adopted since the decision in Furman v. Georgia\r\nin 1972. The United States Supreme Court's ruling in that case\r\ninvalidated all then-existing death penalty laws, determining that the\r\ndeath penalty was applied in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner and\r\nviolated Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual\r\npunishment. Data provided in this collection include state\r\ncharacteristics and the outcomes of review of death verdicts by state\r\nand year at the state direct appeal, state post-conviction, federal\r\nhabeas corpus, and all three stages of review (Part 1). Data were\r\ncompiled from published and unpublished official and archived\r\nsources. Also provided in this collection are state and county\r\ncharacteristics and the outcome of review of death verdicts by county,\r\nstate, and year at the state direct appeal, state post-conviction,\r\nfederal habeas corpus, and all three stages of review (Part 2). After\r\ndesigning a systematic method for identifying official court decisions\r\nin capital appeals and state and federal post-conviction proceedings\r\n(no official or unofficial lists of those decisions existed prior to\r\nthis study), the authors created three databases original to this\r\nstudy using information reported in those decisions. The first of the\r\nthree original databases assembled as part of this project was the\r\nDirect Appeal Database (DADB) (Part 3). This database contains\r\ninformation on the timing and outcome of decisions on state direct\r\nappeals of capital verdicts imposed in all years during the 1973-1995\r\nstudy period in which the relevant state had a valid post-Furman\r\ncapital statute. The appeals in this database include all those that\r\nwere identified as having been finally decided during the 1973 to 1995\r\nperiod (sometimes called \"the study period\"). The second original\r\ndatabase, State Post-Conviction Database (SPCDB) (Part 4), contains a\r\nlist of capital verdicts that were imposed during the years between\r\n1973 and 2000 when the relevant state had a valid post-Furman capital\r\nstatute and that were finally reversed on state post-conviction review\r\nbetween 1973 and April 2000. The third original database, Habeas\r\nCorpus Database (HCDB) (Part 5), contains information on all decisions\r\nof initial (non-successive) capital federal habeas corpus cases\r\nbetween 1973 and 1995 that finally reviewed capital verdicts imposed\r\nduring the years 1973 to 1995 when the relevant state had a valid\r\npost-Furman capital statute. Part 1 variables include state and state\r\npopulation, population density, death sentence year, year the state\r\nenacted a valid post-Furman capital statute, total homicides, number\r\nof African-Americans in the state population, number of white and\r\nAfrican-American homicide victims, number of prison inmates, number of\r\nFBI Index Crimes, number of civil, criminal, and felony court cases\r\nawaiting decision, number of death verdicts, number of Black\r\ndefendants sentenced to death, rate of white victims of homicides for\r\nwhich defendants were sentenced to death per 100 white homicide\r\nvictims, percentage of death row inmates sentenced to death for\r\noffenses against at least one white victim, number of death verdicts\r\nreviewed, awaiting review, and granted relief at all three states of\r\nreview, number of welfare recipients and welfare expenditures, direct\r\nexpenditures on the court system, party-adjusted judicial ideology\r\nindex, political pressure index, and several other created\r\nvariables. Part 2 provides this same state-level information and also\r\nprovides similar variables at the county level. Court expenditure and\r\nwelfare data are not provided in Part 2, however. Part 3 provides data\r\non each capital direct appeal decision, including state, FIPS state\r\nand county code for trial court county, year of death verdict, year of\r\ndecision, whether the verdict was affirmed or reversed, and year of\r\nfirst fully valid post-Furman statute. The date and citation for\r\nrehearing in the state system and on certiorari to the United States\r\nSupreme Court are provided in some cases. For reversals in Part 4\r\ninformation was collected about state of death verdict, FIPS state and\r\ncounty code for trial court county, year of death verdict, date of\r\nrelief, basis for reversal, stage of trial and aspect of verdict\r\n(guilty of aggravated capital murder, death sentence) affected by\r\nreversal, outcome on retrial, and citation. Part 5 variables include\r\nstate, FIPS state and county codes for trial court county, year of\r\ndeath verdict, defendant's history of alcohol or drug abuse, whether\r\nthe defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, whether the\r\ndefense attorney was from in-state, whether the defendant was\r\nconnected to the community where the crime occurred, whether the\r\nvictim had a high standing in the community, sex of the victim,\r\nwhether the defendant had a prior record, whether a state evidentiary\r\nhearing was held, number of claims for final federal decision, whether\r\na majority of the judges voting to reverse were appointed by\r\nRepublican presidents, aggravating and mitigating circumstances,\r\nwhether habeas corpus relief was granted, what claims for habeas\r\ncorpus relief were presented, and the outcome on each claim that was\r\npresented. Part 5 also includes citations to the direct appeal\r\ndecision, the state post-conviction decision (last state decision on\r\nmerits), the judicial decision at the pre-penultimate federal stage,\r\nthe decision at the penultimate federal stage, and the final federal\r\ndecision.",

Those\r\nprocedures have been adopted since the decision in Furman v. Georgia\r\nin 1972. The United States Supreme Court's ruling in that case\r\ninvalidated all then-existing death penalty laws, determining that the\r\ndeath penalty was applied in an \"arbitrary and capricious\" manner and\r\nviolated Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual\r\npunishment. Data provided in this collection include state\r\ncharacteristics and the outcomes of review of death verdicts by state\r\nand year at the state direct appeal, state post-conviction, federal\r\nhabeas corpus, and all three stages of review (Part 1). Data were\r\ncompiled from published and unpublished official and archived\r\nsources. Also provided in this collection are state and county\r\ncharacteristics and the outcome of review of death verdicts by county,\r\nstate, and year at the state direct appeal, state post-conviction,\r\nfederal habeas corpus, and all three stages of review (Part 2). After\r\ndesigning a systematic method for identifying official court decisions\r\nin capital appeals and state and federal post-conviction proceedings\r\n(no official or unofficial lists of those decisions existed prior to\r\nthis study), the authors created three databases original to this\r\nstudy using information reported in those decisions.

The specific goals of the\r\n study were: (1) to determine drop-out points along the continuum of\r\n the treatment model and to review the case files to discover any\r\n patterns in client participation and review demographic data in the\r\n program, and (2) to assess what current participants thought about the\r\n program and treatment model. For Part 1, Recent Graduate Data, data\r\n were secured from case files of women who had been discharged from the\r\n Therapeutic Community (Key Village) program in Baylor Women's\r\n Correctional Institute in 1999. This analysis was used to prepare the\r\n survey instrument used for the interviews given to the women currently\r\n participating in the program. For Part 2, Client Assessment\r\n Satisfaction Data, the current residents of the program were\r\n interviewed. During fall of 2000 and spring of 2001, a survey was\r\n developed to assess how the current participants viewed the Key\r\n Program. The questions were intended to gather information to assess\r\n the gender appropriateness of the program. A database was constructed\r\n to search for any consistencies or variables that would address the\r\n issue of gender appropriateness or lack of such in the operation of\r\n the program from the participants' point of view. During the interview\r\n period there were a total of 88 women in the Key Program. Of the 88\r\n women, 76 agreed to participate in the study. For Part 1, the\r\n variables cover demographic data, criminal history information,\r\n medical information, prior drug treatment histories, and program\r\n success or failure. Part 2 variables cover demographic information,\r\n and questions dealing with prior drug use, the first four weeks of the\r\n program, the confrontation aspects of the program, sanctions and\r\n program rules, staff/participant interaction, program activities and\r\n responsibilities as opposed to the general population, readiness for\r\n change, support systems, children's visits and children as motivation,\r\n physical aspects of the program, mental health, the need for\r\n additional vocational and educational services, significant aspects\r\nand experiences from the program, and desired changes to the program.",

-            "description": "The Criminal Justice Research Division of the San Diego\r\n Association of Governments (SANDAG) received funds from the National\r\n Institute of Justice to assist the Regional Auto Theft Task (RATT)\r\n force and evaluate the effectiveness of the program. The project\r\n involved the development of a computer system to enhance the crime\r\n analysis and mapping capabilities of RATT. Following the\r\n implementation of the new technology, the effectiveness of task force\r\n efforts was evaluated. The primary goal of the research project was to\r\n examine the effectiveness of RATT in reducing auto thefts relative to\r\n the traditional law enforcement response. In addition, the use of\r\n enhanced crime analysis information for targeting RATT investigations\r\n was assessed. This project addressed the following research questions:\r\n (1) What were the characteristics of vehicle theft rings in San Diego\r\n and how were the stolen vehicles and/or parts used, transported, and\r\n distributed? (2) What types of vehicles were targeted by vehicle theft\r\n rings and what was the modus operandi of suspects? (3) What was the\r\n extent of violence involved in motor vehicle theft incidents? (4) What\r\n was the relationship between the locations of vehicle thefts and\r\n recoveries? (5) How did investigators identify motor vehicle thefts\r\n that warranted investigation by the task force? (6) Were the\r\n characteristics of motor vehicle theft cases investigated through RATT\r\n different than other cases reported throughout the county? (7) What\r\n investigative techniques were effective in apprehending and\r\n prosecuting suspects involved in major vehicle theft operations? (8)\r\n What was the impact of enhanced crime analysis information on\r\n targeting decisions? and (9) How could public education be used to\r\n reduce the risk of motor vehicle theft? For Part 1 (Auto Theft\r\n Tracking Data), data were collected from administrative records to\r\n track auto theft cases in San Diego County. The data were used to\r\n identify targets of enforcement efforts (e.g., auto theft rings,\r\n career auto thieves), techniques or strategies used, the length of\r\n investigations, involvement of outside agencies, property recovered,\r\n condition of recoveries, and consequences to offenders that resulted\r\n from the activities of the investigations. Data were compiled for all\r\n 194 cases investigated by RATT in fiscal year 1993 to 1994 (the\r\n experimental group) and compared to a random sample of 823 cases\r\n investigated through the traditional law enforcement response during\r\n the same time period (the comparison group). The research staff also\r\n conducted interviews with task force management (Parts 2 and 3,\r\n Investigative Operations Committee Initial Interview Data and\r\n Investigative Operations Committee Follow-Up Interview Data) and other\r\n task force members (Parts 4 and 5, Staff Initial Interview Data and\r\n Staff Follow-Up Interview Data) at two time periods to address the\r\n following issues: (1) task force goals, (2) targets, (3) methods of\r\n identifying targets, (4) differences between RATT strategies and the\r\n traditional law enforcement response to auto theft, (5) strategies\r\n employed, (6) geographic concentrations of auto theft, (7) factors\r\n that enhance or impede investigations, (8) opinions regarding\r\n effective approaches, (9) coordination among agencies, (10)\r\n suggestions for improving task force operations, (11) characteristics\r\n of auto theft rings, (12) training received, (13) resources and\r\n information needed, (14) measures of success, and (15) suggestions for\r\n public education efforts. Variables in Part 1 include the total number\r\n of vehicles and suspects involved in an incident, whether informants\r\n were used to solve the case, whether the stolen vehicle was used to\r\n buy parts, drugs, or weapons, whether there was a search warrant or an\r\n arrest warrant, whether officers used surveillance equipment,\r\n addresses of theft and recovery locations, date of theft and recovery,\r\n make and model of the stolen car, condition of vehicle when recovered,\r\n property recovered, whether an arrest was made, the arresting agency,\r\n date of arrest, arrest charges, number and type of charges filed,\r\n disposition, conviction charges, number of convictions, and\r\n sentence. Demographic variables include the age, sex, and race of the\r\n suspect, if known. Variables in Parts 2 and 3 include the goals of\r\n RATT, how the program evolved, the role of the IOC, how often the IOC\r\n met, the relationship of the IOC and the executive committee, how RATT\r\n was unique, why RATT was successful, how RATT could be improved, how\r\n RATT was funded, and ways in which auto theft could be\r\n reduced. Variables in Parts 4 and 5 include the goals of RATT, sources\r\n of information about vehicle thefts, strategies used to solve auto\r\n theft cases, location of most vehicle thefts, how motor vehicle thefts\r\n were impacted by RATT, impediments to the RATT program, suggestions\r\n for improving the program, ways in which auto theft could be reduced,\r\n and methods to educate citizens about auto theft. In addition, Part 5\r\n also has variables about the type of officers' training, usefulness of\r\n maps and other data, descriptions of auto theft rings in terms of the\r\n age, race, and gender of its members, and types of cars stolen by\r\nrings.",

(2) Should investigating and \r\n prosecuting white-collar crime be a central way of proceeding against \r\n organized criminal groups?

The data addressed the\r\n following questions: (1) To what extent does arrest decrease the\r\n likelihood of continued violence, as assessed by the victim? (2) To\r\n what extent does arrest decrease the likelihood of continued\r\n complaints of crime, as assessed by police records? (3) What are the\r\n differences in arrest recidivism between cases that involved arrest\r\n versus cases that involved mediation, separation, warrant issued, or\r\n no warrant issued? Domestic violence cases in three sectors of Omaha,\r\n Nebraska, meeting established eligibility criteria, were assigned to\r\n one of five experimental treatments: mediation, separation, arrest,\r\n warrant issued, or no warrant issued. Data for victim reports were\r\n collected from three interviews with the victims conducted one week,\r\n six months, and 12 months after the domestic violence incident.\r\n Arrest, charge, and complaint data were collected on the suspects at\r\n six- and twelve-month intervals following the original domestic\r\n violence incident. The investigators used arrest recidivism, continued\r\n complaints of crime, and victim reports of repeated violence (fear of\r\n injury, pushing/hitting, and physical injury) as outcome measures to\r\n assess the extent to which treatments prevented subsequent conflicts.\r\n Other variables include victim's level of fear, self-esteem, locus of\r\n control, and welfare dependency, changes in the relationship between\r\n suspect and victim, extent of the victim's injury, and extent of drug\r\n use by the victim and the suspect. Demographic variables include\r\nrace, age, sex, income, occupational status, and marital status.",

The data addressed the\r\n following questions: (1) To what extent does arrest decrease the\r\n likelihood of continued violence, as assessed by the victim? (2) To\r\n what extent does arrest decrease the likelihood of continued\r\n complaints of crime, as assessed by police records? (3) What are the\r\n differences in arrest recidivism between cases that involved arrest\r\n versus cases that involved mediation, separation, warrant issued, or\r\n no warrant issued? Domestic violence cases in three sectors of Omaha,\r\n Nebraska, meeting established eligibility criteria, were assigned to\r\n one of five experimental treatments: mediation, separation, arrest,\r\n warrant issued, or no warrant issued. Data for victim reports were\r\n collected from three interviews with the victims conducted one week,\r\n six months, and 12 months after the domestic violence incident.\r\n Arrest, charge, and complaint data were collected on the suspects at\r\n six- and twelve-month intervals following the original domestic\r\n violence incident. The investigators used arrest recidivism, continued\r\n complaints of crime, and victim reports of repeated violence (fear of\r\n injury, pushing/hitting, and physical injury) as outcome measures to\r\n assess the extent to which treatments prevented subsequent conflicts.\r\n Other variables include victim's level of fear, self-esteem, locus of\r\n control, and welfare dependency, changes in the relationship between\r\n suspect and victim, extent of the victim's injury, and extent of drug\r\n use by the victim and the suspect. Demographic variables include\r\nrace, age, sex, income, occupational status, and marital status.",

-            "description": "The purpose of the study was to provide empirical data to inform the debate and lead to meaningful answers to questions in custody mediation and domestic violence including equity of outcomes for families with partner violence versus those without any evidence of violence, and the issue of health and safety outcomes for the children. Researchers examined every seventh action filed in the Family Court in San Diego during the calendar year 1996. Each of the 512 nonagreement mediation reports and its associated Court Screening Form were scanned in its entirety and subsequently printed. Each report also contained an appended page, containing a detailed parenting plan in which the mediator summarized the percentage of physical custody recommended for each parent. Each report was studied and content analyzed by three trained raters who had no access to the Court Screening Form and so were blind to any a prior domestic violence allegations. The majority of coding items called for yes/no responses. Other coding items allowed the raters to choose from among more than two options. A variable was coded in a particular direction if all three raters agreed or if two of the three raters agreed. The domestic violence sample (n = 200) included all of the selected cases with domestic violence indicators on the current screening form, prior allegation of domestic violence on a court screening form and/or a permanent domestic violence restraining order in the case file that was available to the mediator, and clear cases of domestic violence as documented by the mediator in which there was absolutely no indication of domestic violence on any screening form or in the case file. The nondomestic violence sample (n = 200) included 200 of the remaining 312 cases that had no indicators of domestic violence in the file and no mention of domestic violence in the mediation report.

Researchers examined every seventh action filed in the Family Court in San Diego during the calendar year 1996. Each of the 512 nonagreement mediation reports and its associated Court Screening Form were scanned in its entirety and subsequently printed. Each report also contained an appended page, containing a detailed parenting plan in which the mediator summarized the percentage of physical custody recommended for each parent. Each report was studied and content analyzed by three trained raters who had no access to the Court Screening Form and so were blind to any a prior domestic violence allegations. The majority of coding items called for yes/no responses. Other coding items allowed the raters to choose from among more than two options. A variable was coded in a particular direction if all three raters agreed or if two of the three raters agreed.

-            "description": "This project provided the first large-scale examination of the police response to intimate partner violence and of the practice known as \"dual arrest.\"  The objectives of the project were: (1) to describe the prevalence and context of dual arrest in the United States, (2) to explain the variance in dual arrest rates throughout the United States, (3) to describe dual arrest within the full range of the police response to intimate partner violence, (4) to analyze the factors associated with no arrest, single arrest, and dual arrest, (5) to examine the reasons why women are arrested in intimate partner cases, and (6) to describe how the criminal justice system treats women who have been arrested for domestic violence.  Data for the project were collected in two phases. In Phase I, researchers examined all assault and intimidation cases in the year 2000 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) database (NATIONAL INCIDENT-BASED REPORTING SYSTEM, 2000 [ICPSR 3449]) to investigate the extent to which dual arrest is occurring nationwide, the relationship between incident and offender characteristics, and the effect of state laws on police handling of these cases for all relationship types. Because the NIBRS dataset contained a limited number of incident-specific variables that helped explain divergent arrest practices, in Phase II, researchers collected more detailed information on a subset of NIBRS cases from 25 police departments of varying sizes across four states. This phase of the study was restricted to intimate partner and other domestic violence cases. Additional data were collected for these cases to evaluate court case outcomes and subsequent re-offending. This phase also included an assessment of how closely department policy reflected state law in a larger sample of agencies within five states. The data in Part 1 (Phase I Data) contain 577,862 records from the NIBRS. This includes information related to domestic violence incidents such as the most serious offense against the victim, the most serious victim injury, the assault type, date of incident, and the counts of offenses, offenders, victims, and arrests for the incident. The data also include information related to the parties involved in the incident including demographics for the victim(s) and arrestee(s) and the relationship between victim(s) and arrestee(s). There is also information related to the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred such as population, urban/rural classification, and whether the jurisdiction is located in a metropolitan area.  There are also variables pertaining to whether a weapon was used, the date of arrest, and the type of arrest.  Also included are variables regarding the police department such as the number of male and female police officers and civilians employed. The data in Part 2 (Phase II Data) contain 4,388 cases and include all of the same variables as those in Part 1. In addition to these variables, there are variables such as whether the offender was on the scene when the police arrived, who reported the incident, the exact nature of injuries suffered by the involved parties, victim and offender substance use, offender demeanor, and presence of children. Also included are variables related to the number of people including police and civilians who were on the scene, the number of people who were questioned, whether there were warrants for the victim(s) or offender(s), whether citations were issued, whether arrests were made, whether any cases were prosecuted, the number of charges filed and against whom, and the sentences for prosecuted cases that resulted in conviction. The data in Part 3 (Police Department Policy Data) contain 282 cases and include variables regarding whether the department had a domestic violence policy, what the department's arrest policy was, whether a police report needed to be made, whether the policy addressed mutual violence, whether the policy instructed how to determine the primary aggressor, and what factors were taken into account in making a decision to arrest. There is also information related to the proportion of arrests involving intimate partners, the proportion of arrests involving other domestics, the proportion of arrests involving acquaintances, and the proportion of arrests involving strangers.",

One was a traditional office, and the other was a more community-oriented office. Each site submitted monthly data on the identified performance measures for analysis. APRI also designed and administered a public safety survey to assess a number of factors related to the performance of prosecutors' offices, but for which data could not be provided by the offices. The public safety surveys were administered by phone using random digit dialing (RDD). Part 1, Site 1 Administrative Data, contains 15 months of data, and Part 2, Site 2 Administrative Data, contain 6 months of data on the identified performance measures for analysis from each site. Part 3, Public Safety Survey Data, contains variables that provide some basic demographic data about the respondents and several variables in response to Likert-style questions measuring attitudes and opinions on six factors.

Different versions of the telephone survey were created for the key categories of law enforcement targeted by this study (state/local investigators, police offices, victim witness coordinators, and federal agents). The telephone surveys were supplemented with interviews from law enforcement supervisors/managers, representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Human Trafficking/Smuggling Office, the United States Attorney's Office, the Trafficking in Persons Office, and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division. Respondents were asked about their history of working human trafficking cases, knowledge of human trafficking, and familiarity with the TVPA. Other variables include the type of trafficking victims encountered, how human trafficking cases were identified, and the law enforcement agency's capability to address the issue of trafficking. The respondents were also asked about the challenges and barriers to investigating human trafficking cases and to providing services to the victims. In the second phase of the study (Part 2, Case File Review Qualitative Data) researchers collected comprehensive case information from sources such as case reports, sanitized court reports, legal newspapers, magazines, and newsletters, as well as law review articles. This case review examined nine prosecuted cases of human trafficking since the passage of the TVPA.

In small group testing sessions, participants completed assessments of several personality factors, justification of aggression, self-esteem, other-esteem, and aggression. Participants also completed the hypothetical situations task in which they assessed the provocateur's intent and their own likely response in each. For Part 2 (Adolescent Data), participants included 184 adolescents who were between the ages of 14 and 17 and enrolled at a suburban high school in upstate New York in 2003 and 2004. Adolescents were recruited to participate in a study of relationships and problem solving through announcements made by the researcher in the students' homeroom.

The population from which the sample was selected consisted of all police complaint numbers for cases involving domestic violence (DV) in 2003. The unit of analysis was therefore the domestic violence incident. Cases were selected using a randomized stratified sample (stratifying by month) that also triple-sampled DV Unit cases, which generated 255 DV Unit cases for inclusion. The final sample therefore consists of 891 domestic violence cases, each involving one victim and one suspect. Within this final sample of cases, 25 percent were processed by the DV Unit. The data file contains data from multiple sources. Included from the police department's computerized database (KBCOPS) are variables pertaining to the nature of the crime, victim information and suspect information such as suspect and victim demographic data, victim/offender relationship, highest offense category, weapon usage, victim injury, and case disposition status. From police narratives come such variables as victim/offender relationship, weapon use (more refined than what is included in KBCOPS data), victim injury (also a more refined measure), and evidence collected. Variables from tracking data include information regarding the nature of the offense, the level/type of harm inflicted, and if the assault involved the same victim in the sample. Variables such as amount of jail time a suspect may have had, information pertaining to the court charges (as opposed to the charges at arrest) and case disposition status are included from court and jail data.",

The population from which the sample was selected consisted of all police complaint numbers for cases involving domestic violence (DV) in 2003. The unit of analysis was therefore the domestic violence incident. Cases were selected using a randomized stratified sample (stratifying by month) that also triple-sampled DV Unit cases, which generated 255 DV Unit cases for inclusion. The final sample therefore consists of 891 domestic violence cases, each involving one victim and one suspect. Within this final sample of cases, 25 percent were processed by the DV Unit. The data file contains data from multiple sources. Included from the police department's computerized database (KBCOPS) are variables pertaining to the nature of the crime, victim information and suspect information such as suspect and victim demographic data, victim/offender relationship, highest offense category, weapon usage, victim injury, and case disposition status. From police narratives come such variables as victim/offender relationship, weapon use (more refined than what is included in KBCOPS data), victim injury (also a more refined measure), and evidence collected. Variables from tracking data include information regarding the nature of the offense, the level/type of harm inflicted, and if the assault involved the same victim in the sample. Variables such as amount of jail time a suspect may have had, information pertaining to the court charges (as opposed to the charges at arrest) and case disposition status are included from court and jail data.",

-            "description": "The Urban Institute established the Reentry Mapping Network (RMN), a group of jurisdictions applying a data-driven, spatial approach to prisoner reentry. The purpose of the study was to examine three National Institute of Justice-funded RMN sites: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Washington, DC, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  As members of the Reentry Mapping Network, the three sites collected local data related to incarceration, reentry, and community well-being. The Nonprofit Center of Milwaukee's Neighborhood Data Center was the lead Reentry Mapping Network partner in Milwaukee.  Data on a total of 168 census tracts in Milwaukee (Part 1) during the calendar year 2003 were obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections.  NeighborhoodInfo DC was the lead reentry mapping network partner in Washington, DC.  Data on a total of 7,286 ex-offenders in Washington, DC (Part 2) during the calendar year 2004 were obtained from the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia.  The Winston-Salem Reentry Mapping Network project was managed by the Center for Community Safety (CCS), a public service and research center of Winston-Salem State University. Data on a total of 2,896 ex-offenders in Forsyth County (Part 3) during the calendar year 2003 were obtained from the North Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC), the Forsyth County Sheriff's Department (Forsyth County Detention Center [FCDC]), and the North Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (DJJDP).  The Milwaukee, Wisconsin Data (Part 1) contain a total of 95 variables including race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, education, job status, dependents, general risk assessment, alcohol risk, drug risk, need for alcohol treatment, and need for drug treatment. Also included are four geographic variables. The Washington, DC Data (Part 2) contain a total of 13 variables including supervision type, whether supervision began in calendar year 2004, date supervision period began, date supervision period ended, sex, marital status, ethnicity, age, education, unemployment status, state, and Census tract. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina Data (Part 3) contain a total of 14 variables including race, sex, primary offense, admittance date, date pardoned, street, city, state, status, jurisdiction, and age at admission.",
