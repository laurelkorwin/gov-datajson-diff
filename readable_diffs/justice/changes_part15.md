-            "description": "In 1996 the Institute for Law and Justice (ILJ) began an\r\nevaluation of the law enforcement and prosecution components of the\r\n\"STOP Violence Against Women\" grant program authorized by the Violence\r\nAgainst Women Act of 1994. This data collection constitutes one\r\ncomponent of the evaluation. The researchers chose to evaluate two\r\nspecialized units and two multi-agency team projects in order to study\r\nthe local impact of STOP on victim safety and offender\r\naccountability. The two specialized units reflected typical STOP\r\nfunding, with money being used for the addition of one or two\r\ndedicated professionals in each community. The Dane County, Wisconsin,\r\nSheriff's Office used STOP funds to support the salaries of two\r\ndomestic violence detectives. This project was evaluated through\r\nsurveys of domestic violence victims served by the Dane County\r\nSheriff's Office (Part 1). In Stark County, Ohio, the Office of the\r\nProsecutor used STOP funds to support the salary of a designated\r\nfelony domestic violence prosecutor. The Stark County project was\r\nevaluated by tracking domestic violence cases filed with the\r\nprosecutor's office. The case tracking system included only cases\r\ninvolving intimate partner violence, with a male offender and female\r\nvictim. All domestic violence felons from 1996 were tracked from\r\narrest to disposition and sentence (Part 2). This pre-grant group of\r\nfelons was compared with a sample of cases from 1999 (Part 3). In\r\nHillsborough County, New Hampshire, a comprehensive evaluation\r\nstrategy was used to assess the impact of the use of STOP funds on\r\ndomestic violence cases. First, a sample of 1996 pre-grant and 1999\r\npost-grant domestic violence cases was tracked from arrest to\r\ndisposition for both regular domestic violence cases (Part 4) and also\r\nfor dual arrest cases (Part 5). Second, a content analysis of police\r\nincident reports from pre- and post-grant periods was carried out to\r\ngauge any changes in report writing (Part 6). Finally, interviews were\r\nconducted with victims to document their experiences with the criminal\r\njustice system, and to better understand the factors that contribute\r\nto victim safety and well-being (Part 7). In Jackson County, Missouri,\r\nevaluation methods included reviews of prosecutor case files and\r\ntracking all sex crimes referred to the Jackson County Prosecutor's\r\nOffice over both pre-grant and post-grant periods (Part 8). The\r\nevaluation also included personal interviews with female victims (Part\r\n9). Variables in Part 1 (Dane County Victim Survey Data) describe the\r\nrelationship of the victim and offender, injuries sustained, who\r\ncalled the police and when, how the police responded to the victim and\r\nthe situation, how the detective contacted the victim, and services\r\nprovided by the detective. Part 2 (1996 Stark County Case Tracking\r\nData), Part 3 (1999 Stark County Case Tracking Data), Part 4\r\n(Hillsborough County Regular Case Tracking Data), Part 5 (Hillsborough\r\nCounty Dual Arrest Case Tracking Data), and Part 8 (Jackson County\r\nCase Tracking Data) include variables on substance abuse by victim\r\nand offender, use of weapons, law enforcement response, primary arrest\r\noffense, whether children were present, injuries sustained, indictment\r\ncharge, pre-sentence investigation, victim impact statement, arrest\r\nand trial dates, disposition, sentence, and court costs. Demographic\r\nvariables include the age, sex, and ethnicity of the victim and the\r\noffender. Variables in Part 6 (Hillsborough County Police Report\r\nData) provide information on whether there was an existing protective\r\norder, whether the victim was interviewed separately, severity of\r\ninjuries, seizure of weapons, witnesses present, involvement of\r\nchildren, and demeanor of suspect and victim. In Part 7 (Hillsborough\r\nCounty Victim Interview Data) variables focus on whether victims had\r\nprior experience with the court, type of physical abuse experienced,\r\ninjuries from abuse, support from relatives, friends, neighbors,\r\ndoctor, religious community, or police, assistance from police,\r\nsatisfaction with police response, expectations about case outcome,\r\nwhy the victim dropped the charges, contact with the prosecutor,\r\ncriminal justice advocate, and judge, and the outcome of the\r\ncase. Demographic variables include age, race, number of children, and\r\noccupation. Variables in Part 9 (Jackson County Victim Interview Data)\r\nrelate to when victims were sexually assaulted, if they knew the\r\nperpetrator, who was contacted to help, victims' opinions about police\r\nand detectives who responded to the case, contact with the prosecutor\r\nand victim's advocate, and aspects of the medical\r\nexamination. Demographic variables include age, race, and marital\r\nstatus.",

The main objective of the first year of the project was to\r\ndetermine if that instrument was culturally appropriate for the jailed\r\nAmerican Indian population. The principal objective of the second year\r\nof the project was to determine whether the employment of different\r\nsuicide screening protocols would make a difference in the responses\r\nof new detainees with regard to the likelihood of securing their\r\nhonest reports of experiencing suicide ideation and its associated\r\nrisk factors. For the duration of the project, all male and female\r\ninmates aged 18 and older who were booked into the jail went through\r\nthe customary booking procedure that included the administration of\r\nthe New York Suicide Prevention Screening Guidelines. In the first\r\nyear of the project, researchers also administered a short self-report\r\nsurvey consisting of measures commonly associated with suicidal\r\nideation. The self-report survey measured stress, anxiety, suicide\r\nideation, hopelessness, and suicidal behavior history. The protocols\r\nin the second year of the project reflected efforts to test different\r\nscreening conditions for four experimental groups and one control\r\ngroup of new detainees. The outcome variables of the short self-report\r\nsurvey consisted of measures of demographics, comfort experience\r\nduring booking and the screening process, self-efficacy and management\r\nof depression, knowledge of mental health support available within the\r\njail, and general well-being. In addition to the quantitative data\r\ncollection, qualitative data were also collected to develop a\r\nstraightforward assessment of suicide ideation criteria in this\r\nspecific jail setting using semi-structured focus group interviews.",

First, the study sought to provide forecasts of\r\nfuture demands on the federal courts while reducing forecasting errors\r\nby taking account of the time series properties of the case data. The\r\nresearchers constructed a comprehensive dataset based on annual\r\naggregated civil and criminal case volumes of individual federal\r\ndistrict courts spanning the period 1904-1998, for a total of 95\r\nyearly observations. Secondly, the study specified and estimated\r\nmultivariate econometric models of the determinants of civil case\r\nfilings over time and across geographic space using panel data\r\ntechniques. These empirical models were run on three alternative\r\ndatasets consisting of observations on statewide, districtwide, and\r\ncircuitwide United States civil, private civil, and total civil cases\r\nper capita, over the period 1960 to 1998. The empirical models\r\nincluded standard socioeconomic variables, such as income, population\r\ndensity, and race, along with variables that controlled for fixed\r\neffects associated with the courts' geographic location. The study\r\nalso addressed the pressing issue of allocating judgeships across\r\ncircuits and districts. Variables include total civil and criminal\r\ncases, percentage of minority population, unemployment rate,\r\npercentage of drug and immigration cases, annual unweighted and\r\nweighted total case filings per judge, and annual civil and criminal\r\ncase filings per judge.",

In 1990, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency\r\n Prevention (OJJDP) launched a demonstration program to develop boot\r\n camp models for juveniles and to test the feasibility and\r\n appropriateness of their implementation. In September 1991, three\r\n groups received awards to develop and implement boot camps as\r\n intermediate sanctions: the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas in\r\n Cleveland, Ohio, the Colorado Division of Youth Services in Denver,\r\n Colorado, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Mobile,\r\n Alabama. Simultaneously, the National Institute of Justice sponsored\r\n an evaluation of the implementation of the demonstration programs,\r\n focusing on the experiences of youths who entered the program during\r\n the first year of operation, from 1992 to 1993. This collection\r\n contains data from the program evaluation conducted on these three\r\n boot camps during the first year. The core of the assessment was a\r\n management information system that captured administrative data as the\r\n offenders progressed through the demonstration program. At intake,\r\n researchers collected demographic, criminal, and family and social\r\n information. Demographic information collected at intake includes age,\r\n race, education, and employment. Criminal data covers criminal\r\n history, current offense, and case information, while family and\r\n social history variables include whether the youths' parents had a\r\n criminal record, whether their family received public assistance, and\r\n whether they had delinquent friends, delinquent siblings, discipline\r\n problems at home or school, or a history of psychological problems.\r\n At the beginning and end of the boot camp term, staff rated the\r\n youths' performance on educational and behavioral measures. The\r\n youths were also surveyed about the rules of boot camp, their opinions\r\n of instructors, and their self-esteem, drug and alcohol use, and\r\n criminal behavior. At the end of the first 90 days (the residential\r\n period), data were collected on the date of graduation, infractions\r\n during boot camp, honors or awards, and special services\r\n received.

-            "description": "Despite the fact that most states enacted rape reform\r\nlegislation by the mid-1980s, empirical research on the effect of\r\nthese laws was conducted in only four states and for a limited time\r\nspan following the reform. The purpose of this study was to provide\r\nboth increased breadth and depth of information about the effect of\r\nthe rape law changes and the legal issues that surround them. Statistical data on all rape cases between 1970\r\nand 1985 in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia, and\r\nWashington, DC, were collected from court records. Monthly time-series\r\nanalyses were used to assess the impact of the reforms on rape\r\nreporting, indictments, convictions, incarcerations, and\r\nsentences. The study also sought to determine if particular changes,\r\nor particular combinations of changes, affected the case processing\r\nand disposition of sexual assault cases and whether the effect of the\r\nreforms varied with the comprehensiveness of the changes. In each\r\njurisdiction, data were collected on all forcible rape cases for which\r\nan indictment or information was filed. In addition to forcible rape,\r\nother felony sexual assaults that did not involve children were\r\nincluded. The names and definitions of these crimes varied from\r\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. To compare the pattern of rape reports\r\nwith general crime trends, reports of robbery and felony assaults\r\nduring the same general time period were also obtained from the\r\nUniform Crime Reports (UCR) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nwhen available. For the adjudicated case data (Parts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,\r\nand 11), variables include month and year of offense, indictment,\r\ndisposition, four most serious offenses charged, total number of\r\ncharges indicted, four most serious conviction charges, total number\r\nof conviction charges, type of disposition, type of sentence, and\r\nmaximum jail or prison sentence. The time series data (Parts 2, 4, 6,\r\n8, 10, and 12) provide year and month of indictment, total indictments\r\nfor rape only and for all sex offenses, total convictions and\r\nincarcerations for all rape cases in the month, for those on the\r\noriginal rape charge, for all sex offenses in the month, and for those\r\non the original sex offense charge, percents for each indictment,\r\nconviction, and incarceration category, the average maximum sentence\r\nfor each incarceration category, and total police reports of forcible\r\nrape in the month. Interviews were also conducted in each site with\r\njudges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, and this information is\r\npresented in Part 13. These interviewees were asked to rate the importance\r\nof various types of evidence in sexual assault cases and to respond to\r\na series of six hypothetical cases in which evidence of the victim's past\r\nsexual history was at issue. Respondents were also presented with a\r\nhypothetical case for which some factors were varied to create 12 different\r\nscenarios, and they were asked to make a set\r\nof judgments about each. Interview\r\ndata also include respondent's title, sex, race, age, number of years\r\nin office, and whether the respondent was in office before and/or after the\r\nreform.",

The purpose of this study was to provide\r\nboth increased breadth and depth of information about the effect of\r\nthe rape law changes and the legal issues that surround them. Statistical data on all rape cases between 1970\r\nand 1985 in Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia, and\r\nWashington, DC, were collected from court records. Monthly time-series\r\nanalyses were used to assess the impact of the reforms on rape\r\nreporting, indictments, convictions, incarcerations, and\r\nsentences. The study also sought to determine if particular changes,\r\nor particular combinations of changes, affected the case processing\r\nand disposition of sexual assault cases and whether the effect of the\r\nreforms varied with the comprehensiveness of the changes. In each\r\njurisdiction, data were collected on all forcible rape cases for which\r\nan indictment or information was filed. In addition to forcible rape,\r\nother felony sexual assaults that did not involve children were\r\nincluded. The names and definitions of these crimes varied from\r\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. To compare the pattern of rape reports\r\nwith general crime trends, reports of robbery and felony assaults\r\nduring the same general time period were also obtained from the\r\nUniform Crime Reports (UCR) from the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nwhen available. For the adjudicated case data (Parts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,\r\nand 11), variables include month and year of offense, indictment,\r\ndisposition, four most serious offenses charged, total number of\r\ncharges indicted, four most serious conviction charges, total number\r\nof conviction charges, type of disposition, type of sentence, and\r\nmaximum jail or prison sentence. The time series data (Parts 2, 4, 6,\r\n8, 10, and 12) provide year and month of indictment, total indictments\r\nfor rape only and for all sex offenses, total convictions and\r\nincarcerations for all rape cases in the month, for those on the\r\noriginal rape charge, for all sex offenses in the month, and for those\r\non the original sex offense charge, percents for each indictment,\r\nconviction, and incarceration category, the average maximum sentence\r\nfor each incarceration category, and total police reports of forcible\r\nrape in the month. Interviews were also conducted in each site with\r\njudges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys, and this information is\r\npresented in Part 13. These interviewees were asked to rate the importance\r\nof various types of evidence in sexual assault cases and to respond to\r\na series of six hypothetical cases in which evidence of the victim's past\r\nsexual history was at issue. Respondents were also presented with a\r\nhypothetical case for which some factors were varied to create 12 different\r\nscenarios, and they were asked to make a set\r\nof judgments about each. Interview\r\ndata also include respondent's title, sex, race, age, number of years\r\nin office, and whether the respondent was in office before and/or after the\r\nreform.",

The Association of the Bar of the City of\r\n New York and the Drug Abuse Council jointly organized a joint\r\n committee and a research project to collect data, in a systematic\r\n fashion, (1) to ascertain the repercussions of the drug law revision,\r\n (2) to analyze, to the degree possible, why the law was revised, and\r\n (3) to identify any general principles or specific lessons that could\r\n be derived from the New York experience that could be helpful to other\r\n states as they dealt with the problem of illegal drug use and related\r\n crime. This data collection contains five files from the study. Part 1\r\n contains information gathered in a survey investigating the effects of\r\n the 1973 predicate felony provisions on crime committed by repeat\r\n offenders. Data include sex, age at first arrest, county and year of\r\n sampled felony conviction, subsequent arrests up to December 1976,\r\n time between arrests, time incarcerated between arrests, and number\r\n and type of short-span arrests and incarcerations. Part 2 contains\r\n data gathered in a survey meant to estimate the number and proportion\r\n of felony crimes attributable to narcotics users in Manhattan. Case\r\n records for male defendants, aged 16 and older, who were arraigned on\r\n at least one felony charge in Manhattan's Criminal Court, in 1972 and\r\n 1975, were sampled. Data include original and reduced charges and\r\n penal code numbers, and indicators of first, second, third, and fourth\r\n drug status. Part 3 contains data gathered in a survey designed to\r\n estimate the number and proportion of felony crimes attributable to\r\n narcotics users in Manhattan. Case records for male defendants, aged\r\n 16 and older, who were arraigned on at least one felony charge in\r\n Manhattan's Criminal Court or Manhattan's Supreme Court, were sampled\r\n from 1971 through 1975. Eighty percent of the sample was drawn from\r\n the Criminal Court while the remaining 20 percent was taken from the\r\n Supreme Court. Data include date of arraignment, age, number of\r\n charges, penal code numbers for first six charges, bail information\r\n (e.g., if it was set, amount, and date bail made), disposition and\r\n sentence, indications of first through fourth drug status, first\r\n through third drug of abuse, and treatment status of defendant. Part 4\r\n contains data gathered in a survey that determined the extent of\r\n knowledge of the 1973 drug law among ex-drug users in drug treatment\r\n programs, and to discover any changes in their behavior in response to\r\n the new law. Interviews were administered to non-randomly selected\r\n volunteers from three modalities: residential drug-free, ambulatory\r\n methadone maintenance, and the detoxification unit of the New York\r\n City House of Detention for Men. Data include sources of knowledge of\r\n drug laws (e.g., from media, subway posters, police, friends, dealers,\r\n and treatment programs), average length of sentence for various drug\r\n convictions, maximum sentence for such crimes, the pre-1974 sentence\r\n for such crimes, type of plea bargaining done, and respondent's\r\n opinion of the effects of the new law on police activity, the street,\r\n conviction rates, and drug use. Part 5 contains data from a survey\r\n that estimated the number and proportion of felony crimes attributable\r\n to narcotics users in Manhattan. Detained males aged 16 and older in\r\n Manhattan pre-trial detention centers who faced at least one current\r\n felony charge were sampled. Data include date of admission and\r\n discharge, drug status and charges, penal code numbers for first\r\n through sixth charge, bail information, and drug status and\r\ntreatment.",

The Association of the Bar of the City of\r\n New York and the Drug Abuse Council jointly organized a joint\r\n committee and a research project to collect data, in a systematic\r\n fashion, (1) to ascertain the repercussions of the drug law revision,\r\n (2) to analyze, to the degree possible, why the law was revised, and\r\n (3) to identify any general principles or specific lessons that could\r\n be derived from the New York experience that could be helpful to other\r\n states as they dealt with the problem of illegal drug use and related\r\n crime. This data collection contains five files from the study. Part 1\r\n contains information gathered in a survey investigating the effects of\r\n the 1973 predicate felony provisions on crime committed by repeat\r\n offenders. Data include sex, age at first arrest, county and year of\r\n sampled felony conviction, subsequent arrests up to December 1976,\r\n time between arrests, time incarcerated between arrests, and number\r\n and type of short-span arrests and incarcerations. Part 2 contains\r\n data gathered in a survey meant to estimate the number and proportion\r\n of felony crimes attributable to narcotics users in Manhattan. Case\r\n records for male defendants, aged 16 and older, who were arraigned on\r\n at least one felony charge in Manhattan's Criminal Court, in 1972 and\r\n 1975, were sampled. Data include original and reduced charges and\r\n penal code numbers, and indicators of first, second, third, and fourth\r\n drug status.

The Hartford Project was an experiment\r\nin how to reduce residential burglary and street robbery/purse snatching\r\nand the fear of those crimes. Funded through the Hartford Institute of\r\nCriminal and Social Justice, the project began in 1973. It was based\r\non a new \"environmental\" approach to crime prevention: a comprehensive\r\nand integrative view addressing not only the relationship among\r\ncitizens, police, and offenders, but also the effect of the physical\r\nenvironment on their attitudes and behavior. The surveys were\r\nadministered by the Center for Survey Research at the University of\r\nMassachusetts at Boston. The Center collected Hartford resident survey\r\ndata in five different years: 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. The\r\n1973 survey provided basic data for problem analysis and\r\nplanning. These data were updated twice: in 1975 to gather baseline\r\ndata for the time of program implementation, and in the spring of 1976\r\nwith a survey of households in one targeted neighborhood of Hartford\r\nto provide data for the time of implementation of physical changes\r\nthere. Program evaluation surveys were carried out in the spring of\r\n1977 and two years later in 1979. The procedures for each survey were\r\nessentially identical each year in order to ensure comparability\r\nacross time. The one exception was the 1976 sample, which was not\r\nindependent of the one taken in 1975. In each survey except 1979,\r\nrespondents reported on experiences during the preceding 12-month\r\nperiod. In 1979 the time reference was the past two years. The survey\r\nquestions were very similar from year to year, with 1973 being the most\r\nunique. All surveys focused on victimization, fear, and perceived risk\r\nof being victims of the target crimes. Other questions explored\r\nperceptions of and attitudes toward police, neighborhood problems, and\r\nneighbors. The surveys also included questions on household and\r\nrespondent characteristics.",

The\r\nstudy was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Law\r\nEnforcement and Criminal Justice of the Law Enforcement Assistance\r\nAdministration, United States Department of Justice. Parts 1-3,\r\nDefendants, Victims, and Police files, consist of responses to questionnaires\r\ngiven to defendants, victims, and police. The questionnaires were\r\nadministered during 20-minute interviews, conducted after the case had\r\nbeen completed. The interview instruments were designed to collect\r\ndata on three major issues: (1) the extent to which respondents\r\nreported participation in the processing of their cases, (2)\r\nrespondents' knowledge of the way their cases were processed, and (3)\r\nrespondents' attitudes toward the disposition of their cases and\r\ntoward the criminal justice system. Part 4 is the Conference Data\r\nFile. During the pretrial settlement conference, an observer wrote down\r\nin sequence as much as possible of the verbal behavior. After the\r\nsession, the observer made some subjective ratings, provided\r\ndescriptive data about the conclusion of the session, and classified\r\ncomments into one of the following categories: (1) Facts of\r\nthe Case, (2) Prior Record, (3) Law and Practices, (4) Maximum\r\nSentence, (5) Prediction of Trial Outcome, (6) Conference Precedent,\r\n(7) Personal Background History, and (8) Recommendations.\r\nInformation in Part 5, the Case Information Data File, was drawn from\r\ncourt records and includes type of case, number of\r\ncharges, sentence type, sentence severity (stated and perceived),\r\nseriousness of offense, date of arrest, date of arraignment, date of\r\nconference, prior incarcerations, and defendant background.",

The\r\nstudy was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Law\r\nEnforcement and Criminal Justice of the Law Enforcement Assistance\r\nAdministration, United States Department of Justice. Parts 1-3,\r\nDefendants, Victims, and Police files, consist of responses to questionnaires\r\ngiven to defendants, victims, and police. The questionnaires were\r\nadministered during 20-minute interviews, conducted after the case had\r\nbeen completed. The interview instruments were designed to collect\r\ndata on three major issues: (1) the extent to which respondents\r\nreported participation in the processing of their cases, (2)\r\nrespondents' knowledge of the way their cases were processed, and (3)\r\nrespondents' attitudes toward the disposition of their cases and\r\ntoward the criminal justice system. Part 4 is the Conference Data\r\nFile. During the pretrial settlement conference, an observer wrote down\r\nin sequence as much as possible of the verbal behavior. After the\r\nsession, the observer made some subjective ratings, provided\r\ndescriptive data about the conclusion of the session, and classified\r\ncomments into one of the following categories: (1) Facts of\r\nthe Case, (2) Prior Record, (3) Law and Practices, (4) Maximum\r\nSentence, (5) Prediction of Trial Outcome, (6) Conference Precedent,\r\n(7) Personal Background History, and (8) Recommendations.\r\nInformation in Part 5, the Case Information Data File, was drawn from\r\ncourt records and includes type of case, number of\r\ncharges, sentence type, sentence severity (stated and perceived),\r\nseriousness of offense, date of arrest, date of arraignment, date of\r\nconference, prior incarcerations, and defendant background.",

It was one of a\r\nseries of data-gathering efforts undertaken during the 1970s to assist\r\npolicymakers in assessing and overcoming deficiencies in the nation's\r\ncorrectional institutions. This particular survey was conducted in\r\nresponse to a mandate set forth in the Crime Control Act of 1976. Data\r\nwere gathered via self-enumerated questionnaires that were mailed to\r\nthe administrators of all 558 federal and state prisons and all 405\r\ncommunity-based prerelease facilities in existence in the United\r\nStates in 1979.

Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such\r\n was the Conflict Tactics Scale for Parent and Child (CTSS). The CTSS,\r\n administered to the primary caregiver (PC) of subjects belonging to\r\n Cohorts 0, 3, 6, and 9, measured psychological and physical\r\n maltreatment and neglect of children by their PC or any other adult\r\n family or household member, as well as nonviolent modes of\r\n discipline. The CTSS also measured the extent to which an adult\r\n carried out specific acts of physical and psychological aggression,\r\n regardless of whether the child was injured. This Wave 3 study was\r\n modified from the Wave 1 parent-child version of the Conflict Tactics\r\n Scale used in PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS\r\n (PHDCN): CONFLICT TACTICS SCALE FOR PARENT AND CHILD, WAVE 1,\r\n 1994-1997 (ICPSR 13584).

There were six objectives: (1) To determine the extent of Limited English Proficient (LEP) women seeking protection orders on a national scale with documentation of languages represented and geographic distribution; (2) To assess current policies and procedures regarding LEP requests for protection orders; (3) To estimate the courts' current level of language services and assistance to LEP women seeking protection orders; (4) To identify and assess court collaborations with local community-based organizations; (5) To examine budget, staffing, and coordination issues that facilitate delivery of services to LEP clients; and (6) To develop national service and delivery models based on promising local practices.\r\nThe multi-method study design included a national survey of courts, an intensive survey of a select group of courts and community-based organizations within their jurisdictions, and the assessment of selected sites that can serve as national models. The national survey, based on a systematic sample of counties stratified by population and state resulted in a nationally representative sample of courts. The overwhelming majority of courts were general jurisdiction courts that handled a variety of criminal, civil, and/or family matters. The national survey was followed by an intensive survey of a subset of courts, and local community-based organizations (CBOs) that served domestic violence victims. Courts selected for this phase had promising practices, such as language assistance plans in civil cases and the use of certified interpreters. The intensive survey included telephone interviews of court and CBO representatives and a fax survey for CBOs. Finally, three case studies were conducted to develop promising practices.  The Part 1 (Phase I Data) data file contains 158 cases and 203 variables.  The Part 2 (Phase II Quantitative Data) data file contains 81 cases and 81 variables.  Part 3 (Phase II Qualitative Data) contains 123 interviews.",

There were six objectives: (1) To determine the extent of Limited English Proficient (LEP) women seeking protection orders on a national scale with documentation of languages represented and geographic distribution; (2) To assess current policies and procedures regarding LEP requests for protection orders; (3) To estimate the courts' current level of language services and assistance to LEP women seeking protection orders; (4) To identify and assess court collaborations with local community-based organizations; (5) To examine budget, staffing, and coordination issues that facilitate delivery of services to LEP clients; and (6) To develop national service and delivery models based on promising local practices.\r\nThe multi-method study design included a national survey of courts, an intensive survey of a select group of courts and community-based organizations within their jurisdictions, and the assessment of selected sites that can serve as national models. The national survey, based on a systematic sample of counties stratified by population and state resulted in a nationally representative sample of courts. The overwhelming majority of courts were general jurisdiction courts that handled a variety of criminal, civil, and/or family matters. The national survey was followed by an intensive survey of a subset of courts, and local community-based organizations (CBOs) that served domestic violence victims. Courts selected for this phase had promising practices, such as language assistance plans in civil cases and the use of certified interpreters. The intensive survey included telephone interviews of court and CBO representatives and a fax survey for CBOs. Finally, three case studies were conducted to develop promising practices.  The Part 1 (Phase I Data) data file contains 158 cases and 203 variables.  The Part 2 (Phase II Quantitative Data) data file contains 81 cases and 81 variables.  Part 3 (Phase II Qualitative Data) contains 123 interviews.",

Drawing on the social disorganization and concentrated disadvantage literature, this study used growth-curve modeling and semi-parametric group-based trajectory modeling to: (1) assess neighborhood variation in homicide trends; (2) identify the particular types of homicide trajectory that Chicago neighborhoods follow; (3) assess whether structural characteristics of neighborhoods influence homicide trends and trajectories; and (4) determine the extent to which the influence of structural characteristics is mediated by neighborhood levels of collective efficacy. This project extended prior research by not only describing the homicide trends and trajectories of Chicago neighborhoods, but also identifying the neighborhood characteristics that directly and indirectly influence those trends.",

Drawing on the social disorganization and concentrated disadvantage literature, this study used growth-curve modeling and semi-parametric group-based trajectory modeling to: (1) assess neighborhood variation in homicide trends; (2) identify the particular types of homicide trajectory that Chicago neighborhoods follow; (3) assess whether structural characteristics of neighborhoods influence homicide trends and trajectories; and (4) determine the extent to which the influence of structural characteristics is mediated by neighborhood levels of collective efficacy. This project extended prior research by not only describing the homicide trends and trajectories of Chicago neighborhoods, but also identifying the neighborhood characteristics that directly and indirectly influence those trends.",

The project sought to identify and connect local\r\n attorneys' needs for information with the best knowledge available on\r\n the most effective prosecution methods. In order to appraise domestic\r\n violence prosecution in the United States, the researchers mailed a\r\n survey to a nationally-representative sample of prosecutors to assess\r\n prosecution strategies in domestic violence cases (Part 1,\r\n Prosecutors' Survey Data). Smaller jurisdictions had such a low\r\n response rate to the initial survey that a modified follow-up survey\r\n (Part 2, Prosecutors' Follow-Up Data) was administered to those\r\n jurisdictions. From these surveys, the researchers identified three\r\n sites with pioneering specialized domestic violence prosecution\r\n programs: Duluth, Minnesota, King County, Washington, and San\r\n Francisco, California. In these three sites, the researchers then\r\n conducted a case file analysis of a random sample of domestic violence\r\n cases (Part 3, Case File Data). A survey of a random sample of female\r\n victims was also undertaken in King County and San Francisco (Part 4,\r\n Victim Interview Data). In addition, the researchers conducted on-site\r\n evaluations of these three specialized programs in which they\r\n interviewed staff about the scope of the domestic violence problem,\r\n domestic violence support personnel, the impact of the program on the\r\n domestic violence problem, and recommendations for the future. The\r\n qualitative data collected from these evaluations are provided only in\r\n the codebook for this collection. Parts 1 and 2, the Prosecutors'\r\n Surveys, contain variables about case management, case screening and\r\n charging, pretrial release policies, post-charge diversion, trial,\r\n sentencing options, victim support programs, and office and\r\n jurisdiction demographics. Questions cover the volume of domestic\r\n violence prosecutions, formal protocols for domestic violence\r\n prosecution, ways to deal with uncooperative victims, pro-arrest and\r\n no-drop policies, protection orders, types of evidence used, and\r\n collaboration with other organizations to prosecute domestic violence\r\n cases. In addition, Part 1 includes variables on diversion programs,\r\n victim noncompliance, substance abuse problems, victim support\r\n programs, and plea negotiations. Variables in Part 3, Case File Data,\r\n deal with reporting, initial and final charges, injuries sustained,\r\n weapons used, evidence available, protection orders issued, victim\r\n cooperation, police testimony, disposition, sentence, costs, and\r\n restitution for each domestic violence case. Part 4, Victim Interview\r\n Data, includes variables concerning victims' employment history,\r\n number of children, and substance abuse, opinions about the charges\r\n against the defendant, decision-making in the case, and prosecution\r\n strategies, and victims' participation in the case, amount of support\r\n from and contact with criminal justice agencies, safety concerns, and\r\n performance evaluations of various levels of the criminal justice\r\nsystem.",

-            "description": "This study was designed to explore whether civil protection\r\n orders were effective in providing safer environments for victims of\r\n domestic violence and enhancing their opportunities for escaping\r\n violent relationships. The researchers looked at the factors that\r\n might influence civil protection orders, such as accessibility to the\r\n court process, linkages to public and private services and sources of\r\n support, and the criminal record of the victim's abuser, and then\r\n examined how courts in three jurisdictions processed civil protection\r\n orders. Wilmington, Delaware, Denver, Colorado, and the District of\r\n Columbia were chosen as sites because of structural differences among\r\n them that were believed to be linked to the effectiveness of civil\r\n protection orders. Since these jurisdictions each had different court\r\n processes and service models, the researchers expected that these\r\n models would produce various results and that these variations might\r\n hold implications for improving practices in other jurisdictions.

The researchers looked at the factors that\r\n might influence civil protection orders, such as accessibility to the\r\n court process, linkages to public and private services and sources of\r\n support, and the criminal record of the victim's abuser, and then\r\n examined how courts in three jurisdictions processed civil protection\r\n orders. Wilmington, Delaware, Denver, Colorado, and the District of\r\n Columbia were chosen as sites because of structural differences among\r\n them that were believed to be linked to the effectiveness of civil\r\n protection orders. Since these jurisdictions each had different court\r\n processes and service models, the researchers expected that these\r\n models would produce various results and that these variations might\r\n hold implications for improving practices in other jurisdictions. Data\r\n were collected through initial and follow-up interviews with women who\r\n had filed civil protection orders. The effectiveness of the civil\r\n protection orders was measured by the amount of improvement in the\r\n quality of the women's lives after the order was in place, versus the\r\n extent of problems created by the protection orders.

Community policing, for this study, was defined as any law\r\n enforcement strategy designed to improve policy directed toward law\r\n enforcement interaction with community groups and citizens. Data were\r\n gathered from surveys that were distributed to two groups. First, to\r\n determine community perceptions of crime and attitudes toward the\r\n development of collaborative community policing strategies, surveys\r\n were distributed to the residents of the villages of Alfred and\r\n Wellsville and the town of Alfred in Allegany County, New York (Part\r\n 1, Community Survey Data). Second, to capture the ideas and\r\n perceptions of different types of law enforcement agencies regarding\r\n their willingness to share training, communication, and technology,\r\n surveys were distributed to the law enforcement agencies of\r\n Wellsville, Alfred, the New York State Police substation (located in\r\n the town of Wellsville), the county sheriff's department, and the\r\n Alfred State College and Alfred University public safety departments\r\n (Part 2, Law Enforcement Survey Data). For Part 1 (Community Survey\r\n Data), the residents were asked to rate their level of fear of crime,\r\n the reason for most crime problems (i.e., gangs, drugs, or\r\n unsupervised children), positive and negative contact with police, the\r\n presence and overall level of police service in the neighborhoods, and\r\n the importance of motor vehicle patrols, foot patrols, crime\r\n prevention programs, and traffic enforcement. Respondents were also\r\n asked whether they agreed that police should concentrate more on\r\n catching criminals (as opposed to implementing community-based\r\n programs), and if community policing was a good idea. Demographic data\r\n on residents includes their age, sex, whether they had been the victim\r\n of a property or personal crime, and the number of years they had\r\n lived in their respective communities. Demographic information for\r\n Part 2 (Law Enforcement Survey Data) includes the sex, age, and\r\n educational level of law enforcement respondents, as well as the\r\n number of years they had worked with their respective\r\n departments. Respondents were asked if they believed in and would\r\n support programs targeted toward youth, adults, the elderly, and\r\n merchants. Further queries focused on the number of regular and\r\n overtime hours used to train, develop, and implement department\r\n programs. A series of questions dealing with degrees of trust between\r\n the departments and levels of optimism was also asked to gauge\r\n attitudes that might discourage collaboration efforts with other\r\n departments on community-oriented programs. Officers were also asked\r\nto rate their willingness to work with the other agencies.",

Information was collected on the basics of each\r\n accreditation standard, its references to issues of community-oriented\r\n policing (COP) and problem-oriented policing (POP), and general\r\n information on its compatibility, or conflict with COP and POP. Basic\r\n variables cover standard, chapter, section, and\r\n applicability. Variables focusing on the compatibility of\r\n community-oriented policing and the accreditation standards include\r\n sources of legitimacy/authorization, community input, community\r\n reciprocity, geographic responsibility, and broadening of\r\n functions. Variables on problem-oriented policing include level of\r\n analysis, empirical analysis, collaboration with nonpolice agencies,\r\n evaluation/assessment, and nature of the problem. Variables on\r\n management and administration concern officer discretion,\r\n specialization by unit, specialization by task, formalization,\r\n centralization, levels/hierarchy, employee notification, employee\r\n involvement, employee rights, specific accountability, and customer\r\n orientation. General information on the compatibility or conflict\r\n between a standard and community-oriented policing/problem-oriented\r\n policing includes overall restrictiveness of the standard, primary\r\nstrategic affiliation, focus on process, and focus on administration.",

-            "description": "To further the understanding of violence against women, the\r\n National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the National Center for Injury\r\n Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Centers for Disease Control and\r\n Prevention (CDC), jointly sponsored the National Violence Against\r\n Women (NVAW) Survey. To provide a context in which to place women's\r\n experiences, the NVAW Survey sampled both women and men. Completed\r\n interviews were obtained from 8,000 women and 8,005 men who were 18\r\n years of age or older residing in households throughout the United\r\n States. The female version of the survey was fielded from November\r\n 1995 to May 1996. The male version of the survey was fielded during\r\n February to May 1996. Spanish versions of both the male and female\r\n surveys were fielded from April to May 1996. Respondents to the NVAW\r\n Survey were queried about (1) their general fear of violence and the\r\n ways in which they managed their fears, (2) emotional abuse they had\r\n experienced by marital and cohabitating partners, (3) physical assault\r\n they had experienced as children by adult caretakers, (4) physical\r\n assault they had experienced as adults by any type of perpetrator, (5)\r\n forcible rape or stalking they had experienced by any type of\r\n perpetrator, and (6) incidents of threatened violence they had\r\n experienced by any type of perpetrator. Respondents disclosing\r\n victimization were asked detailed questions about the characteristics\r\n and consequences of victimization as they experienced it, including\r\n injuries sustained and use of medical services. Incidents were\r\n recorded that had occurred at any time during the respondent's\r\n lifetime and also those that occurred within the 12 months prior to\r\n the interview. Data were gathered on both male-to-female and\r\n female-to-male intimate partner victimization as well as abuse by\r\n same-sex partners. Due to the sensitive nature of the survey, female\r\n respondents were interviewed by female interviewers. In order to test\r\n for possible bias caused by the gender of the interviewers when\r\n speaking to men, a split sample was used so that half of the male\r\n respondents had female interviewers and the other half had male\r\n interviewers. The questionnaires contained 14 sections, each covering\r\n a different topic, as follows.

To provide a context in which to place women's\r\n experiences, the NVAW Survey sampled both women and men. Completed\r\n interviews were obtained from 8,000 women and 8,005 men who were 18\r\n years of age or older residing in households throughout the United\r\n States. The female version of the survey was fielded from November\r\n 1995 to May 1996. The male version of the survey was fielded during\r\n February to May 1996. Spanish versions of both the male and female\r\n surveys were fielded from April to May 1996. Respondents to the NVAW\r\n Survey were queried about (1) their general fear of violence and the\r\n ways in which they managed their fears, (2) emotional abuse they had\r\n experienced by marital and cohabitating partners, (3) physical assault\r\n they had experienced as children by adult caretakers, (4) physical\r\n assault they had experienced as adults by any type of perpetrator, (5)\r\n forcible rape or stalking they had experienced by any type of\r\n perpetrator, and (6) incidents of threatened violence they had\r\n experienced by any type of perpetrator. Respondents disclosing\r\n victimization were asked detailed questions about the characteristics\r\n and consequences of victimization as they experienced it, including\r\n injuries sustained and use of medical services. Incidents were\r\n recorded that had occurred at any time during the respondent's\r\n lifetime and also those that occurred within the 12 months prior to\r\n the interview. Data were gathered on both male-to-female and\r\n female-to-male intimate partner victimization as well as abuse by\r\n same-sex partners. Due to the sensitive nature of the survey, female\r\n respondents were interviewed by female interviewers. In order to test\r\n for possible bias caused by the gender of the interviewers when\r\n speaking to men, a split sample was used so that half of the male\r\n respondents had female interviewers and the other half had male\r\n interviewers. The questionnaires contained 14 sections, each covering\r\n a different topic, as follows. Section A: Respondents' fears of\r\n different types of violence, and behaviors they had adopted to\r\n accommodate those fears. Section B: Respondent demographics and\r\n household characteristics. Section C: The number of current and past\r\n marital and opposite-sex and same-sex cohabitating relationships of the\r\n respondent. Section D: Characteristics of the respondent's current\r\n relationship and the demographics and other characteristics of their\r\n spouse and/or partner. Section E: Power, control, and emotional abuse\r\n by each spouse or partner. Sections F through I: Screening for\r\n incidents of rape, physical assault, stalking, and threat\r\n victimization, respectively. Sections J through M: Detailed\r\n information on each incident of rape, physical assault, stalking, and\r\n threat victimization, respectively, reported by the respondent for\r\n each type of perpetrator identified in the victimization screening\r\n section. Section N: Violence in the respondent's current\r\n relationship, including steps taken because of violence in the\r\n relationship and whether the violent behavior had stopped. The section\r\n concluded with items to assess if the respondent had symptoms\r\n associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The primary\r\n objectives of the study were (1) to identify the scope of gang\r\n migration nationally, (2) to describe the nature of gang migration,\r\n (3) to assess the impact of gang migration on destination cities, and\r\n (4) to describe the current law enforcement responses to the migration\r\n of gangs and identify those that appeared to be most effective for\r\n various types of migration. Two phases of data collection were\r\n used. The major objective of the initial phase was to identify cities\r\n that had experienced gang migration (Part 1). This was accomplished by\r\n distributing a brief mail questionnaire in 1992 to law enforcement\r\n agencies in cities identified as potential gang or gang migration\r\n sites. The second major phase of data collection involved in-depth\r\n telephone interviews with law enforcement officers in cities that had\r\n experienced gang migration in order to develop descriptions of the\r\n nature of migration and police responses to it (Part 2). For Part 1,\r\n information was collected on the year migration started, number of\r\n migrants in the past year, factors that deter gang migration, number\r\n of gang members, names of gangs, ethnic distribution of gang members\r\n and their drug market involvement, number of gang homicides, number of\r\n 1991 gang \"drive-bys\", and if gangs or narcotics were specified in the\r\n respondent's assignment. For Part 2, information was collected on the\r\n demographics of gang members, the ethnic percentage of drug gang\r\n members and their involvement in distributing specific drugs, and the\r\n influence of gang migrants on local gang and crime situations in terms\r\n of types and methods of crime, drug distribution activities,\r\n technology/equipment used, and targets of crime. Information on\r\n patterns of gang migration, including motivations to migrate, drug gang\r\n migration, and volume of migration, was also collected. Local responses\r\n to gang migration covered information sources, department policies\r\n relative to migration, gang specialization in department, approaches\r\n taken by the department, and information exchanges and coordination\r\namong local, state, and federal agencies.",

The research project sought to obtain information from a\r\nbroad sample of high-school-aged youth to achieve diversity regarding\r\nhistory, cultural background, population size and density, urban and\r\nnon-urban mix, economic situation, and class, race, and ethnic\r\ndistributions. Data for the study were derived from two surveys\r\nconducted during the spring of 1996. The first survey was a lengthy\r\nquestionnaire that focused on exposure to weapons (primarily firearms\r\nand knives) and violence, and was completed by 733 10th- and\r\n11th-grade male students. Detail was gathered on all weapon-related\r\nincidents up to 12 months prior to the survey. The second survey,\r\nconsisting of a questionnaire completed by 48 administrators of the\r\n53 schools that the students attended, provided information regarding\r\nschool characteristics, levels of weapon-related activity in the\r\nschools, and anti-violence strategies employed by the schools. The\r\nstudent survey covered demographic characteristics of the respondent,\r\nfamily living situations, educational situations and aspirations,\r\ndrug, criminal, and gang activities, crime- and violence-related\r\ncharacteristics of family and friends, respondent's social and\r\nrecreational activities, exposure to violence generally, personal\r\nvictimization history, and possession of and activities relating to\r\nfirearms and knives. Administrators were asked to provide basic\r\ndemographic data about their schools and to rate the seriousness of\r\nviolence, drugs, guns, and other weapons in their institutions. They\r\nwere asked to provide weapon-related information about the average\r\nmale junior in their schools as well as to estimate the number of\r\nincidents involving types of weapons on school grounds during the past\r\nthree years. The administrators were also asked to identify, from an\r\nextensive list of violence reduction measures, those that were\r\npracticed at their schools. Variables are also provided about the type\r\nof school, grades taught, enrollment, and size of the community. In\r\naddition to the data collected directly from students and school\r\nadministrators, Census information concerning the cities and towns in\r\nwhich the sampled schools were located was also obtained. Census data\r\ninclude size of the city or town, racial and ethnic population\r\ndistributions, age, gender, and educational attainment distributions,\r\nmedian household and per capita income distributions, poverty rates,\r\nlabor force and unemployment rates, and violent and property crime\r\nrates.",

The study\r\n examined the use of several jury reform techniques using a controlled\r\n mock jury approach in which mock juries composed of jury pool members\r\n watched a videotaped armed robbery trial featuring conflicting expert\r\n testimony about mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evidence. A total of 480\r\n mock jurors were randomly assigned to eight-person juries and to one\r\n of the six conditions in the experiment. Ten mock juries were run in\r\n each of the six conditions (No Innovations, Note Taking, Question\r\n Asking and Note Taking, DNA Checklist and Note Taking, Jury Notebook\r\n and Note Taking, and All Innovations). At various points throughout\r\n the study (before the trial, after watching the videotaped trial, and\r\n after reaching a verdict), mock jurors were asked to complete\r\n questionnaires to gauge their understanding of mtDNA and the mtDNA\r\n evidence presented during the trial. They were also asked if and how\r\n the use of the jury trial innovations helped in their understanding of\r\n the mtDNA evidence. Specific variables contained in the study include\r\n demographic variables of the mock jurors, including their math and\r\n science background, mock jurors' views of science, their understanding\r\n of mtDNA, their perceptions of the reliability of different types of\r\n evidence, and the credibility of the prosecutor, defense attorney,\r\n detective, eyewitness, defendant, and expert witnesses, and whether\r\nthe mock jurors favor or oppose the various innovations.",

The study\r\n examined the use of several jury reform techniques using a controlled\r\n mock jury approach in which mock juries composed of jury pool members\r\n watched a videotaped armed robbery trial featuring conflicting expert\r\n testimony about mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evidence. A total of 480\r\n mock jurors were randomly assigned to eight-person juries and to one\r\n of the six conditions in the experiment. Ten mock juries were run in\r\n each of the six conditions (No Innovations, Note Taking, Question\r\n Asking and Note Taking, DNA Checklist and Note Taking, Jury Notebook\r\n and Note Taking, and All Innovations). At various points throughout\r\n the study (before the trial, after watching the videotaped trial, and\r\n after reaching a verdict), mock jurors were asked to complete\r\n questionnaires to gauge their understanding of mtDNA and the mtDNA\r\n evidence presented during the trial. They were also asked if and how\r\n the use of the jury trial innovations helped in their understanding of\r\n the mtDNA evidence. Specific variables contained in the study include\r\n demographic variables of the mock jurors, including their math and\r\n science background, mock jurors' views of science, their understanding\r\n of mtDNA, their perceptions of the reliability of different types of\r\n evidence, and the credibility of the prosecutor, defense attorney,\r\n detective, eyewitness, defendant, and expert witnesses, and whether\r\nthe mock jurors favor or oppose the various innovations.",

Instead of focusing on women as\r\npotential victims and men as potential perpetrators, the program was\r\ndifferent from other prevention programs in that it approached both\r\nwomen and men as potential bystanders or witnesses to behaviors\r\nrelated to sexual violence. Three hundred and eighty-nine\r\nundergraduate students were recruited to participant in the study in\r\nthe spring (first wave) and fall (second wave) semesters of 2003 at a\r\nnortheastern state university in the United States. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control\r\ngroup. All first-wave participants filled out pretest questionnaires\r\n(Part 1), post-test questionnaires (Part 2), and questionnaires two\r\n(Part 3) and twelve (Part 4) months following the first post test.\r\nThose in the first wave experimental conditions participated in the\r\none-session or three-session training program prior to filling out the\r\npost-test questionnaire, and they participated in a booster session\r\nbefore filling out the questionnaire at the two-month mark.\r\nSecond-wave participants experienced similar treatments through the\r\ntwo-month follow-up questionnaire. After that, they received a\r\nfour-month follow-up questionnaire (Part 5) at the same time that the\r\nfirst-wave participants did their twelve-month follow-up\r\nquestionnaire. Numerous demographic variables are included in the\r\nstudy, along with variables from 15 different scales, a knowledge\r\nquestionnaire, responses to vignettes, and respondents' own\r\nexperiences with sexual violence.",

Instead of focusing on women as\r\npotential victims and men as potential perpetrators, the program was\r\ndifferent from other prevention programs in that it approached both\r\nwomen and men as potential bystanders or witnesses to behaviors\r\nrelated to sexual violence. Three hundred and eighty-nine\r\nundergraduate students were recruited to participant in the study in\r\nthe spring (first wave) and fall (second wave) semesters of 2003 at a\r\nnortheastern state university in the United States. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control\r\ngroup. All first-wave participants filled out pretest questionnaires\r\n(Part 1), post-test questionnaires (Part 2), and questionnaires two\r\n(Part 3) and twelve (Part 4) months following the first post test.\r\nThose in the first wave experimental conditions participated in the\r\none-session or three-session training program prior to filling out the\r\npost-test questionnaire, and they participated in a booster session\r\nbefore filling out the questionnaire at the two-month mark.\r\nSecond-wave participants experienced similar treatments through the\r\ntwo-month follow-up questionnaire. After that, they received a\r\nfour-month follow-up questionnaire (Part 5) at the same time that the\r\nfirst-wave participants did their twelve-month follow-up\r\nquestionnaire. Numerous demographic variables are included in the\r\nstudy, along with variables from 15 different scales, a knowledge\r\nquestionnaire, responses to vignettes, and respondents' own\r\nexperiences with sexual violence.",

The\r\nprogram was set up as an early intervention program to provide\r\ndomestic violence (DV) education for arrestees during their time of\r\ndetention before going to court. This evaluation used an experimental\r\ndesign. The researchers randomly assigned 629 batterers to either the\r\nbatterer treatment wing of the jail or to a no-treatment control group\r\nin another wing of the jail. Interviews were conducted with the\r\nbatterers and victims shortly after the arrest that placed the\r\nbatterer in the Sacramento jail (Parts 1 and 2) and again six months\r\nafter the intervention or control condition was concluded (Parts 3 and\r\n4). Official police arrest data on recidivism were also collected\r\npost-arrest (Part 5). Interviews were conducted over the phone, except\r\nfor the baseline batterer interviews that were done in the jail, and\r\nfor those who were not available for interviewing, over the phone.\r\nActivities of the batterer treatment program included: mandatory\r\ndetention in a special DV jail wing supervised by correction officers\r\nwho had received special DV training, batterer educational workshops,\r\ndaily Twelve-Step Drug/Alcohol addiction support groups, and strict\r\nregulations on television watching (special nonviolent educational\r\nprograms were the only available programs). Batterer education classes\r\nwere held daily, and the research team checked attendance logs. The\r\narrestees were required at least to attend the program classes and\r\nNarcotics Anonymous/Alcoholics Anonymous groups and sit quietly. For\r\nthe control group, participants were assigned to the regular part of\r\nthe jail and received the usual incarceration experience of persons\r\ndetained in the Sacramento County Jail (including no treatment\r\nservices). Official police arrest data on recidivism were analyzed for\r\nup to one year post-arrest (Part 5). Treatment implementation data\r\n(Part 6), which records the frequency of the batterer's attendance in\r\nthe various treatment programs offered in the special DV jail wing,\r\nand variables used in the analysis for the project's final report\r\n(Part 7) are also available with this collection. In addition to\r\ngeneral demographic variables such as age, race, religion, source of\r\nincome, and employment situation, specific variables are gathered for\r\nspecific datasets. Variables collected in Parts 1 and 2 (Batterer and\r\nVictim Baseline Data) include information regarding whether or not the\r\nbatterer was in the treatment or control group, the relationship\r\nbetween the batterer and victim, and types of injuries the victim\r\nreceived. Parts 3 and 4 (Batterer and Victim Six-Month Data) contain\r\nvariables related to employment and living situation, as well as any\r\nadditional assistance either party received since the arrest\r\nevent. Variables in Part 5 (Tracking Database) include the date,\r\nlocation, and length of interviews. Part 6 (Treatment and\r\nImplementation Data) contains variables related to the different\r\nprograms the batterer in the experimental group may have participated\r\nin.

Two projects funded\r\n by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) evaluated these Milwaukee\r\n domestic violence experiments. The first project examined the\r\n effectiveness of a specialized domestic violence court that opened in\r\n September 1994. The primary intent of the specialized domestic\r\n violence court was to speed up the disposition of cases. The second\r\n project examined the impact of a change in the district attorney's\r\n (DA's) screening policy that admitted more cases into the special\r\n court, which became effective January 1, 1995. The liberalized\r\n prosecutorial policy was intended to determine whether arrests that\r\n the DA normally rejected for prosecution because victims failed to\r\n attend the prosecutor's charging conference could be prosecuted\r\n successfully none the less. The researchers collected data from three\r\n time periods: (1) prior to September 1994, (2) between September 1994\r\n and January 1995, and (3) post-Janurary 1995. For the first\r\n experiment, several samples were selected from court and DA records to\r\n assess the impact of the introduction of the special domestic violence\r\n court and its impact after the change in the DA's charging policy.\r\n These samples of domestic violence cases (court samples) filed by the\r\n prosecutor included: (1) 237 cases from Summer 1994, (2) 190 cases\r\n from Fall 1994, and (3) 242 cases from Spring 1995. For the second\r\n experiment, three additional samples (complaint room samples) were\r\n collected of domestic cases declined by the prosecutor to determine\r\n how victim attendance at the charging conference and other factors\r\n affected the decision to prosecute: (1) 152 cases from Summer 1994,\r\n (2) 155 cases from Fall 1994, and (3) 152 cases from Spring 1995.\r\n Variables in this dataset include if the case was filed, type of\r\n charges, number of prior misdemeanors, number of prior felonies,\r\n number of misdemeanors after, number of felonies after, number of\r\n felony convictions, number of misdemeanor convictions, number of\r\n subpoenas, number of judicial body attachment orders, whether the\r\n victim was cooperative, if the victim testified, method of\r\n disposition, type of disposition, time to disposition, time to\r\n sentencing, sentencing conditions, if the defendant received jail or\r\n prison time, if the defendant received probation time, number of\r\n months incarcerated, number of months on probation, and several date\r\n variables. Additional variables provide the sex of the defendant, the\r\n relationship between the defendant and the victim, if the victim was\r\ninjured, if the victim was intoxicated, and use of a weapon.",

For the first\r\n experiment, several samples were selected from court and DA records to\r\n assess the impact of the introduction of the special domestic violence\r\n court and its impact after the change in the DA's charging policy.\r\n These samples of domestic violence cases (court samples) filed by the\r\n prosecutor included: (1) 237 cases from Summer 1994, (2) 190 cases\r\n from Fall 1994, and (3) 242 cases from Spring 1995. For the second\r\n experiment, three additional samples (complaint room samples) were\r\n collected of domestic cases declined by the prosecutor to determine\r\n how victim attendance at the charging conference and other factors\r\n affected the decision to prosecute: (1) 152 cases from Summer 1994,\r\n (2) 155 cases from Fall 1994, and (3) 152 cases from Spring 1995.\r\n Variables in this dataset include if the case was filed, type of\r\n charges, number of prior misdemeanors, number of prior felonies,\r\n number of misdemeanors after, number of felonies after, number of\r\n felony convictions, number of misdemeanor convictions, number of\r\n subpoenas, number of judicial body attachment orders, whether the\r\n victim was cooperative, if the victim testified, method of\r\n disposition, type of disposition, time to disposition, time to\r\n sentencing, sentencing conditions, if the defendant received jail or\r\n prison time, if the defendant received probation time, number of\r\n months incarcerated, number of months on probation, and several date\r\n variables. Additional variables provide the sex of the defendant, the\r\n relationship between the defendant and the victim, if the victim was\r\ninjured, if the victim was intoxicated, and use of a weapon.",

Phase two of the\r\nproject consisted of state-level data collection for all 50 states for\r\nall study years, 1975 to 2002. The researchers produced a dataset\r\ncontaining outcome variables that focus on the change and growth in\r\nstate incarceration rates, non-policy control variables that were\r\nfound in previous studies to be associated with changes in\r\nincarceration rates, and policy variables regarding sentencing\r\nstructure, drug policy, time served requirements, habitual offender\r\nlaws (HOL), and mandatory sentences.",

The purpose of the study is\r\nto investigate differences in various dimensions of the concept of\r\nterritoriality (spatial identity, local ties, social cohesion,\r\ninformal social control) and physical characteristics (land use,\r\nhousing, street type, boundary characteristics) in three pairs of\r\nneighborhoods in Atlanta, Georgia. The study neighborhoods were\r\nselected by locating pairs of adjacent neighborhoods with distinctly\r\ndifferent crime levels. The criteria for selection, other than the\r\ndifference in crime rates and physical adjacency, were comparable\r\nracial composition and comparable economic status. This data\r\ncollection is divided into two files. Part 1, Atlanta Plan File,\r\ncontains information on every parcel of land within the six\r\nneighborhoods in the study. The variables include ownership, type of\r\nland use, physical characteristics, characteristics of structures, and\r\nassessed value of each parcel of land within the six\r\nneighborhoods. This file was used in the data analysis to measure a\r\nnumber of physical characteristics of parcels and blocks in the study\r\nneighborhoods, and as the sampling frame for the household survey. The\r\noriginal data were collected by the City of Atlanta Planning Bureau.\r\nPart 2, Atlanta Survey File, contains the results of a household\r\nsurvey administered to a stratified random sample of households within\r\neach of the study neighborhoods. Variables cover respondents'\r\nattitudes and behavior related to the neighborhood, fear of crime,\r\navoidance and protective measures, and victimization\r\nexperiences. Crime rates, land use, and housing characteristics of the\r\nblock in which the respondent resided were coded onto each case\r\nrecord.",

The purpose of the study is\r\nto investigate differences in various dimensions of the concept of\r\nterritoriality (spatial identity, local ties, social cohesion,\r\ninformal social control) and physical characteristics (land use,\r\nhousing, street type, boundary characteristics) in three pairs of\r\nneighborhoods in Atlanta, Georgia. The study neighborhoods were\r\nselected by locating pairs of adjacent neighborhoods with distinctly\r\ndifferent crime levels. The criteria for selection, other than the\r\ndifference in crime rates and physical adjacency, were comparable\r\nracial composition and comparable economic status. This data\r\ncollection is divided into two files. Part 1, Atlanta Plan File,\r\ncontains information on every parcel of land within the six\r\nneighborhoods in the study. The variables include ownership, type of\r\nland use, physical characteristics, characteristics of structures, and\r\nassessed value of each parcel of land within the six\r\nneighborhoods. This file was used in the data analysis to measure a\r\nnumber of physical characteristics of parcels and blocks in the study\r\nneighborhoods, and as the sampling frame for the household survey. The\r\noriginal data were collected by the City of Atlanta Planning Bureau.\r\nPart 2, Atlanta Survey File, contains the results of a household\r\nsurvey administered to a stratified random sample of households within\r\neach of the study neighborhoods. Variables cover respondents'\r\nattitudes and behavior related to the neighborhood, fear of crime,\r\navoidance and protective measures, and victimization\r\nexperiences. Crime rates, land use, and housing characteristics of the\r\nblock in which the respondent resided were coded onto each case\r\nrecord.",

In\r\nthe first phase offenders spent 90 to 180 days in a medium security\r\nprison participating in a rigorous boot camp-type program. Offenders\r\nwho successfully completed the program were released from prison and\r\nplaced under intensive supervision in the community--the second phase\r\nof the program. Changes in offender behavior and attitudes during the\r\nprison and community supervision phases of the shock program were\r\nexamined in a quasi-experimental design to determine the impact of the\r\nprogram on the individual offenders. Comparisons were made with\r\nsimilar offenders who were not in the shock program who had been\r\nsentenced to prison and parole/probation. Shock and nonshock\r\nincarcerated offenders were asked to complete self-report\r\nquestionnaires.

This center mounted a long-term\r\nresearch project that sought to explain the wide variation in crime\r\nstatistics by race and ethnicity. Using information from eight ethnic\r\ncommunities in Oakland, California, representing working- and\r\nmiddle-class Black, White, Chinese, and Hispanic groups, as well as\r\nadditional data from Oakland's justice systems and local\r\norganizations, the center conducted empirical research to describe the\r\ncriminalization process and to explore the relationship between race\r\nand crime. The differences in observed patterns and levels of crime\r\nwere analyzed in terms of: (1) the abilities of local ethnic\r\ncommunities to contribute to, resist, neutralize, or otherwise affect\r\nthe criminalization of its members, (2) the impacts of criminal\r\njustice policies on ethnic communities and their members, and (3) the\r\ncumulative impacts of criminal justice agency decisions on the\r\nprocessing of individuals in the system. Administrative records data\r\nwere gathered from two sources, the Alameda County Criminal Oriented\r\nRecords Production System (CORPUS) (Part 1) and the Oakland District\r\nAttorney Legal Information System (DALITE) (Part 2). In addition to\r\ncollecting administrative data, the researchers also surveyed\r\nresidents (Part 3), police officers (Part 4), and public defenders and\r\ndistrict attorneys (Part 5). The eight study areas included a middle-\r\nand low-income pair of census tracts for each of the four\r\nracial/ethnic groups: white, Black, Hispanic, and Asian. Part 1,\r\nCriminal Oriented Records Production System (CORPUS) Data, contains\r\ninformation on offenders' most serious felony and misdemeanor arrests,\r\ndispositions, offense codes, bail arrangements, fines, jail terms, and\r\npleas for both current and prior arrests in Alameda\r\nCounty. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, and marital\r\nstatus. Variables in Part 2, District Attorney Legal Information\r\nSystem (DALITE) Data, include current and prior charges, days from\r\noffense to charge, disposition, and arrest, plea agreement conditions,\r\nfinal results from both municipal court and superior court, sentence\r\noutcomes, date and outcome of arraignment, disposition, and sentence,\r\nnumber and type of enhancements, numbers of convictions, mistrials,\r\nacquittals, insanity pleas, and dismissals, and factors that\r\ndetermined the prison term. For Part 3, Oakland Community Crime Survey\r\nData, researchers interviewed 1,930 Oakland residents from eight\r\ncommunities. Information was gathered from community residents on the\r\nquality of schools, shopping, and transportation in their\r\nneighborhoods, the neighborhood's racial composition, neighborhood\r\nproblems, such as noise, abandoned buildings, and drugs, level of\r\ncrime in the neighborhood, chances of being victimized, how\r\nrespondents would describe certain types of criminals in terms of age,\r\nrace, education, and work history, community involvement, crime\r\nprevention measures, the performance of the police, judges, and\r\nattorneys, victimization experiences, and fear of certain types of\r\ncrimes. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, and family\r\nstatus. For Part 4, Oakland Police Department Survey Data, Oakland\r\nCounty police officers were asked about why they joined the police\r\nforce, how they perceived their role, aspects of a good and a bad\r\npolice officer, why they believed crime was down, and how they would\r\ndescribe certain beats in terms of drug availability, crime rates,\r\nsocioeconomic status, number of juveniles, potential for violence,\r\nresidential versus commercial, and degree of danger. Officers were\r\nalso asked about problems particular neighborhoods were experiencing,\r\nstrategies for reducing crime, difficulties in doing police work well,\r\nand work conditions. Demographic variables include age, sex, race,\r\nmarital status, level of education, and years on the force. In Part 5,\r\nPublic Defender/District Attorney Survey Data, public defenders and\r\ndistrict attorneys were queried regarding which offenses were\r\nincreasing most rapidly in Oakland, and they were asked to rank\r\ncertain offenses in terms of seriousness. Respondents were also asked\r\nabout the public's influence on criminal justice agencies and on the\r\nperformance of certain criminal justice agencies. Respondents were\r\npresented with a list of crimes and asked how typical these offenses\r\nwere and what factors influenced their decisions about such cases\r\n(e.g., intent, motive, evidence, behavior, prior history, injury or\r\nloss, substance abuse, emotional trauma). Other variables measured how\r\noften and under what circumstances the public defender and client and\r\nthe public defender and the district attorney agreed on the case,\r\ndefendant characteristics in terms of who should not be put on the\r\nstand, the effects of Proposition 8, public defender and district\r\nattorney plea guidelines, attorney discretion, and advantageous and\r\ndisadvantageous characteristics of a defendant.

-            "description": "These data were collected in Oakland, California, and\r\n Birmingham, Alabama, to examine the effectiveness of alternative drug\r\n enforcement strategies. A further objective was to compare the\r\n relative effectiveness of strategies drawn from professional- versus\r\n community-oriented models of policing. The professional model\r\n emphasizes police responsibility for crime control, whereas the\r\n community model stresses the importance of a police-citizen\r\n partnership in crime control. At each site, experimental treatments\r\n were applied to selected police beats. The Oakland Police Department\r\n implemented a high-visibility enforcement effort consisting of\r\n undercover buy-bust operations, aggressive patrols, and motor vehicle\r\n stops, while the Birmingham Police Department engaged in somewhat less\r\n visible buy-busts and sting operations. Both departments attempted a\r\n community-oriented approach involving door-to-door contacts with\r\n residents. In Oakland, four beats were studied: one beat used a\r\n special drug enforcement unit, another used a door-to-door community\r\n policing strategy, a third used a combination of these approaches, and\r\n the fourth beat served as a control group. In Birmingham, three beats\r\n were chosen: Drug enforcement was conducted by the narcotics unit in\r\n one beat, door-to-door policing, as in Oakland, was used in another\r\n beat, and a police substation was established in the third beat. To\r\n evaluate the effectiveness of these alternative strategies, data were\r\n collected from three sources. First, a panel survey was administered\r\n in two waves on a pre-test/post-test basis. The panel survey data\r\n addressed the ways in which citizens' perceptions of drug activity,\r\n crime problems, neighborhood safety, and police service were affected\r\n by the various policing strategies. Second, structured observations of\r\n police and citizen encounters were made in Oakland during the periods\r\n the treatments were in effect. Observers trained by the researchers\r\n recorded information regarding the roles and behaviors of police and\r\n citizens as well as police compliance with the experiment's\r\n procedures. And third, to assess the impact of the alternative\r\n strategies on crime rates, reported crime data were collected for time\r\n periods before and during the experimental treatment periods, both in\r\nthe targeted beats and city-wide.",

A further objective was to compare the\r\n relative effectiveness of strategies drawn from professional- versus\r\n community-oriented models of policing. The professional model\r\n emphasizes police responsibility for crime control, whereas the\r\n community model stresses the importance of a police-citizen\r\n partnership in crime control. At each site, experimental treatments\r\n were applied to selected police beats. The Oakland Police Department\r\n implemented a high-visibility enforcement effort consisting of\r\n undercover buy-bust operations, aggressive patrols, and motor vehicle\r\n stops, while the Birmingham Police Department engaged in somewhat less\r\n visible buy-busts and sting operations. Both departments attempted a\r\n community-oriented approach involving door-to-door contacts with\r\n residents. In Oakland, four beats were studied: one beat used a\r\n special drug enforcement unit, another used a door-to-door community\r\n policing strategy, a third used a combination of these approaches, and\r\n the fourth beat served as a control group. In Birmingham, three beats\r\n were chosen: Drug enforcement was conducted by the narcotics unit in\r\n one beat, door-to-door policing, as in Oakland, was used in another\r\n beat, and a police substation was established in the third beat. To\r\n evaluate the effectiveness of these alternative strategies, data were\r\n collected from three sources. First, a panel survey was administered\r\n in two waves on a pre-test/post-test basis. The panel survey data\r\n addressed the ways in which citizens' perceptions of drug activity,\r\n crime problems, neighborhood safety, and police service were affected\r\n by the various policing strategies. Second, structured observations of\r\n police and citizen encounters were made in Oakland during the periods\r\n the treatments were in effect. Observers trained by the researchers\r\n recorded information regarding the roles and behaviors of police and\r\n citizens as well as police compliance with the experiment's\r\n procedures. And third, to assess the impact of the alternative\r\n strategies on crime rates, reported crime data were collected for time\r\n periods before and during the experimental treatment periods, both in\r\nthe targeted beats and city-wide.",

Research protocol involved 35 patrol officers\r\nin four Milwaukee police districts screening domestic violence cases\r\nfor eligibility, then calling police headquarters to request a\r\nrandomly-assigned disposition. The three possible randomly assigned\r\ndispositions were (1) Code 1, which consisted of arrest and at least\r\none night in jail, unless the suspect posted bond, (2) Code 2, which\r\nconsisted of arrest and immediate release on recognizance from the\r\nbooking area at police headquarters, or as soon as possible, and (3)\r\nCode 3, which consisted of a standard Miranda-style script warning\r\nread by police to both suspect and victim.

(2) Did the ARS affect the \r\n job satisfaction or morale of officers and supervisors?

(5) Did detectives and prosecuting attorneys \r\n find the ARS a more reliable source than handwritten PIRs? Officers and \r\n supervisors in two divisions of the Los Angeles Police Department, \r\n Wilshire and Hollywood, participated as control and experimental \r\n groups. The control group continued using handwritten (\"existing\") \r\n PIRs while the experimental group used the automated PIRs (ARS). The \r\n General Information Questionnaire collected information on each \r\n officer's rank, assignment, watch, gender, age, years with the Los \r\n Angeles Police Department, education, job morale, job demands, \r\n self-esteem, computer anxiety, and relationship with supervisor and \r\n other officers. The Job Performance Rating Form gathered data on work \r\n efforts, depth of job knowledge, work quality, oral and written skills, \r\n and capacity to learn. The Time Study Sheets collected data on \r\n investigation time, writing and editing time, travel time, approval and \r\n correction time, review time, errors by type, and data input time for \r\n both the handwritten and automated forms. The Evaluation of the \r\n Existing Form and the Evaluation of the Automated Form both queried \r\n respondents on ease of use, system satisfaction, and productivity loss. \r\n The ARS Use Questionnaire asked about ease of use, typing skills, \r\n computer skills, comfort with the system, satisfaction with training, \r\n and preference for the system. The Hollywood Detective Division ARS Use \r\n Questionnaire surveyed detectives on the system's ease of use, task \r\n improvement, support for continued use, and preference for the system. \r\n The PIR Content Evaluation Form collected data on quality of officers' \r\n observations, organization and writing skills, physical evidence, \r\n statements of victims, witnesses, and suspects, and offense \r\n classification. The Caplan Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity subscales \r\nwere used in the design of the questionnaires.",

The Wave 3 Home and Life\r\nInterview instrument was a reduced version of the Wave 2 Home and Life\r\nInterview instrument (PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO\r\nNEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): HOME AND LIFE INTERVIEW, WAVE 2, 1997-2000\r\n[ICPSR 13630]) that does not include an emphasis on evaluating the\r\nrelationship between the subject and the subject's father or, in the\r\nfather's absence, a male father figure. It was administered to\r\nsubjects' primary caregivers for Cohorts 0, 3, 6, and 9.",

The study followed a cohort of female IPV victims with cases the police presented to the prosecutor, in the year 2000, in a single Midwestern United States county (Kalamazoo County, Michigan) for a four-year period (1999-2002) across multiple systems (police, prosecutor, criminal court, civil court, hospital Emergency Departments) to assess the victim's experience with participation in IPV prosecution and her associated future help seeking, health and safety. Since this study utilized retrospective administrative data, subsequent IPV was defined as a future documented IPV-related police incident or an Emergency Department visit for IPV or injury. The data abstraction and analysis of the administrative data was informed by focus groups with survivors, advocates, and medical and criminal justice service providers, along with in-depth qualitative analysis of a stratified random sample of individual IPV cases. The final analytic dataset created by the research team integrated two types of data: (1) in-depth data about the index assault case and characteristics of the couple involved, and (2) longitudinal data about prior and subsequent IPV events spanning multiple systems: police, prosecutor, emergency department, and family court protection orders.",

Participants, who were randomly selected to receive outreach or treatment-as-usual, were interviewed at three time points: after an incident of IPV was reported to the police (T1), 6 months after T1, and 12 months after T1. The study addressed three primary roles. First, investigators evaluated the effectiveness of a coordinated, community-based outreach program in improving criminal justice and victim safety and empowerment outcomes for IPV victims using a longitudinal, randomized control design. Second, victim and case characteristics that moderated outcomes were identified. Third, the influence of spatial characteristics on criminal justice outcomes was evaluated.",

Drs. Caleb Lloyd and Ralph Serin developed the NG model with funding from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the National Institute of Corrections developed the NG curriculum for parole officers to implement. The Bureau of Justice Assistance funded the implementation of NG in three study sites: Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Des Moines, Iowa.\r\nThis mixed-methods study focused on understanding how NG was implemented as it was piloted in the three sites, and assessed NG-trained parole officers' fidelity to the NG model. In order to better understand NG's implementation and the business as usual practices it was intended to replace, the study also included a second group of parole officers who were not trained in NG. The groups were not randomly assigned. Data collected for this study included interview data, parole officer questionnaires related to concepts of the NG curriculum, coaching logs providing measures of whether officers received coaching and its frequency, video recordings of parole supervision meetings, and parole caseload data.\r\nDemographic variables included as part of this collection are parole officers' age and sex, and site location. The data collection includes 3 SAS data files:\r\n\r\nParole officer-level data (archive_raf170831_po): Includes 31 cases and 26 variables.\r\nVideo-level data (archive_raf170831_video): Includes 241 cases and 15 variables.\r\nQuestionnaire-level data (archive_raf180719_tests): Includes 50 cases and 8 variables.\r\n",

The Bureau of Justice Assistance funded the implementation of NG in three study sites: Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Des Moines, Iowa.\r\nThis mixed-methods study focused on understanding how NG was implemented as it was piloted in the three sites, and assessed NG-trained parole officers' fidelity to the NG model. In order to better understand NG's implementation and the business as usual practices it was intended to replace, the study also included a second group of parole officers who were not trained in NG. The groups were not randomly assigned. Data collected for this study included interview data, parole officer questionnaires related to concepts of the NG curriculum, coaching logs providing measures of whether officers received coaching and its frequency, video recordings of parole supervision meetings, and parole caseload data.\r\nDemographic variables included as part of this collection are parole officers' age and sex, and site location. The data collection includes 3 SAS data files:\r\n\r\nParole officer-level data (archive_raf170831_po): Includes 31 cases and 26 variables.\r\nVideo-level data (archive_raf170831_video): Includes 241 cases and 15 variables.\r\nQuestionnaire-level data (archive_raf180719_tests): Includes 50 cases and 8 variables.\r\n",

However, people are often incarcerated long distances from their home communities in areas that are difficult to reach by public transport, creating significant barriers to in-person visitation. Departments of corrections are exploring the use of computer-based video visits as a means to address some of the visitation needs of those in custody in a cost-effective way while continuing to encourage in-person visits. To learn more about this practice, the study team conducted the following research activities:\r\nA survey of incarcerated people: The study team surveyed 211 people incarcerated in Washington State prisons about their use of video visits, their perceptions of the service, and their experiences of in-person visits more generally. This was a self-administered, pen-and-paper survey.\r\nAn impact evaluation of video visits: The study team analyzed individual-level administrative data from the Washington Department of Corrections (WADOC) and the private video visit vendor (JPay) to understand whether use of the service affected four outcomes: 1) the number of in-person visits people received, 2) the number of rule violations (of any severity) people committed in prison, 3) the number of general (ie. non-serious) rule violations they committed, and 4) the number of serious (as defined by WADOC) rule violations that were committed. The researchers used two analytic techniques: 1) a difference-in-difference test, using inverse probability of treatment weighting, and 2) Bayesian additive regression trees.\r\nAn analysis of in-person visit rates: The study team analyzed administrative data relating to all people who were incarcerated for the 12 month period ending November 2015 (n=11,524). The study team produced descriptive statistics and conducted negative binomial regressions to understand the rates of in-person visits and how these related to the characteristics of the incarcerated people.",

The study used a qualitative case study design with a purposeful sample of five districts recruited from a database of 459 districts who experienced a case of school employee sexual misconduct in 2014. The study was conducted between January 2016 and September 2017.\r\nData collected included: 1) various district documents, 2) 41 interviews with primary actors (school employees and county officials directly involved in responding to the incident), 3) 10 focus groups with 51 secondary actors (school employees who were not directly involved with the incident but who might have been indirectly affected by it), and 4) offender, victim and district characteristics. Documents reviewed included written policies and protocols, training materials and handbooks for staff and students, case documents, and other guiding documents as applicable. In interviews and focus groups, participants were asked to discuss their knowledge of district policies and procedures, to describe the dissemination of and any changes to these policies and procedures, and to provide recommendations for improvement.

The study used a qualitative case study design with a purposeful sample of five districts recruited from a database of 459 districts who experienced a case of school employee sexual misconduct in 2014. The study was conducted between January 2016 and September 2017.\r\nData collected included: 1) various district documents, 2) 41 interviews with primary actors (school employees and county officials directly involved in responding to the incident), 3) 10 focus groups with 51 secondary actors (school employees who were not directly involved with the incident but who might have been indirectly affected by it), and 4) offender, victim and district characteristics. Documents reviewed included written policies and protocols, training materials and handbooks for staff and students, case documents, and other guiding documents as applicable. In interviews and focus groups, participants were asked to discuss their knowledge of district policies and procedures, to describe the dissemination of and any changes to these policies and procedures, and to provide recommendations for improvement. To protect the confidentiality all district and participant identifying information is confidential and has been removed from any reporting.",

The Project READY (Reducing Aggression in Dating Relationships for Youth) is a theory-driven, empirically supported, brief intervention. READY intercepts youth who utilize an urban emergency department for non-urgent health care (e.g., sprains), provides them with tailored feedback about their relationship behavior, and uses motivational interviewing to move them towards non-violence and respect. READY was designed to avoid victim-blaming and is responsive to the gendered dynamic of ADA. A small feasibility pilot test of READY was completed in 2013 (N=27).\r\nParticipants were 173 youth ages 15-19 years old who were patients of an urban pediatric emergency department. Youth who perpetrated at least 1 act of physical or sexual ADA 3 months prior to baseline were eligible. The proposed experimental evaluation of READY used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with 3- and 6-month follow-ups to assess changes in knowledge, attitude and perpetration behavior.\r\nThe hypotheses are: (1) Youth who participate in the brief intervention session and telephone booster call will report improved knowledge and attitudes, and less self-reported ADA perpetration up to 6 months post-intervention as compared to youth in the control group; and (2) the cost of providing the intervention will be less than the cost of the violence that occurs in its absence. Mixed effects linear and logistic models were used to analyze longitudinal data.",

The general goal of this project was to test whether risk terrain modeling (RTM) could accurately and effectively predict different crime types occurring across New York City. The ultimate aim was to build an enforcement prediction model to test strategies for effectiveness before deploying resources. Three separate phases were completed to assess the effectiveness and applicability of RTM to New York City and the NYPD.

-            "description": "The purpose of this study was to conduct a national-scale\r\n evaluation of correctional facilities housing female offenders in\r\n order to assess the effectiveness of current programs, including\r\n alternative sanctions and treatment programs, and management\r\n practices. The goal was to gather information on \"what works for\r\n which women\" with respect to the program characteristics most related\r\n to positive outcomes. The first stage of the study consisted of\r\n gathering the opinions of administrators in state departments of\r\n corrections, including state-level administrators and administrators\r\n in institutions for women (Part 1). Administrators from jails that\r\n housed women were also interviewed (Part 2). Data collected for Parts\r\n 1 and 2 focused on attitudes toward the influx of women into jails and\r\n prisons, the needs of incarcerated women, and management and program\r\n approaches for meeting those needs. Respondents were asked to identify\r\n programs that in their view stood out as especially effective in\r\n meeting the needs of incarcerated women. From this list of nominated\r\n programs, researchers conducted 62 in-depth telephone interviews with\r\n administrators of programs located in jails, prisons, and the\r\n community (Part 3). A supplement to this study consisted of telephone\r\n interviews with 11 program directors who headed mental health programs\r\n that appeared to be \"state of the art\" for incarcerated women (Part\r\n 4). Variables in Parts 1-4 that concern the nominated programs include\r\n the underlying principles guiding the programs, whom the programs\r\n targeted, what types of staff were employed by the programs, the most\r\n positive effects of the programs, and whether program evaluations had\r\n been completed. Program effort variables found in Parts 1-4 cover\r\n whether the programs focused on trying to treat substance abuse, stop\r\n child abuse, provide women with nontraditional job skills, parenting\r\n skills, HIV/AIDS education, and life skills, change cognitive\r\n thinking, and/or promote self-esteem. Several variables common to\r\n Parts 1-3 include whether the programs provided women with\r\n follow-up/transitional help, helped to stimulate pre-release planning,\r\n allowed visits between women and children, or used ex-offenders,\r\n ex-substance users, volunteers, or outside community groups to work\r\n with the women. Variables focusing on the types of assessment tools\r\n used cover medical assessments, VD screening, reading/math ability\r\n screening, mental health screening, substance abuse screening, needs\r\n regarding children screening, and victim-spouse abuse\r\n screening. Variables pertaining to institution management include\r\n background knowledge needed to manage a facility, the types of\r\n management styles used for managing female offenders, security and\r\n other operational issues, problems with cross-sex supervision, and\r\n handling complaints. Similar variables across Parts 1, 2, and 4 deal\r\n with the impact of private or state funding, such as respondents'\r\n views on the positive and negative outcomes of privatization and of\r\n using state services. Both Parts 1 and 2 contain information on\r\n respondents' views regarding the unique needs of women offenders,\r\n which programs were especially for women, and which program needs were\r\n more serious than others. Planning variables in Parts 1 and 2 include\r\n whether there were plans to have institutions link with other state\r\n agencies, and which programs were most in need of expansion. Further\r\n common variables concerned the influx of women in prison, including\r\n how administrators were dealing with the increasing number of women\r\n offenders, whether the facilities were originally designed for women,\r\n how the facilities adapted for women, and the number of women\r\n currently in the facilities. In addition, Part 1 contains unique\r\n variables on alternative, intermediate sanction options for women,\r\n such as the percentage of women sent to day supervision/treatment and\r\n sent to work release centers, why it was possible to use intermediate\r\n sanctions, and how decisions were made to use intermediate\r\n sanctions. Variables dealing with funding and the provision of\r\n services to women include the type of private contractor or government\r\n agency that provided drug treatment, academic services, and vocational\r\n services to women, and the nature of the medical and food services\r\n provided to women. Variables unique to Part 2 pertain to the type of\r\n offender the jail housed, including whether the jurisdiction had a\r\n separate facility for pretrial or sentenced offenders, the total rated\r\n capacity of the jail, the average daily population of pretrial\r\n females, whether the jail was currently housing state inmates, and the\r\n impact on local inmates of being housed with state inmates. Variables\r\n concerning classification and assessment focused on the purpose of the\r\n classification process for female offenders, whether the\r\n classification process was different for male and female offenders,\r\n and a description of the process used. Variables specific to Part 3\r\n deal with characteristics of the participants, such as whether program\r\n participants were involved in a case management system, the\r\n approximate number of women and men participating in the programs,\r\n whether offenders were tried and awaiting sentence or were on\r\n probation, and the number of hours a week that individuals\r\n participated in the program. Program structure variables include\r\n whether the program was culture- or gender-specific, restrictions on\r\n program participants, and who established the\r\n restrictions. Programming strategy variables cover identifying\r\n strategies used for meeting the needs of women offenders with short\r\n sentences, strategies for women with long sentences, and what stood in\r\n the way of greater use of intermediate sanctions. Part 4 contains\r\n variables on the size of the mental health program/unit, including the\r\n number of beds in the mental health unit, the number of beds set aside\r\n for different types of diagnoses, and the number of women served\r\n annually. Diagnosis variables provide information on who was\r\n responsible for screening women for mental health needs, whether women\r\n were re-evaluated at any time other than at intake, and the most\r\n common mental health problems of women in the unit. Variables on\r\n running the program include whether the program/unit worked with\r\n private or public hospitals, the factors that hindered coordination of\r\n services among local or state facilities, the types of services\r\n affected by budget constraints, and the strategies used to prevent\r\n women from harming themselves and others. Staffing variables cover the\r\n number of psychologists, social workers, nurses, and correctional\r\n officers that worked in the mental health unit. Demographic variables\r\n were similar for all four data files. These include the institution\r\n level, the type of respondent interviewed, respondents' gender and\r\n educational background, and the number of years they had been in their\r\n positions, were employed in corrections, and had worked in women's\r\nfacilities.",

+            "description": "The purpose of this study was to conduct a national-scale\r\n evaluation of correctional facilities housing female offenders in\r\n order to assess the effectiveness of current programs, including\r\n alternative sanctions and treatment programs, and management\r\n practices. The goal was to gather information on \"what works for\r\n which women\" with respect to the program characteristics most related\r\n to positive outcomes. The first stage of the study consisted of\r\n gathering the opinions of administrators in state departments of\r\n corrections, including state-level administrators and administrators\r\n in institutions for women (Part 1). Administrators from jails that\r\n housed women were also interviewed (Part 2). Data collected for Parts\r\n 1 and 2 focused on attitudes toward the influx of women into jails and\r\n prisons, the needs of incarcerated women, and management and program\r\n approaches for meeting those needs. Respondents were asked to identify\r\n programs that in their view stood out as especially effective in\r\n meeting the needs of incarcerated women. From this list of nominated\r\n programs, researchers conducted 62 in-depth telephone interviews with\r\n administrators of programs located in jails, prisons, and the\r\n community (Part 3). A supplement to this study consisted of telephone\r\n interviews with 11 program directors who headed mental health programs\r\n that appeared to be \"state of the art\" for incarcerated women (Part\r\n 4). Variables in Parts 1-4 that concern the nominated programs include\r\n the underlying principles guiding the programs, whom the programs\r\n targeted, what types of staff were employed by the programs, the most\r\n positive effects of the programs, and whether program evaluations had\r\n been completed. Program effort variables found in Parts 1-4 cover\r\n whether the programs focused on trying to treat substance abuse, stop\r\n child abuse, provide women with nontraditional job skills, parenting\r\n skills, HIV/AIDS education, and life skills, change cognitive\r\n thinking, and/or promote self-esteem. Several variables common to\r\n Parts 1-3 include whether the programs provided women with\r\n follow-up/transitional help, helped to stimulate pre-release planning,\r\n allowed visits between women and children, or used ex-offenders,\r\n ex-substance users, volunteers, or outside community groups to work\r\n with the women. Variables focusing on the types of assessment tools\r\n used cover medical assessments, VD screening, reading/math ability\r\n screening, mental health screening, substance abuse screening, needs\r\n regarding children screening, and victim-spouse abuse\r\n screening. Variables pertaining to institution management include\r\n background knowledge needed to manage a facility, the types of\r\n management styles used for managing female offenders, security and\r\n other operational issues, problems with cross-sex supervision, and\r\n handling complaints. Similar variables across Parts 1, 2, and 4 deal\r\n with the impact of private or state funding, such as respondents'\r\n views on the positive and negative outcomes of privatization and of\r\n using state services. Both Parts 1 and 2 contain information on\r\n respondents' views regarding the unique needs of women offenders,\r\n which programs were especially for women, and which program needs were\r\n more serious than others. Planning variables in Parts 1 and 2 include\r\n whether there were plans to have institutions link with other state\r\n agencies, and which programs were most in need of expansion. Further\r\n common variables concerned the influx of women in prison, including\r\n how administrators were dealing with the increasing number of women\r\n offenders, whether the facilities were originally designed for women,\r\n how the facilities adapted for women, and the number of women\r\n currently in the facilities. In addition, Part 1 contains unique\r\n variables on alternative, intermediate sanction options for women,\r\n such as the percentage of women sent to day supervision/treatment and\r\n sent to work release centers, why it was possible to use intermediate\r\n sanctions, and how decisions were made to use intermediate\r\n sanctions. Variables dealing with funding and the provision of\r\n services to women include the type of private contractor or government\r\n agency that provided drug treatment, academic services, and vocational\r\n services to women, and the nature of the medical and food services\r\n provided to women. Variables unique to Part 2 pertain to the type of\r\n offender the jail housed, including whether the jurisdiction had a\r\n separate facility for pretrial or sentenced offenders, the total rated\r\n capacity of the jail, the average daily population of pretrial\r\n females, whether the jail was currently housing state inmates, and the\r\n impact on local inmates of being housed with state inmates. Variables\r\n concerning classification and assessment focused on the purpose of the\r\n classification process for female offenders, whether the\r\n classification process was different for male and female offenders,\r\n and a description of the process used. Variables specific to Part 3\r\n deal with characteristics of the participants, such as whether program\r\n participants were involved in a case management system, the\r\n approximate number of women and men participating in the programs,\r\n whether offenders were tried and awaiting sentence or were on\r\n probation, and the number of hours a week that individuals\r\n participated in the program. Program structure variables include\r\n whether the program was culture- or gender-specific, restrictions on\r\n program participants, and who established the\r\n restrictions. Programming strategy variables cover identifying\r\n strategies used for meeting the needs of women offenders with short\r\n sentences, strategies for women with long sentences, and what stood in\r\n the way of greater use of intermediate sanctions. Part 4 contains\r\n variables on the size of the mental health program/unit, including the\r\n number of beds in the mental health unit, the number of beds set aside\r\n for different types of diagnoses, and the number of women served\r\n annually. Diagnosis variables provide information on who was\r\n responsible for screening women for mental health needs, whether women\r\n were re-evaluated at any time other than at intake, and the most\r\n common mental health problems of women in the unit. Variables on\r\n running the program include whether the program/unit worked with\r\n private or public hospitals, the factors that hindered coordination of\r\n services among local or state facilities, the types of services\r\n affected by budget constraints, and the strategies used to prevent\r\n women from harming themselves and others. Staffing variables cover the\r\n number of psychologists, social workers, nurses, and correctional\r\n officers that worked in the mental health unit. Demographic variables\r\n were similar for all four data files. These include the institution\r\n level, the type of respondent interviewed, respondents' gender and\r\n educational background, and the number of years they had been in their\r\n positions, were employed in corrections, and had worked in women's\r\nfacilities.",

-            "description": "This study had a variety of aims: (1) to assess the needs\r\n of violent crime victims, (2) to document the services that were\r\n available to violent crime victims in the San Diego region, (3) to\r\n assess the level of service utilization by different segments of the\r\n population, (4) to determine how individuals cope with victimization\r\n and how coping ability varies as a function of victim and crime\r\n characteristics, (5) to document the set of factors related to\r\n satisfaction with the criminal justice system, (6) to recommend\r\n improvements in the delivery of services to victims, and (7) to\r\n identify issues for future research. Data were collected using five\r\n different survey instruments. The first survey was sent to over 3,000\r\n violent crime victims over the age of 16 and to approximately 60\r\n homicide witnesses and survivors in the San Diego region (Part 1,\r\n Initial Victims' Survey Data). Of the 718 victims who returned the\r\n initial survey, 330 victims were recontacted six months later (Part 2,\r\n Follow-Up Victims' Survey Data). Respondents in Part 1 were asked what\r\n type of violent crime occurred, whether they sustained injury, whether\r\n they received medical treatment, what the nature of their relationship\r\n to the suspect was, and if the suspect had been arrested. Respondents\r\n for both Parts 1 and 2 were asked which service providers, if any,\r\n contacted them at the time of the incident or afterwards. Respondents\r\n were also asked what type of services they needed and received at the\r\n time of the incident or afterwards. Respondents in Part 2 rated the\r\n overall service and helpfulness of the information received at the\r\n time of the incident and after, and their level of satisfaction\r\n regarding contact with the police, prosecutor, and judge handling\r\n their case. Respondents in Part 2 were also asked what sort of\r\n financial loss resulted from the incident, and whether federal, state,\r\n local, or private agencies provided financial assistance to\r\n them. Finally, respondents in Part 1 and Part 2 were asked about the\r\n physical and psychological effects of their victimization. Demographic\r\n variables for Part 1 and Part 2 include the marital status, employment\r\n status, and type of job of each violent crime\r\n victim/witness/survivor. Part 1 also includes the race, sex, and\r\n highest level of education of each respondent. Police and court case\r\n files were reviewed six months after the incident occurred for each\r\n initial sample case. Data regarding victim and incident\r\n characteristics were collected from original arrest reports, jail\r\n booking screens, and court dockets (Part 3, Tracking Data). The\r\n variables for Part 3 include the total number of victims, survivors,\r\n and witnesses of violent crimes, place of attack, evidence collected,\r\n and which service providers were at the scene of the crime. Part 3\r\n also includes a detailed list of the services provided to the\r\n victim/witness/survivor at the scene of the crime and after. These\r\n services included counseling, explanation of medical and police\r\n procedures, self-defense and crime prevention classes, food, clothing,\r\n psychological/psychiatric services, and help with court\r\n processes. Additional Part 3 variables cover circumstances of the\r\n incident, initial custody status of suspects, involvement of victims\r\n and witnesses at hearings, and case outcome, including disposition and\r\n sentencing. The race, sex, and age of each victim/witness/survivor are\r\n also recorded in Part 3 along with the same demographics for each\r\n suspect. Data for Part 4, Intervention Programs Survey Data, were\r\n gathered using a third survey, which was distributed to members of the\r\n three following intervention programs: (1) the San Diego Crisis\r\n Intervention Team, (2) the EYE Counseling and Crisis Services, Crisis\r\n and Advocacy Team, and (3) the District Attorney's Victim-Witness\r\n Assistance Program. A modified version of the survey with a subset of\r\n the original questions was administered one year later to members of\r\n the San Diego Crisis Intervention Team (Part 5, Crisis Intervention\r\n Team Survey Data) and to the EYE Counseling and Crisis Services,\r\n Crisis and Advocacy Team (Part 6, EYE Crisis and Advocacy Team Survey\r\n Data). The survey questions for Parts 4-6 asked each respondent to\r\n provide their reasons for becoming involved with the program, the\r\n goals of the program, responsibilities of the staff or volunteers, the\r\n types of referral services their agency provided, the number of hours\r\n of training required, and the topics covered in the\r\n training. Respondents for Parts 4-6 were further asked about the\r\n specific types of services they provided to\r\n victims/witnesses/survivors. Part 4 also contains a series of\r\n variables regarding coordination efforts, problems, and resolutions\r\n encountered when dealing with other intervention agencies and law\r\n enforcement agencies. Demographic variables for Parts 4-6 include the\r\n ethnicity, age, gender, and highest level of education of each\r\n respondent, and whether the respondent was a staff member of the\r\n agency or volunteer. The fourth survey was mailed to 53 referral\r\n agencies used by police and crisis interventionists (Part 7, Service\r\n Provider Survey Data). Part 7 contains the same series of variables as\r\n Part 4 on dealing with other intervention and law enforcement\r\n agencies. Respondents in Part 7 were further asked to describe the\r\n type of victims/witnesses/survivors to whom they provided service\r\n (e.g., domestic violence victims, homicide witnesses, or suicide\r\n survivors) and to rate their level of satisfaction with referral\r\n procedures provided by law enforcement officers, hospitals,\r\n paramedics, religious groups, the San Diego Crisis Intervention Team,\r\n the EYE Crisis Team, and the District Attorney's Victim/Witness\r\n Program. Part 7 also includes the hours of operation for each service\r\n provider organization, as well as which California counties they\r\n serviced. Finally, respondents in Part 7 were given a list of services\r\n and asked if they provided any of those services to\r\n victims/witnesses/survivors. Services unique to this list included job\r\n placement assistance, public awareness campaigns, accompaniment to\r\n court, support groups, and advocacy with outside agencies (e.g.,\r\n employers or creditors). Demographic variables for Part 7 include the\r\n ethnicity, age, and gender of each respondent. The last survey was\r\n distributed to over 1,000 law enforcement officers from the Escondido,\r\n San Diego, and Vista sheriff's agencies (Part 8, Law Enforcement\r\n Survey Data). Respondents in Part 8 were surveyed to determine their\r\n familiarity with intervention programs, how they learned about the\r\n program, the extent to which they used or referred others to\r\n intervention services, appropriate circumstances for calling or not\r\n calling in interventionists, their opinions regarding various\r\n intervention programs, their interactions with interventionists at\r\n crime scenes, and suggestions for improving delivery of services to\r\n victims. Demographic variables for Part 8 include the rank and agency\r\nof each law enforcement respondent.",

-            "description": "The goal of this project was to investigate the effects of\r\nchildren's out-of-court hearsay statements on jurors' perceptions of\r\nwitness credibility and defendant guilt. To accomplish this goal,\r\nthree studies were conducted. The studies represented a series of\r\nincreasingly ecologically valid investigations: mock jurors'\r\nperceptions of children's live and hearsay statements about a mock\r\ncrime (Study 1), mock jurors' perceptions of real child sexual abuse\r\nvictims' hearsay statements (Study 2), and actual jurors' perceptions\r\nof real child sexual abuse victims' hearsay statements (Study 3). In\r\nthese contexts, \"hearsay statements\" are the repetition of a child's\r\nout-of-court statements in a court trial, either via a videotaped\r\nrecording of the child's testimony in a forensic interview with a\r\nsocial worker or as described by an adult (the social worker or a\r\npolice officer) who interviewed the child. The three studies permitted\r\nresearchers to examine factors that jurors use to evaluate the\r\nreliability of children's hearsay evidence. The mock crime in Study 1\r\nwas touching the child on the stomach, nose, or neck. Jurors were\r\ninstructed to consider those acts as if they were battery against a\r\nchild. In Study 1, elaborate mock trials concerning the above mock\r\ncrime were conducted under three trial conditions: (1) the child\r\ntestified live in court, (2) a videotape of a simulated forensic\r\ninterview with the child was presented, or (3) adult hearsay was\r\npresented (i.e., a social worker testified about what the child had\r\nsaid in the simulated forensic interview). A total of 370 mock jurors\r\nparticipated in Study 1, which was conducted in Sacramento County,\r\nCalifornia. In Study 2, videotapes of actual forensic interviews from\r\nreal child sexual abuse cases were incorporated into mock trials\r\ninstead of having live child testimony. The last two trial conditions\r\nin Study 2 were the same as those for Study 1, except that a police\r\nofficer provided the adult hearsay testimony instead of a social\r\nworker. For Study 2, 170 mock jurors served on 15 main juries, which\r\nwere held in Sacramento County, California. For both Studies 1 and 2,\r\npre- and post-deliberation questionnaires were completed by mock\r\njurors to ascertain their views on the credibility of the child and\r\nadult testimonies, the importance of various pieces of evidence, and\r\nthe guilt of the defendant. Demographic questionnaires were also\r\nfilled out before the mock trials. In Study 3, real jurors from actual\r\nchild sexual abuse trials were surveyed regarding their judgments of\r\nchild and adult testimonies. The three trial conditions that were\r\npresent in Studies 1 and 2 (live child testimony, videotaped\r\ntestimony, and adult hearsay testimony) were also experienced by the\r\nStudy 3 participants. These jurors also indicated the importance of\r\nvarious types of evidence and provided demographic data. A total of\r\n248 jurors representing 43 juries from Sacramento County, California,\r\nand Maricopa County, Arizona, participated in Study 3. This collection\r\nincludes aggregated data prepared from the Study 3 data to provide\r\nmean values for each of the 42 juries, as calculated from the\r\nindividual juror responses. Data for one jury were eliminated from the\r\naggregated data by the principal investigators. Variables from the\r\ndemographic questionnaire for Studies 1 and 2 include trial condition,\r\nrespondent's age, gender, marital status, occupation, ethnic\r\nbackground, religious orientation, and highest grade attained in\r\nschool, if the respondent supported the death penalty, if the\r\nrespondent was ever a victim of crime, number of children the\r\nrespondent had, if the respondent was a United States citizen, if the\r\nrespondent's native language was English, and if he or she had ever\r\nbeen a police officer, a convicted felon, a lawyer, or a judge. The\r\npre-deliberation questionnaire for Study 1 asked jurors if they felt\r\nthat the defendant was guilty, and how confident they were of the\r\ndefendant's guilt or innocence. Jurors were also asked to assess the\r\naccuracy of various facts as given in the social worker's interview of\r\nthe child and the child's statements in the taped interview, and what\r\nthe likelihood was of the child's being influenced by the social\r\nworker, prosecutor, and/or defense attorney. Questions about the trial\r\nincluded the juror's assessment of the defendant, the social worker,\r\nand the research assistant. Jurors were also asked about the influence\r\nof various factors on their decisions regarding whether to believe the\r\nindividuals in the case. Jurors' open-ended comments were coded on the\r\nmost important factors in believing or doubting the child or the\r\nsocial worker, the most important evidence in the case, and whether\r\nanything could have been done to make the trial more\r\nfair. Post-deliberation questions in Study 1 included whether the\r\ndefendant was guilty, how confident the juror was of the defendant's\r\nguilt or innocence regarding various charges in the case, and the\r\nfinal verdict of the jury. Questions similar to those in Study 1 were\r\nasked in the pre-deliberation questionnaire for Study 2, which also\r\nincluded respondents' opinions of the police officer, the mother, the\r\ndoctor, and the use of anatomical dolls. The Study 2 post-deliberation\r\nquestionnaire included questions on whether the defendant was guilty,\r\nhow confident the juror was of the defendant's guilt or innocence, and\r\nthe juror's assessment of the social worker's videotaped interview and\r\nthe police officer's testimony. Variables from the Study 3 juror\r\nsurvey include the county/state where the trial was held, the juror's\r\nage, gender, ethnic background, and highest grade attained in school,\r\nif the juror supported the death penalty, if he or she was ever a\r\nvictim of crime, and the amount of contact he or she had with\r\nchildren. Questions about the trial include the number of children the\r\ndefendant was charged with abusing, the main child's age and gender,\r\nif a videotape was shown at trial, who interviewed the child on the\r\nvideotape, the impact of seeing the videotape on the juror's decision\r\nto believe the child, the number of children who testified at the\r\ntrial, and if the child was involved in a custody dispute. Additional\r\nquestions focused on the defendant's relationship to the main child,\r\nwho the first person was that the child told about the abuse, if the\r\nmain child testified in court, the most important evidence in the case\r\nin the opinion of the juror, the jury's verdict, and how fair the\r\njuror considered the trial. Finally, jurors were asked about the\r\ninfluence of various factors on their decision to believe or doubt the\r\nindividuals in the case. Data in Study 3 also include coded open-ended\r\nresponses to several questions. Variables provided for the Study 3\r\naggregated data consist of the calculated mean values for each of the\r\n42 juries for most of the variables in the Study 3 juror survey data.",

The\r\n evaluation was undertaken by the Free Our Citizens of Unhealthy\r\n Substances Coalition (FOCUS), a county-based group of citizens who\r\n represented all segments of the community, including businesses,\r\n churches, local law enforcement agencies, and local governments. The\r\n aim was to find answers to the following questions: (1) Can community\r\n policing have any detectable and measurable impact in a predominantly\r\n rural setting? (2) Did the police department do what they said they\r\n would do in their funding application? (3) If they were successful,\r\n what factors supported their efforts and were key to their success?\r\n and (4) If they were not successful, what problems prevented their\r\n success? The coalition conducted citizen surveys to evaluate how much\r\n of an impact community policing initiatives had in their county. In\r\n January 1996, research assistants conducted a baseline survey of 300\r\n households in the county. Survey responses were intended to gauge\r\n residents' fear of crime and to assess how well the police were\r\n performing their duties. After one year, the coalition repeated its\r\n survey of public attitudes, and research assistants interviewed\r\n another 300 households. The research assumption was that any change in\r\n fear of crime or assessment of police performance could reasonably be\r\n attributed to these new community policing inventions. Crime reporting\r\n variables from the survey included which crime most concerned the\r\n respondent, if the respondent would report a crime he or she observed,\r\n and whether the respondent would testify about the crime in\r\n court. Variables pertaining to level of concern for specific crimes\r\n include how concerned respondents were that someone would rob or\r\n attack them, break into or vandalize their home, or try to sexually\r\n attack them/someone they cared about. Community involvement variables\r\n covered participation in community groups or activities, neighborhood\r\n associations, church, or informal social activities. Police/citizen\r\n interaction variables focused on the number of times respondents had\r\n called to report a problem to the police in the last two years, how\r\n satisfied they were with how the police handled the problem, the\r\n extent to which this police department needed improvement, whether\r\n children trusted law enforcement officers, whether police needed to\r\n respond more quickly to calls, whether the police needed improved\r\n relations with the community, and in the past year whether local\r\n police performance had improved/gotten worse. Specific crime\r\n information variables include whether the crime occurred in the\r\n respondent's neighborhood, whether he/she was the victim, if crime was\r\n serious in the respondent's neighborhood versus elsewhere, whether the\r\n respondent had considered moving as a result of crime in the\r\n neighborhood, and how personal safety had changed in the respondent's\r\n neighborhood. Variables relating to community policing include whether\r\n the respondent had heard the term \"community policing\" in the past\r\n year, from what source, and what community policing activities the\r\n respondent was aware of. Demographic variables include job\r\n self-classification, racial/ethnic identity, length of residency, age,\r\n gender, martial status, educational status, and respondent's town of\r\nresidence.",

-            "description": "This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship,\r\n if any, between drug treatment and success or failure of drug-involved\r\n offenders on probation/community supervision. Further, the researchers\r\n sought to evaluate the outcomes of drug-involved offenders admitted to\r\n (1) secure residential substance abuse treatment (RSAT) programs, (2)\r\n non-secure residential drug treatment programs, (3) non-residential\r\n drug treatment programs, and (4) no drug treatment programs. Data were\r\n collected from administrative records provided by the Florida\r\n Department of Corrections, specifically case history records of\r\n offenders admitted to supervision in the community from July 1, 1991,\r\n through June 30, 1997. Part 1 is comprised of all cases admitted to\r\n community supervision between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1993 (fiscal\r\n years 1991 and 1992) and treated in a secure residential drug treatment\r\n program. Part 2 is comprised of all cases admitted to community\r\n supervision from July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1995, receiving\r\n treatment in a non-secure residential drug treatment program. Part 3\r\n contains data on offenders admitted to non-residential drug treatment\r\n programs, whose community supervision admissions were between July 1,\r\n 1991, and June 30, 1993. Part 4 contains data on offenders admitted to\r\n non-residential drug treatment programs, whose community supervision\r\n admissions were between July 1, 1993, and June 30, 1995 (fiscal years\r\n 1993 and 1994). Part 5 contains data on cases admitted to community\r\n supervision between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1993, who did not\r\n receive drug treatment of any kind.

Data were\r\n collected from administrative records provided by the Florida\r\n Department of Corrections, specifically case history records of\r\n offenders admitted to supervision in the community from July 1, 1991,\r\n through June 30, 1997.

Part 3\r\n contains data on offenders admitted to non-residential drug treatment\r\n programs, whose community supervision admissions were between July 1,\r\n 1991, and June 30, 1993.

-            "description": "In 1990, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation\r\n that established the Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Program,\r\n a program providing child advocates in juvenile court proceedings,\r\n especially those involving abuse and neglect. The Virginia Department\r\n of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) administered this program. In this\r\n capacity, the DCJS coordinated services, provided funds, and\r\n participated in the development and dissemination of program\r\n information and regulations. Given these responsibilities, DCJS'\r\n Juvenile Services Section and the Criminal Justice Research Center\r\n Evaluation Section agreed that an assessment of the CASA program was\r\n needed. This study sought to evaluate the Virginia CASA program in\r\n order to provide a better understanding of CASA activities and program\r\n characteristics, and determine the impact of CASA intervention on its\r\n client population. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected\r\n from three sources: (1) administrative records gathered for a sample\r\n of 78 cases (Part 1) involving 164 children (Part 2) taken from the\r\n files of local juvenile courts, social service agencies, and CASA\r\n programs, (2) telephone interviews administered to judges (Part 3)\r\n presiding in all operational CASA jurisdictions across Virginia,\r\n and (3) surveys distributed to CASA social workers (Part 4) and\r\n volunteers (Part 5). Variables common to both Part 1 and Part 2\r\n include the total number of abuse/neglect, custody, and Children in\r\n Need of Supervision/Services (CHINS) petitions, date of first\r\n petition, petition type, type of child abuse/neglect case, number and\r\n date of prior removals from home, number of out-of-home, group home,\r\n psychiatric, detention, and family/friend placements since the case\r\n opened, whether there was any alcohol or drug abuse involved, and the\r\n onset of these behaviors, whether there were any mental, intellectual,\r\n academic, or behavioral limitations or problems, dates of first and\r\n last court proceeding, date of finding (a social service agency\r\n determination of whether abuse/neglect occurred), permanency date,\r\n date of final placement, and the number of weeks a Court-Appointed\r\n Special Advocate (CASA) was on the case. Variables unique to Part 1\r\n include the age, sex, and date of birth for up to six victims and up\r\n to three abusers, as well as whether any adult or child sibling of the\r\n victim had been legally removed from the household, the relationship\r\n of each abuser to each victim, and whether any of the victim's\r\n siblings, mother, biological father, or caretaker had a criminal\r\n history, mental illness, disabilities, or abused drugs or\r\n alcohol. Other variables include the number of orders partially or\r\n fully complied with or not complied with, the number of services\r\n ordered for each victim and abuser, and whether there were any changes\r\n in the family structure. For Part 3, judges were surveyed to determine\r\n their perceptions regarding the role of CASAs, social workers, and\r\n Guardians ad Litem (GALs) in abuse/neglect cases, the benefits of the\r\n CASA program, how successful CASA case monitoring was, how useful CASA\r\n information was, and the impact CASA programs had on the court\r\n process. Judges also recommended changes or improvements they felt\r\n were needed by the CASA program that served their court. The percent\r\n of abuse/neglect, custody, and CHINS cases that each judge presided\r\n over is also included. Demographic variables for Part 4 include the\r\n age, sex, and race of each social worker. Other variables cover the\r\n length of time worked with CASAs, the number of sexual abuse, neglect,\r\n custody, and CHINS cases worked on, and the percent of time used to\r\n appear in court, write reports, review records, interview the family\r\n and child, and speak with CASAs and GALs. The respondents' perceptions\r\n of the role of CASA, social workers, and GALs, how the CASA program\r\n was beneficial or detrimental to a child, and suggestions for changes\r\n or improvements to the CASA program complete the file. Variables for\r\n Part 5 include the number of physical abuse, neglect, custody, and\r\n CHINS cases worked on by a CASA volunteer. Additional variables\r\n include the percent of time used to investigate and monitor the child,\r\n family, foster family, the GALs, the social worker, and other CASA\r\n staff, as well as the volunteer's relationship with social workers,\r\n GALs, and judges. The age, sex, race, and educational background of\r\neach volunteer are also included.",

+            "description": "In 1990, the Virginia General Assembly enacted legislation\r\n that established the Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) Program,\r\n a program providing child advocates in juvenile court proceedings,\r\n especially those involving abuse and neglect. The Virginia Department\r\n of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) administered this program. In this\r\n capacity, the DCJS coordinated services, provided funds, and\r\n participated in the development and dissemination of program\r\n information and regulations. Given these responsibilities, DCJS'\r\n Juvenile Services Section and the Criminal Justice Research Center\r\n Evaluation Section agreed that an assessment of the CASA program was\r\n needed. This study sought to evaluate the Virginia CASA program in\r\n order to provide a better understanding of CASA activities and program\r\n characteristics, and determine the impact of CASA intervention on its\r\n client population. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected\r\n from three sources: (1) administrative records gathered for a sample\r\n of 78 cases (Part 1) involving 164 children (Part 2) taken from the\r\n files of local juvenile courts, social service agencies, and CASA\r\n programs, (2) telephone interviews administered to judges (Part 3)\r\n presiding in all operational CASA jurisdictions across Virginia,\r\n and (3) surveys distributed to CASA social workers (Part 4) and\r\n volunteers (Part 5). Variables common to both Part 1 and Part 2\r\n include the total number of abuse/neglect, custody, and Children in\r\n Need of Supervision/Services (CHINS) petitions, date of first\r\n petition, petition type, type of child abuse/neglect case, number and\r\n date of prior removals from home, number of out-of-home, group home,\r\n psychiatric, detention, and family/friend placements since the case\r\n opened, whether there was any alcohol or drug abuse involved, and the\r\n onset of these behaviors, whether there were any mental, intellectual,\r\n academic, or behavioral limitations or problems, dates of first and\r\n last court proceeding, date of finding (a social service agency\r\n determination of whether abuse/neglect occurred), permanency date,\r\n date of final placement, and the number of weeks a Court-Appointed\r\n Special Advocate (CASA) was on the case. Variables unique to Part 1\r\n include the age, sex, and date of birth for up to six victims and up\r\n to three abusers, as well as whether any adult or child sibling of the\r\n victim had been legally removed from the household, the relationship\r\n of each abuser to each victim, and whether any of the victim's\r\n siblings, mother, biological father, or caretaker had a criminal\r\n history, mental illness, disabilities, or abused drugs or\r\n alcohol. Other variables include the number of orders partially or\r\n fully complied with or not complied with, the number of services\r\n ordered for each victim and abuser, and whether there were any changes\r\n in the family structure. For Part 3, judges were surveyed to determine\r\n their perceptions regarding the role of CASAs, social workers, and\r\n Guardians ad Litem (GALs) in abuse/neglect cases, the benefits of the\r\n CASA program, how successful CASA case monitoring was, how useful CASA\r\n information was, and the impact CASA programs had on the court\r\n process. Judges also recommended changes or improvements they felt\r\n were needed by the CASA program that served their court. The percent\r\n of abuse/neglect, custody, and CHINS cases that each judge presided\r\n over is also included. Demographic variables for Part 4 include the\r\n age, sex, and race of each social worker. Other variables cover the\r\n length of time worked with CASAs, the number of sexual abuse, neglect,\r\n custody, and CHINS cases worked on, and the percent of time used to\r\n appear in court, write reports, review records, interview the family\r\n and child, and speak with CASAs and GALs. The respondents' perceptions\r\n of the role of CASA, social workers, and GALs, how the CASA program\r\n was beneficial or detrimental to a child, and suggestions for changes\r\n or improvements to the CASA program complete the file. Variables for\r\n Part 5 include the number of physical abuse, neglect, custody, and\r\n CHINS cases worked on by a CASA volunteer. Additional variables\r\n include the percent of time used to investigate and monitor the child,\r\n family, foster family, the GALs, the social worker, and other CASA\r\n staff, as well as the volunteer's relationship with social workers,\r\n GALs, and judges. The age, sex, race, and educational background of\r\neach volunteer are also included.",

-            "description": "Beginning in 1996, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)\r\ninitiated a major redesign of its multisite drug-monitoring program,\r\nthe Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) system (DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24\r\nCITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]). The program was\r\nretitled Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) (see ARRESTEE DRUG\r\nABUSE MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 1998 [ICPSR\r\n2628] and 1999 [ICPSR 2994]). ADAM extended DUF in the number of sites\r\nand improved the quality and generalizability of the data. The\r\nredesign was fully implemented in all sites beginning in the first\r\nquarter of 2000. The ADAM program implemented a new and expanded adult\r\ninstrument in the first quarter of 2000, which was used for both the\r\nmale (Part 1) and female (Part 2) data. The juvenile data for 2000\r\n(Part 3) used the juvenile instrument from previous years. The ADAM\r\nprogram also moved to probability-based sampling for the adult male\r\npopulation during 2000. Therefore, the 2000 adult male sample includes\r\nweights, generated through post-sampling stratification of the\r\ndata. The shift to sampling of the adult male population in 2000\r\nrequired that all 35 sites move to a common catchment area, the\r\ncounty. The core instrument for the adult cases was supplemented by a\r\nfacesheet, which was used to collect demographic and charge\r\ninformation from official records. Core instruments were used to\r\ncollect self-report information from the respondent. Both the adult\r\nand juvenile instruments were administered to persons arrested and\r\nbooked on local or state charges relevant to the jurisdiction (i.e.,\r\nnot federal or out-of-county charges) within the past 48 hours. At the\r\ncompletion of the interview the arrestee was asked to voluntarily\r\nprovide a urine specimen. An external lab used the Enzyme Multiplied\r\nImmunoassay Testing (EMIT) protocols to test for the presence of ten\r\ndrugs or metabolites of the drug in the urine sample. All amphetamine\r\npositives were confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry\r\n(GC/MS) to determine whether methamphetamine was used. For the adult\r\ndata, variables from the facesheet include arrest precinct, ZIP code\r\nof arrest location, ZIP code of respondent's address, respondent's\r\ngender and race, three most serious arrest charges, sample source\r\n(stock, flow, other), interview status (including reason the\r\nindividual selected in the sample was not interviewed), language of\r\ninstrument used, and the number of hours since arrest. Demographic\r\ninformation from the core instrument includes respondent's age,\r\nethnicity, residency, education, employment, health insurance\r\ncoverage, marital status, housing, and telephone access. Variables\r\nfrom the calendar provide information on inpatient and outpatient\r\nsubstance abuse treatment, inpatient mental health treatment, arrests\r\nand incarcerations, heavy alcohol use, use of marijuana, crack/rock\r\ncocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other drug (ever\r\nand previous 12 months), age of first use of the above six drugs and\r\nheavy alcohol use, drug dependency in the previous 12 months,\r\ncharacteristics of drug transactions in past 30 days, use of\r\nmarijuana, crack/rock cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, and\r\nmethamphetamine in past 30 days, 7 days, and 48 hours, heavy alcohol\r\nuse in past 30 days, and secondary drug use of 15 other drugs in the\r\npast 48 hours. Urine test results are provided for 11 drugs --\r\nmarijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), benzodiazepines\r\n(Valium), propoxyphene (Darvon), methadone, methaqualone,\r\nbarbiturates, amphetamines, and methamphetamine. The adult data files\r\ninclude several derived variables. The male data also include four\r\nsampling weights, and stratum identifications and percents. For the\r\njuvenile data, demographic variables include age, race, sex,\r\neducational attainment, employment status, and living\r\ncircumstances. Data also include each juvenile arrestee's\r\nself-reported use of 15 drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, powder\r\ncocaine, crack, heroin, PCP, amphetamines, barbiturates, quaaludes,\r\nmethadone, crystal methamphetamine, Valium, LSD, and inhalants). For\r\neach drug type, arrestees reported whether they had ever used the\r\ndrug, age of first use, whether they had used the drug in the past 30\r\ndays and past 72 hours, number of days they used the drug in past\r\nmonth, whether they tried to cut down or quit using the drug, if they\r\nwere successful, whether they felt dependent on the drug, whether they\r\nwere receiving treatment for the drug, whether they had received\r\ntreatment for the drug in the past, and whether they thought they\r\ncould use treatment for that drug. Additional variables include\r\nwhether juvenile respondents had ever injected drugs, whether they\r\nwere influenced by drugs when they allegedly committed the crime for\r\nwhich they were arrested, whether they had been to an emergency room\r\nfor drug-related incidents, and if so, whether in the past 12 months,\r\nand information on arrests and charges in the past 12 months. As with\r\nthe adult data, urine test results are also provided. Finally,\r\nvariables covering precinct (precinct of arrest) and law (penal law\r\ncode associated with the crime for which the juvenile was arrested)\r\nare also provided for use by local law enforcement officials at each\r\nsite.",
