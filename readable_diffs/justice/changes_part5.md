In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nprovided its support, formulating a comprehensive redesign\r\neffort. Following a multiyear study and in consultation with local\r\nand state law enforcement executives, new guidelines for the Uniform\r\nCrime Reports were created. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. Annual\r\nNIBRS data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may\r\nbe merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. The Batch Header Segment (Parts 1-3)\r\nseparates and identifies individual police agencies by Originating\r\nAgency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which is contained\r\non three records for each ORI, includes agency name, geographic\r\nlocation, and population of the area. Part 4, Administrative Segment,\r\noffers data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime\r\nincident is delineated by one administrative segment record. Also\r\nprovided are Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon\r\nuse, and bias motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property\r\nloss, property description, property value, drug type and quantity),\r\nPart 7, Victim Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries),\r\nPart 8, Offender Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee\r\nSegment (arrest date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). Part 10,\r\nGroup B Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B\r\ncrimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for\r\nwhich the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the\r\nFBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the\r\nincident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the\r\nincident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS\r\nreporting. As with UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the\r\npart of law enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative\r\nsample of crime in the United States. For 1997, twelve states, fully or\r\npartially participating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\nare archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\nWindow Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\ncomplete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\ngeneral, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\noccurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\noccurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\nUCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

There are six main segment levels: administrative,\r\noffense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment level\r\nhas a different length and layout. There are other segment levels that\r\noccur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significant\r\ncomputing resources are necessary to work with the data in its\r\nsingle-file format. In addition, the user must be sophisticated in\r\nworking with data in complex file types. For these reasons and the\r\ndesire to facilitate the use of NIBRS data, ICPSR created the extract\r\nfiles. The data are not a representative sample of crime in the United\r\nStates.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). The NEISS-AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dataset represents the revised concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2016. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) violent and property crime estimates were significantly higher than 2015, but it was not possible to determine the degree to which the change in rates resulted from the sample redesign rather than real changes in U.S. victimization levels. Therefore, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) examined the 2015 and 2016 victimization rates separately for new and continuing sample counties in the 2016 Criminal Victimization bulletin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BJS requested that the U.S. Census Bureau create a 2016 revised file with outgoing county interviews from July-December 2015, continuing county interviews from January-June 2016, and all interviews (continuing and new counties) from July-December 2016. In other words, the outgoing 2015 cases replaced the new 2016 cases in the first half of 2016. The files in this study serve as a separate research file to allow data users to make comparisons between 2015, 2016, and 2017 NCVS estimates using a nationally representative sample. It provides a sample that still represents the entire country but does not have the inflated crime rates seen in the new counties in 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 37296.\r\n",

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

-            "description": "The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.\r\nThis dataset represents the revised version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 2016. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nThe 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) violent and property crime estimates were significantly higher than 2015, but it was not possible to determine the degree to which the change in rates resulted from the sample redesign rather than real changes in U.S. victimization levels. Therefore, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) examined the 2015 and 2016 victimization rates separately for new and continuing sample counties in the 2016 Criminal Victimization bulletin.\r\nThe BJS requested that the Census Bureau create a 2016 revised file with outgoing county interviews from July-December 2015, continuing county interviews from January-June 2016, and all interviews (continuing and new counties) from July-December 2016. In other words, the outgoing 2015 cases replaced the new 2016 cases in the first half of 2016. The files in this study serve as a separate research file to allow data users to make comparisons between 2015, 2016, and 2017 NCVS estimates using a nationally representative sample. It provides a sample that still represents the entire country but does not have the inflated crime rates seen in the new counties in 2016.",

-            "description": "The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously called the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2018. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 37297.",

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2018. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 37297.",

Each defendant's record comprises the\r\nsentencing-related issues corresponding to that particular defendant.\r\nThe 1993 data file (Part 1) includes all appeals cases received by the\r\nUnited States Sentencing Commission as of December 22, 1993, that had\r\ndisposition dates between March 9, 1990, and September 30, 1993\r\n(inclusive).

The\r\nCommission also collected habeas corpus decisions even though they are\r\ntechnically civil matters, because such cases often involve sentencing\r\nissues. Both the \"case\" and the \"defendant\" are used in this\r\ncollection as units of analysis.

Data management\r\nissues with NIBRS are significant, especially when two or more segment\r\nlevels are being merged. These issues require skills separate from\r\ndata analysis. NIBRS data as formatted by the FBI are stored in a\r\nsingle file. These data are organized by various segment levels\r\n(record types). There are six main segment levels: administrative,\r\noffense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment level\r\nhas a different length and layout. There are other segment levels that\r\noccur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significant\r\ncomputing resources are necessary to work with the data in its\r\nsingle-file format. In addition, the user must be sophisticated in\r\nworking with data in complex file types. For these reasons and the\r\ndesire to facilitate the use of NIBRS data, ICPSR created the extract\r\nfiles. The data are not a representative sample of crime in the United\r\nStates.",

The charge-level data may be linked to defendant-level data (extracted from the EOUSA Central System file) through the CS_SEQ variable, and it should be noted that some defendants may not have any charges other than the lead charge appearing on the defendant-level record. The Central Charge and Central System data contain variables from the original EOUSA files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.",

This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries\r\nassociated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to\r\ninclude all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1)\r\nmeasure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the\r\nUnited States, (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal\r\ninjuries over time, (3) identify emerging injury problems, (4)\r\nidentify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular\r\ninjury-related problems, and (5) set national priorities. A\r\nfundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary\r\nsurveillance data are made available in a timely manner to a number of\r\ndifferent federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health\r\nresponsibilities and concerns. Also, the final edited data are\r\nreleased annually as a public use data file for use by other public\r\nhealth professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\n enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\n UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\n program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\n fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\n contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\n comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n \"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\n developed. Using the \"Blueprint\" and in consultation with local and\r\n state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\n for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\n System (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\n data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\n merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\n aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\n data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\n delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\n Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\n motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\n description, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\n Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\n Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\n date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n 1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\n Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\n is contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\n geographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\n Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\n Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\n complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\n general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\n occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\n occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with\r\n UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\n enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\n crime in the United States. For 2001, 21 states and the District of\r\n Columbia, fully or partially participating in NIBRS, were included in\r\nthe dataset.",

Part 10, Group B\r\n Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\n Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\n complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\n general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\n occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\n occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with\r\n UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\n enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\n crime in the United States. For 2001, 21 states and the District of\r\n Columbia, fully or partially participating in NIBRS, were included in\r\nthe dataset.",

-            "description": "The Prosecutor's Management Information System (PROMIS) is\r\na computer-based information system for public prosecution agencies.\r\nPROMIS was initially developed with funds from the United States Law\r\nEnforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) to cope with problems of\r\na large, urban prosecution agency where mass production operations had\r\nsuperseded the traditional practice of a single attorney preparing and\r\nprosecuting a given case from inception to final disposition. The\r\ncombination of massive volumes of cases and assembly-line\r\nfragmentation of responsibility and control had created a situation in\r\nwhich one case was indistinguishable from another and the effects of\r\nproblems at various stages in the assembly line on ultimate case\r\ndisposition went undetected and uncorrected. One unique feature of\r\nPROMIS that addresses these problems is the automated evaluation of\r\ncases. Through the application of a uniform set of criteria, PROMIS\r\nassigns two numerical ratings to each case: one signifying the gravity\r\nof the crimes through the measurement of the amount of harm done to\r\nsociety, and the other signifying the gravity of the prior record of\r\nthe accused. These ratings make it possible to select the more\r\nimportant cases for intensive, pre-trial preparation and to assure\r\neven-handed treatment of cases with similar degrees of gravity. A\r\ncomplementary feature of PROMIS is the automation of reasons for\r\ndecisions made or actions taken along the assembly line. Reasons for\r\ndismissing cases prior to trial on their merits can be related to\r\nearlier cycles of postponement for various reasons and the reasoning\r\nbehind intake and screening decisions. The PROMIS data include\r\ninformation about the defendant, case characteristics and processes,\r\ncharge, sentencing and continuance processes, and the\r\nwitnesses/victims involved in the case. PROMIS was first used in 1971\r\nin the United States Attorney's Office for the District of\r\nColumbia. To enhance the ability to transfer the concepts and software\r\nto other communities, LEAA awarded a grant to the Institute for Law\r\nxand Social Research (INSLAW) in Washington, DC.

The\r\ncombination of massive volumes of cases and assembly-line\r\nfragmentation of responsibility and control had created a situation in\r\nwhich one case was indistinguishable from another and the effects of\r\nproblems at various stages in the assembly line on ultimate case\r\ndisposition went undetected and uncorrected. One unique feature of\r\nPROMIS that addresses these problems is the automated evaluation of\r\ncases. Through the application of a uniform set of criteria, PROMIS\r\nassigns two numerical ratings to each case: one signifying the gravity\r\nof the crimes through the measurement of the amount of harm done to\r\nsociety, and the other signifying the gravity of the prior record of\r\nthe accused. These ratings make it possible to select the more\r\nimportant cases for intensive, pre-trial preparation and to assure\r\neven-handed treatment of cases with similar degrees of gravity. A\r\ncomplementary feature of PROMIS is the automation of reasons for\r\ndecisions made or actions taken along the assembly line. Reasons for\r\ndismissing cases prior to trial on their merits can be related to\r\nearlier cycles of postponement for various reasons and the reasoning\r\nbehind intake and screening decisions. The PROMIS data include\r\ninformation about the defendant, case characteristics and processes,\r\ncharge, sentencing and continuance processes, and the\r\nwitnesses/victims involved in the case. PROMIS was first used in 1971\r\nin the United States Attorney's Office for the District of\r\nColumbia. To enhance the ability to transfer the concepts and software\r\nto other communities, LEAA awarded a grant to the Institute for Law\r\nxand Social Research (INSLAW) in Washington, DC. The Rhode Island\r\nPROMIS data collection is a product of this grant.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\n enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\n UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\n program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\n fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\n contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\n comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n \"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\n developed. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\n state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\n for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\n System (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\n are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\n merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\n aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\n data on the incident, itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\n delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\n Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\n motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\n description, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\n Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\n Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\n date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n 1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\n Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\n is contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\n geographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\n Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\n Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\n complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\n general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\n occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\n occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\n UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\n enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

The database includes conventional social background variables such as the name of the appointing president, the judge's religion, political party affiliation, education, and prior experience. In addition, unique items are provided: the temporal sequence of prior career experiences, the timing of and reason for leaving the bench, gender, race and ethnicity, position numbering analogous to the scheme used for the Supreme Court, American Bar Association rating, and net worth (for judges who began service on the bench after 1978). The second objective of this project was to merge these data with a multi-user database on United States District Court decisions. The database is headed by Donald Songer and funded by the National Science Foundation. It includes a unique identification number for each judge participating in a particular decision. The combined databases should enable scholars to explore: (1) intra- and inter-circuit fluctuation in the distribution of social background characteristics, (2) generational and presidential cohort variation in these attributes, and (3) state and partisan control of seats. The collection also facilitates the construction of models that examine the effects of personal attributes on decision making, while controlling for the conditions above.

The system also\r\nincludes some other types of deaths, namely deaths due to undetermined\r\nintent and unintentional deaths due to firearms. One of the main\r\nreasons for including these types of deaths is that there is overlap\r\nin how these deaths are coded. For example, a particular poisoning\r\ncase may be classified as an undetermined death in one state, but in a\r\nneighboring state, the same case may be coded as a suicide or an\r\nunintentional poisoning. NVDRS is an incident-based system that\r\ncollects data from different data sources, including death\r\ncertificates, coroner and medical examiner records, police reports,\r\ncrime lab data, and child fatality review records. The system collects\r\ndata on a violent incident, the deaths belonging to that incident, the\r\ninjury mechanisms leading to death, and the alleged perpetrators\r\n(suspects) involved in the violent incident. The relationship of the\r\nvictim to the suspect is also recorded, as are the relationships of\r\neach person to the injury mechanisms included. State health\r\ndepartments participating in NVDRS typically identify relevant violent\r\ndeaths as their death certificates are filed and then establish the\r\ndetails of the cases from medical examiner, coroner, and law\r\nenforcement records. Data collection is ongoing as the source\r\ndocuments from the different data providers become available at\r\ndifferent times and intervals. The data represent the violent\r\nincidents that occurred between January and December of that data year\r\nas submitted by the participating states.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually.

ICF International, with the assistance\r\nof BJS, served as the data collection agent.\r\nBJS also conducted surveys of campus law enforcement agencies covering the\r\n1994-95 and 2004-05 school years. The reports produced from these surveys\r\nare available on the BJS Web site and data are available on the ICPSR Web site.",

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails.  In each of the years between the complete censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate\r\nbaseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails.  The 2014 Annual Survey of Jails is the 27th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues.  The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex.  Also new to the survey, data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity.  Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails.\r\nTo address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails.  In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2014.  These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of\r\ncrowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail\r\npopulation.  The data are intended for a variety of users, including\r\nfederal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail\r\nadministrators, researchers, planners, and the public.  The reference date\r\nfor the survey is June 30, 2014.",

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

Since 1979, the Census Bureau has been the NPS data collection agent. The NPS is administered to 51 respondents. Before 2001, the District of Columbia was also a respondent, but responsibility for housing the District of Columbia's sentenced prisoners was transferred to the federal Bureau of Prisons, and by yearend 2001 the District of Columbia no longer operated a prison system. The NPS provides an enumeration of persons in state and federal prisons and collects data on key characteristics of the nation's prison population.

With the 1977 data, the title was expanded to Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data. Each year, participating law enforcement agencies contribute reports to the FBI either directly or through their state reporting programs. ICPSR archives the UCR data as five separate components: (1) summary data, (2) county-level data, (3) incident-level data (National Incident-Based Reporting System [NIBRS]), (4) hate crime data, and (5) various, mostly nonrecurring, data collections. Summary data are reported in four types of files: (a) Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, (b) Property Stolen and Recovered, (c) Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), and (d) Police Employee (LEOKA) Data (Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted). The county-level data provide counts of arrests and offenses aggregated to the county level. County populations are also reported. In the late 1970s, new ways to look at crime were studied. The UCR program was subsequently expanded to capture incident-level data with the implementation of the National Incident-Based Reporting System. The NIBRS data focus on various aspects of a crime incident. The gathering of hate crime data by the UCR program was begun in 1990. Hate crimes are defined as crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In September 1994, disabilities, both physical and mental, were added to the list. The fifth component of ICPSR's UCR holdings is comprised of various collections, many of which are nonrecurring and prepared by individual researchers. These collections go beyond the scope of the standard UCR collections provided by the FBI, either by including data for a range of years or by focusing on other aspects of analysis.\r\nNACJD has produced resource guides on UCR and on\u00a0NIBRS\u00a0data.\r\n\r\n\u00a0",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nprovided its support, formulating a comprehensive redesign\r\neffort. Following a multiyear study and in consultation with local\r\nand state law enforcement executives, new guidelines for the Uniform\r\nCrime Reports were created. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\ndata are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. The Batch Header Segment (Parts 1-3)\r\nseparates and identifies individual police agencies by Originating\r\nAgency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which is contained\r\non three records for each ORI, includes agency name, geographic\r\nlocation, and population of the area. Part 4, Administrative Segment,\r\noffers data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime\r\nincident is delineated by one administrative segment record. Also\r\nprovided are Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon\r\nuse, and bias motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property\r\nloss, property description, property value, drug type and quantity),\r\nPart 7, Victim Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries),\r\nPart 8, Offender Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee\r\nSegment (arrest date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). Part 10, Group\r\nB Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B\r\ncrimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for\r\nwhich the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the\r\nFBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the\r\nincident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the\r\nincident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS\r\nreporting. As with UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the\r\npart of law enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative\r\nsample of crime in the United States. For 1998, 17 states, fully or\r\npartially participating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.",
