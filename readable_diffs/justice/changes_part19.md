The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\nThis project sought to study the District Attorney of New York's (DANY) current practices by addressing the complex relationship between prosecutorial decision making and racial and ethnic justice in felony and misdemeanor cases closed in New York County in 2010-2011. Using a mixed-methods approach, administrative records from the DANY case-management systems and prosecutorial interviews were examined to study case acceptance for prosecution, pretrial detention and bail determination, case dismissal, plea offers, and sentencing. Researchers developed five hypotheses for the data collected: \r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to have their cases accepted for prosecution than similarly situated white defendants.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to be held in pretrial detention and less likely to be released on bail.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are less likely to have cases dismissed.\r\n Blacks and Latinos are less likely to receive a plea offer to a lesser charge and more likely to receive custodial sentence offers. \r\n Blacks and Latinos are more likely to be sentenced to custodial punishments.\r\nAll criminal activity of the defendant was examined, as well as their demographics and prior history, the location of the crime. Information on the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) was examined as well, including their demographics and caseload in order to more thoroughly understand the catalysts and trends in decision making.",

-            "description": "The current study focused on 479 men and women from South Carolina who were enrolled as participants in the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) multi-site program evaluation shortly before prison release in 2004 or 2005. The original SVORI data suggested that the South Carolina respondents were similar to the multi-site sample with \"committed to not going back to prison\" as the most common reason for desisting and using drugs or alcohol as the most common reason for persisting. The goals of the current study were to (1) update information on the current status of these individuals across multiple domains (e.g., housing, employment, substance use); (2) gather additional administrative recidivism data to examine long-term offending; and (3) acquire information about the factors individuals associated with their decisions to desist from criminal activity, as well as circumstances associated with renewed criminal activity or desistence. Interviews were conducted with those that the study team were able to locate and additional administrative arrest and incarceration data were acquired for the full sample, providing recidivism follow-up over at least a 10-year period.\r\nOfficial administrative data were obtained from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (rearrests) and South Carolina Department of Corrections (reincarcerations). Arrest data span the entire arrest history (from first arrest through December 2015); reincarceration data span the period between the SVORI study prison release in 2005 and 2006 through June 2014. These data were obtained for the full sample of 479 South Carolina SVORI participants.\r\nThree components of interview data were collected.\r\nDesistance study interview data: 1 wave of in-person interviews was conducted with 208 study subjects who consented to participate in an interview. The research team used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) to administer the survey, and interviews were conducted from September 2016 through March 2017.\r\nLife event data: The Life Events Calendar (LEC) is a tool used in qualitative and quantitative research to gather retrospective information about a person's life, experiences, and history. The approach is based on autobiographical memory and how entering events on a calendar or page help facilitate memory recall. LECs typically encompass periods of 5 years or less; this study's LEC covered a 10- to 12-year span to allow analysis since last contact with the study cohort. Data were collected from the 208 subjects who consented to be interviewed.\r\nSVORI interview data: This inventory includes files with select baseline and outcome data (e.g., self-reported employment, drug use, criminal behavior) for desistance study subjects who responded to follow-up interviews at Wave 2 (3-month), Wave 3 (9-month), and Wave 4 (15-month).\r\nThis collection of administrative and interview data is organized into 14 data parts. Demographic data includes information on age, gender, race, and education.",

+            "description": "The current study focused on 479 men and women from South Carolina who were enrolled as participants in the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) multi-site program evaluation shortly before prison release in 2004 or 2005. The original SVORI data suggested that the South Carolina respondents were similar to the multi-site sample with \"committed to not going back to prison\" as the most common reason for desisting and using drugs or alcohol as the most common reason for persisting. The goals of the current study were to (1) update information on the current status of these individuals across multiple domains (e.g., housing, employment, substance use); (2) gather additional administrative recidivism data to examine long-term offending; and (3) acquire information about the factors individuals associated with their decisions to desist from criminal activity, as well as circumstances associated with renewed criminal activity or desistence. Interviews were conducted with those that the study team were able to locate and additional administrative arrest and incarceration data were acquired for the full sample, providing recidivism follow-up over at least a 10-year period.\r\nOfficial administrative data were obtained from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (rearrests) and South Carolina Department of Corrections (reincarcerations). Arrest data span the entire arrest history (from first arrest through December 2015); reincarceration data span the period between the SVORI study prison release in 2005 and 2006 through June 2014. These data were obtained for the full sample of 479 South Carolina SVORI participants.\r\nThree components of interview data were collected.\r\nDesistance study interview data: 1 wave of in-person interviews was conducted with 208 study subjects who consented to participate in an interview. The research team used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) to administer the survey, and interviews were conducted from September 2016 through March 2017.\r\nLife event data: The Life Events Calendar (LEC) is a tool used in qualitative and quantitative research to gather retrospective information about a person's life, experiences, and history. The approach is based on autobiographical memory and how entering events on a calendar or page help facilitate memory recall. LECs typically encompass periods of 5 years or less; this study's LEC covered a 10- to 12-year span to allow analysis since last contact with the study cohort. Data were collected from the 208 subjects who consented to be interviewed.\r\nSVORI interview data: This inventory includes files with select baseline and outcome data (e.g., self-reported employment, drug use, criminal behavior) for desistance study subjects who responded to follow-up interviews at Wave 2 (3-month), Wave 3 (9-month), and Wave 4 (15-month).\r\nThis collection of administrative and interview data is organized into 14 data parts. Demographic data includes information on age, gender, race, and education.",

Previous research has established a \"status quo\" for risk assessments.\r\nThis study was set within the context of the developing sexual offender risk prediction field, where investigators explored reliable and valid means to assess what have been termed \"dynamic risk factors.\"  Instruments that identify the specific psychological risk factors present in the individual offender ought to allow treatment for that individual to be tailored to these specific needs, thus increasing its effectiveness. Thus, instruments have been designed to: \r\n\r\n Assess psychological factors that are empirically related to sexual recidivism, thus creating a basis for selecting treatment targets \r\n Show robust incremental predictive validity relative to Static-99R or other measures of static risk factors \r\n Measure change in a way that is convincingly related to sexual recidivism \r\n Incorporate and point risk managers towards some of the factors identified in the desistance literature \r\n Improve the effectiveness of treatment in reducing sexual recidivism \r\n\r\n Enrollment of sex offenders in the evaluation study began in April 2013. To be included, offenders needed to be Static-99R eligible (an adult male convicted of a contact or non-contact sex offense with an identifiable victim), mentally cognizant, released to community supervision, and at least 18 years old in January 2013 in Maricopa County and April 2013 in New York City.

Previous research has established a \"status quo\" for risk assessments.\r\nThis study was set within the context of the developing sexual offender risk prediction field, where investigators explored reliable and valid means to assess what have been termed \"dynamic risk factors.\"  Instruments that identify the specific psychological risk factors present in the individual offender ought to allow treatment for that individual to be tailored to these specific needs, thus increasing its effectiveness. Thus, instruments have been designed to: \r\n\r\n Assess psychological factors that are empirically related to sexual recidivism, thus creating a basis for selecting treatment targets \r\n Show robust incremental predictive validity relative to Static-99R or other measures of static risk factors \r\n Measure change in a way that is convincingly related to sexual recidivism \r\n Incorporate and point risk managers towards some of the factors identified in the desistance literature \r\n Improve the effectiveness of treatment in reducing sexual recidivism \r\n\r\n Enrollment of sex offenders in the evaluation study began in April 2013. To be included, offenders needed to be Static-99R eligible (an adult male convicted of a contact or non-contact sex offense with an identifiable victim), mentally cognizant, released to community supervision, and at least 18 years old in January 2013 in Maricopa County and April 2013 in New York City.

-            "description": "This study was designed to analyze the impact of four\r\n televised public service announcements (PSAs) aired for three months\r\n in Lima, Ohio. The researchers sought to answer three specific\r\n research questions: (1) Were the PSAs effective in transferring\r\n knowledge to citizens about the police? (2) Did the PSAs have an\r\n impact on resident satisfaction with the police? and (3) Did the PSAs\r\n have an impact on the behavior of citizens interacting with the\r\n police? To assess public attitudes about the Lima police and to\r\n determine whether the substance of the PSAs was being communicated to\r\n the residents of Lima, three waves of telephone interviews were\r\n conducted (Part 1). The first telephone interviews were conducted in\r\n April 1996 with approximately 500 randomly selected Lima\r\n residents. These were baseline interviews that took place before the\r\n PSAs aired. The survey instrument used in the first interview assessed\r\n resident satisfaction with the police and the services they\r\n provided. After completion of the Wave 1 interviews, the PSAs were\r\n aired on television for three months (June 5-August 28, 1996). After\r\n August 28, the PSAs were removed from general circulation. A second\r\n wave of telephone interviews was conducted in September 1996 with a\r\n different group of randomly selected Lima residents. The same survey\r\n instrument used during the first interviews was administered during\r\n the second wave, with additional questions added relating to whether\r\n the respondent saw any of the PSAs. A third group of randomly selected\r\n Lima residents was contacted via the telephone in January 1997 for the\r\n final wave of interviews. The final interviews utilized the identical\r\n survey instrument used during Wave 2. The focus of this follow-up\r\n survey was on citizen retention, over time, of the information\r\n communicated in the PSAs. Official data collected from computerized\r\n records maintained by the Lima Police Department were also collected\r\n to monitor changes in citizen behavior (Part 2). The records data span\r\n 127 weeks, from January 1, 1995, to June 7, 1997, which includes 74\r\n weeks of pre-PSA data and 53 weeks of data for the period during the\r\n initial airing of the first PSA and thereafter. Variables in Part 1\r\n include whether respondents were interested in learning about what to\r\n do if stopped by the police, what actions they had displayed when\r\n stopped by the police, if they would defend another person being\r\n treated unfairly by the police, how responsible they felt (as a\r\n citizen) in preventing crimes, the likelihood of calling the police if\r\n they were aware of a crime, perception of crime and fear of crime, and\r\n whether there had been an increase or decrease in the level of crime\r\n in their neighborhoods. Respondents were also asked about the amount\r\n of television they watched, whether they saw any of the public service\r\n announcements and if so to rate them, whether the PSAs provided\r\n information not already known, whether any of the PSA topics had come\r\n up in conversations with family or friends, and whether the\r\n respondent would like to see more PSAs in the future. Finally,\r\n respondents were asked whether the police were doing as much as they\r\n could to make the neighborhood safe, how responsive the police were to\r\n nonemergency matters, and to rate their overall satisfaction with the\r\n Lima Police Department and its various services. Demographic variables\r\n for Part 1 include the race, gender, age, marital status, level of\r\n education, employment status, and income level of each respondent.\r\n Variables in Part 2 cover police use-of-force or resisting arrest\r\n incidents that took place during the study period, whether the PSA\r\n aired during the week in which a use-of-force or resisting arrest\r\n incident took place, the number of supplemental police use-of-force\r\n reports that were made, and the number of resisting arrest charges\r\nmade.",

+            "description": "This study was designed to analyze the impact of four\r\n televised public service announcements (PSAs) aired for three months\r\n in Lima, Ohio. The researchers sought to answer three specific\r\n research questions: (1) Were the PSAs effective in transferring\r\n knowledge to citizens about the police? (2) Did the PSAs have an\r\n impact on resident satisfaction with the police? and (3) Did the PSAs\r\n have an impact on the behavior of citizens interacting with the\r\n police? To assess public attitudes about the Lima police and to\r\n determine whether the substance of the PSAs was being communicated to\r\n the residents of Lima, three waves of telephone interviews were\r\n conducted (Part 1). The first telephone interviews were conducted in\r\n April 1996 with approximately 500 randomly selected Lima\r\n residents. These were baseline interviews that took place before the\r\n PSAs aired. The survey instrument used in the first interview assessed\r\n resident satisfaction with the police and the services they\r\n provided. After completion of the Wave 1 interviews, the PSAs were\r\n aired on television for three months (June 5-August 28, 1996). After\r\n August 28, the PSAs were removed from general circulation. A second\r\n wave of telephone interviews was conducted in September 1996 with a\r\n different group of randomly selected Lima residents. The same survey\r\n instrument used during the first interviews was administered during\r\n the second wave, with additional questions added relating to whether\r\n the respondent saw any of the PSAs. A third group of randomly selected\r\n Lima residents was contacted via the telephone in January 1997 for the\r\n final wave of interviews. The final interviews utilized the identical\r\n survey instrument used during Wave 2. The focus of this follow-up\r\n survey was on citizen retention, over time, of the information\r\n communicated in the PSAs. Official data collected from computerized\r\n records maintained by the Lima Police Department were also collected\r\n to monitor changes in citizen behavior (Part 2). The records data span\r\n 127 weeks, from January 1, 1995, to June 7, 1997, which includes 74\r\n weeks of pre-PSA data and 53 weeks of data for the period during the\r\n initial airing of the first PSA and thereafter. Variables in Part 1\r\n include whether respondents were interested in learning about what to\r\n do if stopped by the police, what actions they had displayed when\r\n stopped by the police, if they would defend another person being\r\n treated unfairly by the police, how responsible they felt (as a\r\n citizen) in preventing crimes, the likelihood of calling the police if\r\n they were aware of a crime, perception of crime and fear of crime, and\r\n whether there had been an increase or decrease in the level of crime\r\n in their neighborhoods. Respondents were also asked about the amount\r\n of television they watched, whether they saw any of the public service\r\n announcements and if so to rate them, whether the PSAs provided\r\n information not already known, whether any of the PSA topics had come\r\n up in conversations with family or friends, and whether the\r\n respondent would like to see more PSAs in the future. Finally,\r\n respondents were asked whether the police were doing as much as they\r\n could to make the neighborhood safe, how responsive the police were to\r\n nonemergency matters, and to rate their overall satisfaction with the\r\n Lima Police Department and its various services. Demographic variables\r\n for Part 1 include the race, gender, age, marital status, level of\r\n education, employment status, and income level of each respondent.\r\n Variables in Part 2 cover police use-of-force or resisting arrest\r\n incidents that took place during the study period, whether the PSA\r\n aired during the week in which a use-of-force or resisting arrest\r\n incident took place, the number of supplemental police use-of-force\r\n reports that were made, and the number of resisting arrest charges\r\nmade.",

Maxey Boys Training School\r\n in Michigan. The purposes of the evaluation were to describe the\r\n activities of the RSAT program and the relationship between program\r\n participants and success in the new program. There were five primary\r\n evaluation questions: (1) Were the participants appropriate? (2) Was\r\n the staff trained to deliver the planned services? (3) How did service\r\n delivery vary over time? (4) Did the participants make timely\r\n progress? and (5) What organizational factors changed service delivery\r\n and participant progress? Residents were admitted to the RSAT program\r\n and its comparison group on the basis of three criteria: (1) the\r\n resident was not a sex offender, (2) he had a known substance abuse\r\n history, and (3) he was expected to be released within one year. Youth\r\n in the RSAT program underwent intensive substance abuse\r\n psycho-education and relapse prevention in addition to the treatment\r\n provided in the Maxey Model. Intake data from the Family Independence\r\n Agency Information System (Part 1) were gathered for youths who\r\n entered Maxey between 1995 and 1998. These data were used to determine\r\n if significant differences existed between the RSAT and comparison\r\n groups. Additional data were collected through a client survey (Parts\r\n 2 and 3), which included questions that evaluated youth satisfaction\r\n with services and their predictions for success. Variables in Part 1\r\n include program admission date, whether the youth was a sex offender,\r\n substance abuse history, the group and wing to which the youth\r\n belonged, age of first offense, age of admission to Maxey, offense\r\n class, number of arrests, number of previous placements, number of\r\n truancies, legal status, and date of first and second\r\n offense. Demographic variables include race, age, marital status, and\r\n county. Variables in Parts 2 and 3 assess the youth's opinions about\r\n school, food, group sessions, hall staff, family sessions, family\r\n visits, the overall program at Maxey, teachers, police, and\r\n judges. Additional variables include last grade of school completed,\r\n expected educational goal upon leaving Maxey, family substance abuse\r\nhistory, and prevalence of substance abuse in neighborhood.",

-            "description": "The goal for this study was to conduct a process evaluation\r\n of the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program, called\r\n the Genesis program, at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility\r\n (SNMCD) by examining the program's structure and assessing its\r\n intermediate impact upon participating inmates. The study focuses on\r\n answering three research questions: (1) Who were the program\r\n participants? (2) What were the characteristics of the program? (3)\r\n Was the program reaching the most appropriate offenders, or were its\r\n participants primarily offenders who were not likely to become\r\n recidivists? The study contains information on every inmate who\r\n entered the Genesis program from July 31, 1997, to July 31, 1998. For\r\n evaluation purposes, the researchers designed their own data\r\n collection form which they used to collect relevant information from\r\n each participant's treatment program file. Each participant's file was\r\n maintained by Genesis program staff and was kept for the duration each\r\n inmate was in the program. From each program participant at intake,\r\n using the data collection instrument, the researchers collected\r\n demographic information, substance abuse history, and criminal\r\n history. The data are provided in two parts. Both parts are from the\r\n same data collection instrument. Part 1 covers Questions 1 through 15\r\n of the data collection instrument, while Part 2 covers Questions 16\r\n through 34 of the data collection instrument. Part 1 includes\r\n demographic variables about the inmate such as birth date, age,\r\n ethnicity, citizenship, years of education, prior employment status,\r\n longest employment, and average weekly income. It also includes\r\n incarceration information such as confinement date, length of current\r\n sentence, RSAT admission date, and expected parole date, and criminal\r\n history information such as age at first adult arrest, number of\r\n juvenile arrests, number of adult arrests, date of first adult arrest,\r\n date of last adult arrest, and number of years served in prison.\r\n There are also variables to address the inmate's drug use history as a\r\n juvenile and as an adult. Part 2 continues with the drug use history\r\n of the inmate as an adult with information about drugs used by IV\r\n injection, number of alcohol withdrawals, number of drug overdoses,\r\n number of detoxes, inpatient treatment received, outpatient treatment\r\n received, average amount of money spent on drugs, percentage of income\r\n spent on drugs, number of family members who use alcohol or drugs, and\r\n how they were related to the inmate. In addition, the file contains\r\n demographic information, such as current marital status and number of\r\n children, and the inmate's psychological history including depression,\r\n anxiety, anger, trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering,\r\n attempted suicide, prescribed medication, and hospitalization.\r\n Criminal career variables include length of criminal career, all past\r\n charges, weapons used during any crime, number of times a weapon was\r\nused, and total number of convictions.",

The study focuses on\r\n answering three research questions: (1) Who were the program\r\n participants? (2) What were the characteristics of the program? (3)\r\n Was the program reaching the most appropriate offenders, or were its\r\n participants primarily offenders who were not likely to become\r\n recidivists? The study contains information on every inmate who\r\n entered the Genesis program from July 31, 1997, to July 31, 1998. For\r\n evaluation purposes, the researchers designed their own data\r\n collection form which they used to collect relevant information from\r\n each participant's treatment program file. Each participant's file was\r\n maintained by Genesis program staff and was kept for the duration each\r\n inmate was in the program. From each program participant at intake,\r\n using the data collection instrument, the researchers collected\r\n demographic information, substance abuse history, and criminal\r\n history. The data are provided in two parts. Both parts are from the\r\n same data collection instrument. Part 1 covers Questions 1 through 15\r\n of the data collection instrument, while Part 2 covers Questions 16\r\n through 34 of the data collection instrument. Part 1 includes\r\n demographic variables about the inmate such as birth date, age,\r\n ethnicity, citizenship, years of education, prior employment status,\r\n longest employment, and average weekly income. It also includes\r\n incarceration information such as confinement date, length of current\r\n sentence, RSAT admission date, and expected parole date, and criminal\r\n history information such as age at first adult arrest, number of\r\n juvenile arrests, number of adult arrests, date of first adult arrest,\r\n date of last adult arrest, and number of years served in prison.\r\n There are also variables to address the inmate's drug use history as a\r\n juvenile and as an adult. Part 2 continues with the drug use history\r\n of the inmate as an adult with information about drugs used by IV\r\n injection, number of alcohol withdrawals, number of drug overdoses,\r\n number of detoxes, inpatient treatment received, outpatient treatment\r\n received, average amount of money spent on drugs, percentage of income\r\n spent on drugs, number of family members who use alcohol or drugs, and\r\n how they were related to the inmate. In addition, the file contains\r\n demographic information, such as current marital status and number of\r\n children, and the inmate's psychological history including depression,\r\n anxiety, anger, trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering,\r\n attempted suicide, prescribed medication, and hospitalization.\r\n Criminal career variables include length of criminal career, all past\r\n charges, weapons used during any crime, number of times a weapon was\r\nused, and total number of convictions.",

Per the terms of their grant, the researchers selected cases\r\n that were handled under the revised Death Penalty Protocol of 1995 and\r\n were processed during Attorney General Janet Reno's term in office.\r\n The researchers began the project by examining a sample of Department\r\n of Justice Capital Case Unit (CCU) case files. These files contained\r\n documents submitted by the United States Attorney's Office (USAO), a\r\n copy of the indictment, a copy of the Attorney General's Review\r\n Committee on Capital Cases (AGRC's) draft and final memorandum to the\r\n Attorney General (AG), and a copy of the AG's decision letter. Next,\r\n they created a list of the types of data that would be feasible and\r\n desirable to collect and constructed a case abstraction form and\r\n coding rules for recording data on victims, defendants, and case\r\n characteristics from the CCU's hard-copy case files. The record\r\n abstractors did not have access to information about defendant or\r\n victim gender or race. Victim and defendant race and gender data were\r\n obtained from the CCU's electronic files. Five specially trained\r\n coders used the case abstraction forms to record and enter salient\r\n information in the CCU hard-copy files into a database. Coders worked\r\n on only one case at a time. The resulting database contains 312 cases\r\n for which defendant- and victim-race data were available for the 94\r\n federal judicial districts. These cases were received by the CCU\r\n between January 1, 1995 and July 31, 2000, and for which the AG at the\r\n time had made a decision about whether to seek the death penalty prior\r\n to December 31, 2000. The 312 cases includes a total of 652 defendants\r\n (see SAMPLING for cases not included). The AG made a seek/not-seek\r\n decision for 600 of the defendants, with the difference between the\r\n counts stemming mainly from defendants pleading guilty prior to the AG\r\n making a charging decision. The database was structured to allow\r\n researchers to examine two stages in the federal prosecution process,\r\n namely the USAO recommendation to seek or not to seek the death\r\n penalty and the final AG charging decision. Finally, dispositions\r\n (e.g., sentence imposed) were obtained for all but 12 of the\r\n defendants in the database. Variables include data about the\r\n defendants and victims such as age, gender, race/ethnicity,\r\n employment, education, marital status, and the relationship between\r\n the defendant and victim.

-            "description": "This study addressed questions related to potential geographic and racial disparity in the investigation and prosecution of federal capital cases and examined the process by which criminal cases, specially homicide cases, enter the federal criminal justice system. The primary method of data collection used was face-to-face interviews of key criminal justice officials within each district included in the study. Between 2000 and 2004, the researchers visited nine federal districts and interviewed all actors in the state and federal criminal justice systems who potentially would play a role in determining whether a homicide case was investigated and prosecuted in the state or federal systems. The study focused on homicide cases because federal homicides represented the offense of conviction in all capital case convictions in the federal system under the 2000 and 2001 DOJ reports (see U.S. Department of Justice, \"The Federal Death Penalty System: A Statistical Survey (1988-2000),\" Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, September 12, 2000, and U.S. Department of Justice, \"The Federal Death Penalty System: Supplementary Data, Analysis and Revised Protocols for Capital Case Review,\" Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, June 6, 2001). In addition, federally related homicides are frequently involved with drug, gang, and/or organized crime investigations. Using 11 standardized interview protocols, developed in consultation with members of the project's advisory group, research staff interviewed local investigative agencies (police chief or his/her representative, section heads for homicide, drug, gang, or organized crime units as applicable to the agency structure), federal investigative agencies (Special Agent-in-Charge or designee, section heads of relevant units), local prosecutors (District Attorney, Assistant District Attorney, including the line attorneys and section heads), and defense attorneys who practiced in federal court. Due to the extensive number of issues to be covered with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, interviews were conducted with: (1) the U.S. Attorney or designated representative, (2) section heads, and (3) Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) within the respective sections. Because the U.S. Attorneys were appointed following the change in the U.S. Presidency in 2000, a slightly altered U.S. Attorney questionnaire was designed for interviews with the former U.S. Attorney who was in office during the study period of 1995 through 2000. In some instances, because the project focus was on issues and processes from 1995 through 2000, a second individual with longer tenure was chosen to be interviewed simultaneously when the head or section head was newer to the position. In some instances when a key respondent was unavailable during the site visit and no acceptable alternative could be identified, arrangements were made to complete the interview by telephone after the visit. The interviews included questions related to the nature of the local crime problem, agency crime priorities, perceived benefits of the federal over the local process, local and federal resources, nature and target of joint task forces, relationships between and among agencies, policy and agreements, definitions and understanding of federal jurisdiction, federal investigative strategies, case flow, and attitudes toward the death penalty.",

The primary method of data collection used was face-to-face interviews of key criminal justice officials within each district included in the study. Between 2000 and 2004, the researchers visited nine federal districts and interviewed all actors in the state and federal criminal justice systems who potentially would play a role in determining whether a homicide case was investigated and prosecuted in the state or federal systems. The study focused on homicide cases because federal homicides represented the offense of conviction in all capital case convictions in the federal system under the 2000 and 2001 DOJ reports (see U.S. Department of Justice, \"The Federal Death Penalty System: A Statistical Survey (1988-2000),\" Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, September 12, 2000, and U.S. Department of Justice, \"The Federal Death Penalty System: Supplementary Data, Analysis and Revised Protocols for Capital Case Review,\" Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice, June 6, 2001). In addition, federally related homicides are frequently involved with drug, gang, and/or organized crime investigations. Using 11 standardized interview protocols, developed in consultation with members of the project's advisory group, research staff interviewed local investigative agencies (police chief or his/her representative, section heads for homicide, drug, gang, or organized crime units as applicable to the agency structure), federal investigative agencies (Special Agent-in-Charge or designee, section heads of relevant units), local prosecutors (District Attorney, Assistant District Attorney, including the line attorneys and section heads), and defense attorneys who practiced in federal court. Due to the extensive number of issues to be covered with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, interviews were conducted with: (1) the U.S. Attorney or designated representative, (2) section heads, and (3) Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) within the respective sections. Because the U.S. Attorneys were appointed following the change in the U.S. Presidency in 2000, a slightly altered U.S. Attorney questionnaire was designed for interviews with the former U.S. Attorney who was in office during the study period of 1995 through 2000. In some instances, because the project focus was on issues and processes from 1995 through 2000, a second individual with longer tenure was chosen to be interviewed simultaneously when the head or section head was newer to the position. In some instances when a key respondent was unavailable during the site visit and no acceptable alternative could be identified, arrangements were made to complete the interview by telephone after the visit. The interviews included questions related to the nature of the local crime problem, agency crime priorities, perceived benefits of the federal over the local process, local and federal resources, nature and target of joint task forces, relationships between and among agencies, policy and agreements, definitions and understanding of federal jurisdiction, federal investigative strategies, case flow, and attitudes toward the death penalty.",

-            "description": "Despite much recent attention devoted to understanding the ramifications of residential mobility, especially negative consequences for youth, there is scant research exploring how inner-city mobility impacts youth violence and victimization among minorities and immigrants. Leaving the city imparts benefits: decreasing deviance and improving youth outcomes. Considering that many are unable to \"escape\" the city, clarifying what effects, if any, inner-city mobility has is critical. Destination neighborhoods for youth who move in the city are either contextually the same, better, or worse than their original neighborhood. Evidence suggests that immigrant families are more likely to move as are racial minorities. Because of this, the researchers examined the extent to which moving within a city affects minority and immigrant youth experiences, particularly in relation to changes in neighborhood collective efficacy; a major characteristic shaping community crime rates and youth violence.\r\nThis project involved four main goals:\r\n\r\nidentify key characteristics of the destination neighborhoods and those who are moving within the city of Chicago;\r\nunderstand how inner-city mobility of minority and immigrant youth affects engagement in violence and victimization;\r\ndetermine whether vertical or horizontal mobility with respect to key neighborhood factors differentially influences minority and immigrant youth outcomes;\r\nassess who fares better - youth who vertically move (to better or worse neighborhoods), those who do not move, or those who horizontally move (to equivalent neighborhoods).\r\nThis research used data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Data were drawn from both the Longitudinal Cohort Study (N=1,611) and Community Survey (N=97). The rich data from the Community Survey affords the opportunity to examine how community\r\ncharacteristics like collective efficacy, disorder, and indicators of social\r\ndisorganization can impact a variety of youth behaviors among at-risk youth\r\nover time between Wave 1 and Wave 2 and Wave 2 and Wave 3. The Longitudinal\r\nCohort Study provides data on youth characteristics and experiences with\r\nviolence, and ecological information on family and peer relationships. The investigators focused primarily on three of the seven youth cohorts from the Longitudinal Cohort Study: 9, 12, and 15. The ages of these youth during the study period place them at increased risk for exposure to community violence, and place them in range for aging into, peaking, or aging out of crime and delinquency.\r\nThe Longitudinal Cohort Study respondents are nested in neighborhood clusters and multilevel models are employed to assess the outcomes victimization and violence within neighborhood context. The researchers employed a series of hierarchical generalized linear models using HLM 7 in addition to running several analyses of variance (ANOVA) permitting examinations between groups of interest.",

Leaving the city imparts benefits: decreasing deviance and improving youth outcomes. Considering that many are unable to \"escape\" the city, clarifying what effects, if any, inner-city mobility has is critical. Destination neighborhoods for youth who move in the city are either contextually the same, better, or worse than their original neighborhood. Evidence suggests that immigrant families are more likely to move as are racial minorities. Because of this, the researchers examined the extent to which moving within a city affects minority and immigrant youth experiences, particularly in relation to changes in neighborhood collective efficacy; a major characteristic shaping community crime rates and youth violence.\r\nThis project involved four main goals:\r\n\r\nidentify key characteristics of the destination neighborhoods and those who are moving within the city of Chicago;\r\nunderstand how inner-city mobility of minority and immigrant youth affects engagement in violence and victimization;\r\ndetermine whether vertical or horizontal mobility with respect to key neighborhood factors differentially influences minority and immigrant youth outcomes;\r\nassess who fares better - youth who vertically move (to better or worse neighborhoods), those who do not move, or those who horizontally move (to equivalent neighborhoods).\r\nThis research used data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Data were drawn from both the Longitudinal Cohort Study (N=1,611) and Community Survey (N=97). The rich data from the Community Survey affords the opportunity to examine how community\r\ncharacteristics like collective efficacy, disorder, and indicators of social\r\ndisorganization can impact a variety of youth behaviors among at-risk youth\r\nover time between Wave 1 and Wave 2 and Wave 2 and Wave 3. The Longitudinal\r\nCohort Study provides data on youth characteristics and experiences with\r\nviolence, and ecological information on family and peer relationships. The investigators focused primarily on three of the seven youth cohorts from the Longitudinal Cohort Study: 9, 12, and 15. The ages of these youth during the study period place them at increased risk for exposure to community violence, and place them in range for aging into, peaking, or aging out of crime and delinquency.\r\nThe Longitudinal Cohort Study respondents are nested in neighborhood clusters and multilevel models are employed to assess the outcomes victimization and violence within neighborhood context. The researchers employed a series of hierarchical generalized linear models using HLM 7 in addition to running several analyses of variance (ANOVA) permitting examinations between groups of interest.",

Survey data come from the districts' SROs, and a sample of teachers, school leaders, students, and parents. Survey data was collected between spring of 2017 and fall of 2017.",

Somalia has endured one of the longest and most brutal wars of the past 30 years. This enduring conflict has led to millions of Somalis being dispersed as refugees across the globe. As refugees with limited resources, many Somalis in North America are resettled in poor urban neighborhoods where they are visibly different, not only because of race or ethnicity but also because of dress, especially for women who wear a Muslim head covering.\r\nIn addition, the community has been plagued by violence. While the number of Somali American youth joining these groups are small and while the majority of Somali Americans are law-abiding citizens, the terrorist groups' ability to recruit these youth and to convince some of them to engage in violent acts is concerning, not only to policymakers and law enforcement, but also to the Somali community, which fears losing more youth to violence or having the community's reputation sullied by being associated with terrorism.\r\nWhile some of the social and cultural factors affecting Somalis are unique to that ethnic group, they also share experiences common to many immigrants, navigating identity development and duality as they move between home and host cultures, contending with discrimination as religious, racial and ethnic minorities, and striving to achieve their dreams while struggling to gain socioeconomic stability. Thus, understanding their developmental trajectories may inform the understanding of other immigrant and refugee groups as well.\r\n No valid and reliable measurement for risk for violent extremism exists; there is no single profile or set of risk factors that can accurately determine who is most at risk for engaging in violent extremist acts. The study did not attempt to determine who is most at risk. Rather, the researchers sought to identify broad attitudes that would indicate a general openness to, or rejection of, the use of violence or illegal actions in support of a political cause. \r\n The qualitative interviews feature experiences of formal (e.g. police) and informal (e.g. community) institutions over the past year. Examples of interview prompts include questions related to social bonds with family and community, and interactions with police.",

It also sought to draw lessons learned that other\r\njurisdictions can use to begin this work or increase their capacity and\r\neffectiveness, regardless of size or location. This project was a partnership\r\nbetween the Justice Research and Statistics Association (JRSA) and the National\r\nDistrict Attorney's Association (NDAA) and consisted of two phases. Phase I was\r\na national survey of prosecutors and Phase II was a series of four case studies\r\nin jurisdictions undertaking anti-TIP initiatives.\r\nThe results of the\r\nsurvey are intended to provide a national snapshot of trends in local TIP\r\nprosecutions and the use of state-level TIP statutes by local prosecutors. It\r\nserves as a ten-year update to, and expansion of, previous research on local prosecutorial\r\napproaches to trafficking that had used data on cases prosecuted through 2008.",

It also sought to draw lessons learned that other\r\njurisdictions can use to begin this work or increase their capacity and\r\neffectiveness, regardless of size or location. This project was a partnership\r\nbetween the Justice Research and Statistics Association (JRSA) and the National\r\nDistrict Attorney's Association (NDAA) and consisted of two phases. Phase I was\r\na national survey of prosecutors and Phase II was a series of four case studies\r\nin jurisdictions undertaking anti-TIP initiatives.\r\nThe results of the\r\nsurvey are intended to provide a national snapshot of trends in local TIP\r\nprosecutions and the use of state-level TIP statutes by local prosecutors. It\r\nserves as a ten-year update to, and expansion of, previous research on local prosecutorial\r\napproaches to trafficking that had used data on cases prosecuted through 2008.",

GCF was implemented in two private high schools in Maryland during spring of 2019. Although the study was designed as a quasi-experimental research with pre/post testing of treatment and control groups, implementation challenges resulted in design problems and a small sample, allowing only for exploratory study. The preliminary results suggest that GCF is associated with some statistically significant gains in participants' knowledge and attitude. The study also presents team's qualitative findings as well as GCF replication framework and financial cost analysis. An assessment of the GCF implementation experience and related observations indicates that GCF may be difficult to replicate due to community sensitivities about accepting the violent extremism threat and the ability of service providers to teach the GCF curriculum.

To assess if the training was effective, researchers conducted an outcome evaluation using a mixed methods approach, including quantitative pre-post training and qualitative interviews with instructors and students. The evaluation had three main components: 1) to assess training completion, including the percentage of students who completed the training and the factors that contributed to their completion; 2) to ascertain whether students attained knowledge through pre-test/post-tests and the factors that contributed to knowledge attainment; and 3) to determine whether students retained their knowledge using a post-training exam approximately three months following the training, and whether the students incorporated the core concepts of the training into their SAFE practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researchers divided the project into 3 studies.\r\nStudy 1 examined how many students completed the training and what predicted training completion.\r\nStudy 2a utilized a one-group pre-test post-test design where researchers assessed students' knowledge attainment for 12 online modules.\r\nStudy 2b utilized a qualitative framework to understand the instructors' pedagogical approach to teaching clinical skills.  In addition, researchers conducted qualitative interviews to examine the students' perceptions of the patient care and medical forensic exam skills gained from the clinical component in the SAFE training, and how the clinical training contributed to their skill development.\r\nStudy 3a explored knowledge retention using an online post-training survey given to students three months following the training.\r\nStudy 3b utilized the same qualitative framework as Study 2b.\r\nOnly data for studies 1, 2a, and 3a are available with this collection.\r\nThe data file has 198 cases and 675 variables.  The qualitative interviews for Studies 2b and 3b are not available as part of this data collection at this time.\r\n",

To assess if the training was effective, researchers conducted an outcome evaluation using a mixed methods approach, including quantitative pre-post training and qualitative interviews with instructors and students. The evaluation had three main components: 1) to assess training completion, including the percentage of students who completed the training and the factors that contributed to their completion; 2) to ascertain whether students attained knowledge through pre-test/post-tests and the factors that contributed to knowledge attainment; and 3) to determine whether students retained their knowledge using a post-training exam approximately three months following the training, and whether the students incorporated the core concepts of the training into their SAFE practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researchers divided the project into 3 studies.\r\nStudy 1 examined how many students completed the training and what predicted training completion.\r\nStudy 2a utilized a one-group pre-test post-test design where researchers assessed students' knowledge attainment for 12 online modules.\r\nStudy 2b utilized a qualitative framework to understand the instructors' pedagogical approach to teaching clinical skills.  In addition, researchers conducted qualitative interviews to examine the students' perceptions of the patient care and medical forensic exam skills gained from the clinical component in the SAFE training, and how the clinical training contributed to their skill development.\r\nStudy 3a explored knowledge retention using an online post-training survey given to students three months following the training.\r\nStudy 3b utilized the same qualitative framework as Study 2b.\r\nOnly data for studies 1, 2a, and 3a are available with this collection.\r\nThe data file has 198 cases and 675 variables.  The qualitative interviews for Studies 2b and 3b are not available as part of this data collection at this time.\r\n",

Experiences of bias and stigma contribute to lower rates of SA reporting by this population.  This results in victims with unmet needs and fewer criminal prosecutions of SA perpetrators. This study used a mixed-methods approach to collect data from lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women to instigate changes that would improve responses from law enforcement, victim services, and anti-violence programs that serve SMW.\r\n This study comprised of three parts a: baseline survey,  qualitative interview, and daily survey.  Self-reported baseline questionnaires included topics like lifetime victimization (childhood sexual abuse, adult sexual aggression, and assault), discrimination, distress, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual history. The qualitative interviews focused on the most recent, and when applicable, the most salient adult sexual assault (ASA) incident. Interviews began by asking the participants to describe their ASA incidents with follow-probes asking about the victimization, perpetrator characteristics (gender and relationship to participant), and context of assault (role of alcohol or drugs and setting). Participants were also asked if they discussed the assault with anyone and their reasons for disclosure or non-disclosure. As well as short and long-term coping patterns. The daily survey asked participants about their mood, alcohol use, drinking contexts, and sexual experiences (consensual and non-consensual).\r\n This study contains demographic information such as: age, race, income, education, and BMI.",

Experiences of bias and stigma contribute to lower rates of SA reporting by this population.  This results in victims with unmet needs and fewer criminal prosecutions of SA perpetrators. This study used a mixed-methods approach to collect data from lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women to instigate changes that would improve responses from law enforcement, victim services, and anti-violence programs that serve SMW.\r\n This study comprised of three parts a: baseline survey,  qualitative interview, and daily survey.  Self-reported baseline questionnaires included topics like lifetime victimization (childhood sexual abuse, adult sexual aggression, and assault), discrimination, distress, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual history. The qualitative interviews focused on the most recent, and when applicable, the most salient adult sexual assault (ASA) incident. Interviews began by asking the participants to describe their ASA incidents with follow-probes asking about the victimization, perpetrator characteristics (gender and relationship to participant), and context of assault (role of alcohol or drugs and setting). Participants were also asked if they discussed the assault with anyone and their reasons for disclosure or non-disclosure. As well as short and long-term coping patterns. The daily survey asked participants about their mood, alcohol use, drinking contexts, and sexual experiences (consensual and non-consensual).\r\n This study contains demographic information such as: age, race, income, education, and BMI.",

The study comprises four components: an implementation evaluation, a cost study, an impact study, and a community crime study.\r\nCommunity-crime-study: The community crime study used the arrest of juveniles from the NYPD (New York Police Department) data. The data can be found at (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). Data include all arrest for the juvenile crime during the life of the intervention. The 12 matched schools were identified and geo-mapped using Quantum GIS (QGIS) 3.8 software.  Block groups in the 2010 US Census in which the schools reside and neighboring block groups were mapped into micro-areas. This resulted in twelve experimental school blocks and 11 control blocks which the schools reside (two of the control schools existed in the same census block group). Additionally, neighboring blocks using were geo-mapped into 70 experimental and 77 control adjacent block groups (see map).  Finally, juvenile arrests were mapped into experimental and control areas. Using the ARIMA time-series method in Stata 15 statistical software package, arrest data were analyzed to compare the change in juvenile arrests in the experimental and control sites.\r\nCost-study: For the cost study, information from the implementing organization (Engaging Schools) was combined with data from phone conversations and follow-up communications with staff in school sites to populate a Resource Cost Model. The Resource Cost Model Excel file will be provided for archiving. This file contains details on the staff time and materials allocated to the intervention, as well as the NYC prices in 2018 US dollars associated with each element. Prices were gathered from multiple sources, including actual NYC DOE data on salaries for position types for which these data were available and district salary schedules for the other staff types.  Census data were used to calculate benefits.\r\nImpact-evaluation: The impact evaluation was conducted using data from the Research Alliance for New York City Schools. Among the core functions of the Research Alliance is maintaining a unique archive of longitudinal data on NYC schools to support ongoing research.

The goal was to promote positive outcomes and reduce police involvement in interactions between staff and students exhibiting inappropriate behavior through increased staff awareness of youth behavior, the functions of the juvenile justice system, and disproportionate minority contact (DMC) in disciplinary action.\r\n1,024 school staff participated in 51 ESSI training sessions throughought the 2015/16 academic year, which also serves as the training year in the longitudinal data. Schools which did not participate in the training served as controls for the participating school. Data were drawn from a panel of students enrolled in either a training or control school, with ten schools in each group. Data on this panel of students was collected for a five-year period, from the 2013/14 through the 2017/18 academic years.\r\nSchool-level data serves as the unit of analysis, as the study's main goal was to test the effects of training on school-wide outcomes. The estimated coefficient indicates small attendance reductions during the post-training phase for the training group. This indicates that most of the differences between the training and control group were statistically insignificant and that there was no pattern of statistically significant positive effects across the training schools. The second set of analyses, performed on student-level data, indicates that male and minority students are more likely to be involved in disciplinary incidents and to receive suspensions or expulsions as a consequence of their behaviors than White and female students.",

Toward that end, during Spring 2015, the study team adapted and finalized the middle school version of Maryland Safe and Supportive Schools (MDS3) model, ensuring that it was feasible and acceptable to implement in middle schools, thereby addressing aim 1. The study team then began a randomized controlled trial in Summer 2015, whereby they recruited, enrolled, and randomized 40 middle schools to intervention and control conditions. The study team then collected baseline (Spring 2015- Fall 2015) and annual follow-up data in the Spring of the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 school years. These data included: student, staff, and parent indicators via the online MDS3 School Climate Survey; implementation of positive behavior supports and multi-tiered interventions; classroom and environment observations using two measures: Assessing School Settings: Interactions of Students and Teachers (ASSIST; Rusby et al., 2001) and School Assessment for Environmental Typology (SAfETy; Bradshaw, Milam, Furr-Holden, and Lindstrom Johnson, 2015); and cost data assessing  the cost of program delivery in all 40 schools. Additionally,  the team collected implementation data from coaches in the 20 intervention schools, which included information on coaching fidelity and ratings of the school engagement. ",

-            "description": "Parents, siblings, partners, and friends are often the first people to suspect a loved one is on the trajectory towards targeted violence or terrorism. These intimate bystanders are well positioned to facilitate prevention efforts if there are known and trusted reporting pathways to law enforcement or other resources. Little is known in the United States about the reporting processes for intimate bystanders to targeted violence or terrorism.

To\r\nfill this gap in the literature, this project examined the ways that cultural\r\nbeliefs and contexts serve as a lens through which European-American,\r\nMexican-American, Korean-American, and Vietnamese-American women experience and\r\nrespond to IPV in their lives.\r\nCommunity-based recruitment techniques were used to recruit female\r\nsurvivors of intimate partner violence from the four target ethnic groups. Data collection included qualitative\r\ninterviews (n = 112) and online surveys (n = 193) with survivors of intimate\r\npartner violence as well as focus groups with service providers (n = 37). While there were many shared experiences\r\nacross survivors from the four ethnic groups, important differences in\r\nsurvivors' interpretation of abuse, strategies for managing the abuse, and\r\nhelp-seeking experiences did emerge.\r\nThese differences have important implications for the development of\r\nculturally competent prevention and intervention strategies for survivors from\r\ndifferent ethnic groups.\r\nThis collection only contains the online survey data. The focus group and individual interview data will be released at a future date.",

To\r\nfill this gap in the literature, this project examined the ways that cultural\r\nbeliefs and contexts serve as a lens through which European-American,\r\nMexican-American, Korean-American, and Vietnamese-American women experience and\r\nrespond to IPV in their lives.\r\nCommunity-based recruitment techniques were used to recruit female\r\nsurvivors of intimate partner violence from the four target ethnic groups. Data collection included qualitative\r\ninterviews (n = 112) and online surveys (n = 193) with survivors of intimate\r\npartner violence as well as focus groups with service providers (n = 37). While there were many shared experiences\r\nacross survivors from the four ethnic groups, important differences in\r\nsurvivors' interpretation of abuse, strategies for managing the abuse, and\r\nhelp-seeking experiences did emerge.\r\nThese differences have important implications for the development of\r\nculturally competent prevention and intervention strategies for survivors from\r\ndifferent ethnic groups.\r\nThis collection only contains the online survey data. The focus group and individual interview data will be released at a future date.",

After new bullying prevention programs were implemented, students were given the safety and bullying victimization survey which focused on perceptions of bullying and school safety.\r\n The number of bullying incidents, number of student victims and perpetrators, and the demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators were retained in aggregate form for each school were submitted to the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) for analysis.",

DETECT relies entirely on the medics' systematic observations of the older adults' physical and social environment -- no direct questioning of the older adult or their caregivers is involved. The DETECT tool was developed through an iterative, user-centered design process in which input was gathered from key stakeholders, and revisions to the tool incorporated their feedback. The intent was for that process to result in an EA screening tool that was easy for medics to use in the field and that helped medics capture information about older adults, their environments, and their caregivers that is thought to be associated with the occurrence of EA.",

Bias victimization measures considered both hate crimes (e.g. physical assault) and non-criminal bias events (e.g. racial slurs) and allowed the respondent to report multiple incidents, perpetrators, and types of bias victimization. The respondents were asked about their help-seeking and reporting behaviors for the experience of bias victimization they considered to be the most severe and the measures considered both formal (e.g. contacting the police) and informal (e.g. communicating with family) help-seeking behaviors. The victimization scale measured exposure to traumatic events (e.g. witnessing a murder) as well as experiences of victimization (e.g. physical assault). Acculturation and enculturation scales measured topics such as the respondent's use of Spanish and English and their consumption of media in both languages. The variables pertaining to acculturative stress considered factors such as feelings of social isolation, experiences of racism, and conflict with family members. The variables for mental health outcomes measured symptoms of anger, anxiety, depression, and disassociation.",

Despite the staggering individual and societal consequences of CSE, evidence-based prevention and intervention programs are profoundly lacking. This study used a quasi-experimental, mixed methods, longitudinal follow-up design to evaluate a service provision program for CSE survivors or those identified as high-risk for CSE, My Life My Choice (MLMC). Researchers followed youth who received MLMC services from baseline to multiple follow-up points to see how they progressed over time in terms of building up resistance to being sexually exploited.\r\nYouth received one of two different type of MLMC services. One group (Source 1) received one-on-one survivor mentoring, otherwise known as \"tertiary prevention.\" Participants in this program are paired with mentors who have been trained and free from CSE for at least five years. Mentors provide long-term and consistent emotional support to exploited youth or those MLMC believes are at high-risk for exploitation. The Source 1 youth were recruited only from Massachusetts. They participated in quantitative and qualitative data collection at baseline, six months post-baseline, and 12 months post-baseline.\r\nA second group (Source 2) received 3-10 sessions of a psychoeducational prevention group following the MLMC curriculum, otherwise known as \"secondary prevention.\" These groups are led by trained facilitators and are intended for youth at high-risk for exploitation. Participants are taught about sexual exploitation, healthy relationships, sexual health, and how to find help. Source 2 youth received MLMC services in Massachusetts, Florida, New Jersey, or Connecticut. They participated in quantitative data collection at baseline, time of the last group session, and six months post-baseline.\r\nMeasured outcomes included instances of sexual exploitation in the past six months, frequency and type of substance use, partner abuse victimization, and housing stability. Researchers hypothesized that, among the secondary prevention group, youth who chose to interact with MLMC staff more often (in terms of attending educational sessions) would score higher on desired outcomes than those frequently absent or who do not interact with staff as often. Among the tertiary prevention group, researchers hypothesized that those who participated would demonstrate improved outcomes from baseline to six months and baseline to 12 months.",

Evidence-based strategies that have been recently developed focus on shifting schools to a more proactive and positive approach by detecting warning signs and intervening early.

This grant-funded project was designed to enhance school capacity to implement a Tier 2 intervention, Student Engagement and Empowerment (SEE), to improve student attendance, behavior, and achievement, while simultaneously evaluating the effects of this intervention. The intervention and research project were individualized to fit existing school operations in the school district. A grant-funded coach supported delivery of SEE at each school for the duration of the 3-year grant. SEE was delivered by trained teachers in the classroom over the course of a seven-session curriculum. The overarching project goal was to scale up and simultaneously evaluate a Tier 2 intervention that could be sustained after completion of the grant.\r\nThe originally proposed research procedures consisted of an evaluation of the effects of the SEE program on the outcomes of students at elevated risk for disciplinary action and school dropout. Outcome data was collected for at-risk students in classrooms delivering the SEE program, and a comparison sample of at-risk students in classrooms not delivering the SEE program. Researchers initially hypothesized that students receiving the program would evidence a greater sense of belonging to school, endorse greater growth mindset, have better attendance and fewer suspensions/expulsions and course failure, and have better behavioral outcomes than students in the comparison group.",

This study includes aggregate monthly information on the number and rate of incidents of interpersonal violence and serious institutional misconduct in the Los Angeles County Jail System over an eight-year time period (January 2010 to December 2017). This investigation also includes information on the development and validation of two separate risk assessment tools--the Inmate Risk Assessment for Perpetration (IRAP) and the Inmate Risk Assessment for Victimization (IRAV)--that were designed to help authorities proactively identify the perpetrators and victims of interpersonal violence in jail, respectively. The subjects used to construct and test these instruments were an admission cohort of all adjudicated inmates entering the Los Angeles County jail system in 2016 (N = 104,919). This population of inmates was randomly assigned into one of four groups. The first was the construction sample (n = 26,404), which was used to create the two risk assessment scales, and the other three served as cross-validation samples, which each served to evaluate the predictive accuracy and reliability of these instruments. These data include individual-level information on inmate demographics, criminal history, and other measures of institutional behavior. ",

The VFM is a violence classification forecast and not an individual case prediction regarding offender behavior. Purpose The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of introducing forecasts of \"future dangerousness\" into PBPP's decision making process during parole interviews. The researcher anticipated that having available a sufficiently reliable forecast, particularly within the violent category, would reduce the likelihood of a parole release. The null hypothesis tested was that there would be no difference in parole release decisions when comparing two similar groups of offenders where during one group of parole interviews the decision maker had a forecast available and the other group of interviews there was not a forecast available.",

-            "description": "This research sought to evaluate the implementation of body worn cameras (BWCs) in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Researchers employed three strategies to evaluate the impact of BWCs in the department: 1) two-wave officer surveys about BWCs, 2) two-wave Systematic Social Observations (SSOs) of citizen interactions from officer ride-alongs, and 3) a time series analysis of existing LAPD data of use of force and complaint data.\r\nThe officer surveys were conducted in the Mission and Newton divisions of the LAPD before and after BWCs were implemented. The survey instrument was designed to measure perceptions of BWCs across a variety of domains and took approximately 20 minutes to complete. Researchers attended roll calls for all shifts and units to request officer participation and administered the surveys on tablets using the Qualtrics software. The pre-deployment survey was administered in both divisions August and September 2015. The post-deployment surveys were conducted with a subset of officers who participated in the pre-deployment surveys during a two-week period in the summer of 2016, approximately nine months following the initial rollout of BWCs.\r\nThe SSO data was collected in the Mission and Newton divisions prior to and following BWC implementation. The pre-administration SSOs were conducted in August and September 2015 and the post-administration SSOs were conducted in June and August, 2016. Trained observers spent 725 hours riding with and collecting observational data on the encounters between officers and citizens using tablets to perform field coding using Qualtrics software. A total of 124 rides (71 from Wave I and 53 from Wave II) were completed between both Newton and Mission Divisions. These observations included 514 encounters and involved coding the interactions of 1,022 citizens, 555 of which were deemed to be citizens who had full contact, which was defined as a minute or more of face-time or at least three verbal exchanges.\r\nPatrol officers (including special units) for ride-alongs were selected from a master list of officers scheduled to work each day and shift throughout the observation period. Up to five officers within each shift were randomly identified as potential participants for observation from this master list and observers would select the first available officer from this list. For each six-hour observation period, or approximately one-half of a shift, the research staff observed the interactions between the assigned officer, his or her partner, and any citizens he or she encountered. In Wave 2, SSOs were conducted with the same officers from Wave 1.\r\nThe time series data were obtained from the LAPD use of force and complaint databases for each of the 21 separate patrol divisions, a metropolitan patrol division, and four traffic divisions of the LAPD. These data cover the time period where BWC were implemented throughout the LAPD on a staggered basis by division from 2015 to 2018. The LAPD operates using four-week deployment periods (DPs), and there are approximately 13 deployment periods per year. These data span the period of the beginning of 2012 through the 2017 DP 12. These data were aggregated to counts by deployment period based on the date of the originating incident. The LAPD collects detailed information about each application of force by an officer within an encounter. For this reason, separate use of force counts are based on incidents, officers, and use of force applications. Similarly, the LAPD also collects information on each allegation for each officer within a complaint and public complaint counts are based on incidents, officers, and allegations.",

Trained observers spent 725 hours riding with and collecting observational data on the encounters between officers and citizens using tablets to perform field coding using Qualtrics software. A total of 124 rides (71 from Wave I and 53 from Wave II) were completed between both Newton and Mission Divisions. These observations included 514 encounters and involved coding the interactions of 1,022 citizens, 555 of which were deemed to be citizens who had full contact, which was defined as a minute or more of face-time or at least three verbal exchanges.\r\nPatrol officers (including special units) for ride-alongs were selected from a master list of officers scheduled to work each day and shift throughout the observation period. Up to five officers within each shift were randomly identified as potential participants for observation from this master list and observers would select the first available officer from this list. For each six-hour observation period, or approximately one-half of a shift, the research staff observed the interactions between the assigned officer, his or her partner, and any citizens he or she encountered. In Wave 2, SSOs were conducted with the same officers from Wave 1.\r\nThe time series data were obtained from the LAPD use of force and complaint databases for each of the 21 separate patrol divisions, a metropolitan patrol division, and four traffic divisions of the LAPD. These data cover the time period where BWC were implemented throughout the LAPD on a staggered basis by division from 2015 to 2018. The LAPD operates using four-week deployment periods (DPs), and there are approximately 13 deployment periods per year. These data span the period of the beginning of 2012 through the 2017 DP 12. These data were aggregated to counts by deployment period based on the date of the originating incident. The LAPD collects detailed information about each application of force by an officer within an encounter. For this reason, separate use of force counts are based on incidents, officers, and use of force applications. Similarly, the LAPD also collects information on each allegation for each officer within a complaint and public complaint counts are based on incidents, officers, and allegations.",

The purpose of the development phase was to test the reliability of this tool in detecting elder abuse in ages 65 and older individuals. On the other hand, the validation phase was to test the tool at three different locations: UNC Medical Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey, and University of Florida Health in Jacksonville, Florida.\r\n",

Improving the quality of information about human trafficking is critical to developing sound anti-trafficking policy.

The planning phase was designed to produce a comprehensive plan to conduct a generalizable, longitudinal study examining long-term trajectories of risk for, experiences with, and recovery after experiencing violence and victimization among college-aged individuals. This pilot study was the result of this planning phase. \r\nThe major variables in this study contained information regarding sexual assault and rape, dating violence, stalking, violence committed by peers, and violence committed by strangers, as well as demographic variables such as participant age, gender, and race.",

This study sought to examine how IV might differ between young adults who go to college compared to those that do not go to college. \r\n To better understand the risks for, experiences with, and consequences of IV among young adults, in fiscal year 2016, the National Institute for Justice (NIJ) made an award to Westat to fund the planning phase of a longitudinal study to research the victimization and violence experienced by college-aged individuals.  The planning phase was designed to produce a comprehensive plan to conduct a generalizable, longitudinal study examining long-term trajectories of risk for, experiences with, and recovery after experiencing violence and victimization among college-aged individuals. This pilot study was the result of this planning phase. \r\nThe major variables in this study contained information regarding sexual assault and rape, dating violence, stalking, violence committed by peers, and violence committed by strangers, as well as demographic variables such as participant age, gender, and race.",

The investigators sought to better understand the nature of the problem and clarify the types of shooting incidents occurring in schools,  provide information on the characteristics of school shooters, and compare fatal shooting incidents to events where only injuries resulted to identify intervention points that could be exploited to reduce the harm caused by shootings. To accomplish these objectives, the investigators used quantitative multivariate and qualitative case studies research methods to document where and when school violence occurs, and highlight key incident and perpetrator level characteristics to help law enforcement and school administrators differentiate between the kinds of school shootings that exist, to further policy responses that are appropriate for individuals and communities.",

To accomplish these objectives, the investigators used quantitative multivariate and qualitative case studies research methods to document where and when school violence occurs, and highlight key incident and perpetrator level characteristics to help law enforcement and school administrators differentiate between the kinds of school shootings that exist, to further policy responses that are appropriate for individuals and communities.",

The goal is to develop a research strategy and survey instrument for collecting information on the violence and victimization experiences of American Indian and Alaska Native youth in tribal communities and other settings throughout the country. The study purpose is to determine and pilot test the tools and methods for conducting a future national level study. The data will be used to guide survey development, protocols and administration in tribal and other settings. This study included five (5) required tasks that framed the approach, methods, approvals, and deliverables, divided into three stages focused on three distinct phases - instrumentation, cognitive testing, and pilot testing. Phase 1 focused on development of the survey and the methods for survey administration to be tested. No data was collected during Phase 1 and was exempted from IRB review by the University of Nevada Las Vegas Human Subjects Biomedical Review Board. Phase 2 focused on testing recruitment methods and cognitive testing of the draft survey instrument.

Office of the State Superintendent of Education, and with funding from the National Institute of Justice's Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, implemented and evaluated the Safe School Certification (SSC) Program, a three-year technical assistance model to support schools in strengthening organizational capacity across eight elements key to improving school climate: leadership, data, buy-in, policy and policy enforcement, student engagement, family and community engagement, training, and programs and practices. To help support schools' efforts, and to evaluate SSC's effectiveness, survey data were collected annually from students, parents, instructional staff, and non-instructional staff at participating schools using the U.S. Department of Education's School Climate Survey (EDSCLS), which was adapted to include measures of sexual orientation and gender identity, grit, and personal experiences of bullying and fights. Additionally, observations using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System - Secondary (CLASS-S) were conducted in a random sample of five classrooms in each participating school each year. Finally, as part of the implementation evaluation, interviews were conducted with the technical assistance providers, points of contact or leadership at participating schools, the SSC developer, and the manager of the Certification Advisory Board (CAB), which provided feedback to schools over the course of implementation through reviews of compiled workbooks.",

Researchers collected data on both holistic and traditional defense delivery via interviews, surveys, focus groups, observation during site visits, and administrative data from public defender and court information systems. This evaluation was conducted in three research sites: Rhode Island Public Defender (Providence office); Minnesota Public Defender (Minneapolis office); and the Kentucky Department of Public Advocacy (Bowling Green office).

The impact evaluation used a quasi-experimental design that includes matched comparison groups and alternative statistical models to examine the relative impact of holistic defense on a range of outcomes, controlling for defendant characteristics.

The seven evaluation sites were located in California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The objectives of the outcome evaluation were to determine the effects of program participation on recidivism and other outcomes and assess whether program participation increased engagement in services, including substance abuse treatment and mental health services. The outcome evaluation consisted of two components:\r\n1. Cross-site prospective study designed to collect longitudinal survey data with a sample of program participants and appropriate comparison or control subjects to assess the impact of the SCA funding on access to services and reentry outcomes, such as substance use, employment, housing, and health. \r\n2. Site-specific recidivism analyses using administrative data to assess the impact of AORDP program participation on recidivism outcomes for all individuals enrolled in the AORDP programs and a matched comparison group in each site",

The objectives of the outcome evaluation were to determine the effects of program participation on recidivism and other outcomes and assess whether program participation increased engagement in services, including substance abuse treatment and mental health services. The outcome evaluation consisted of two components:\r\n1. Cross-site prospective study designed to collect longitudinal survey data with a sample of program participants and appropriate comparison or control subjects to assess the impact of the SCA funding on access to services and reentry outcomes, such as substance use, employment, housing, and health. \r\n2. Site-specific recidivism analyses using administrative data to assess the impact of AORDP program participation on recidivism outcomes for all individuals enrolled in the AORDP programs and a matched comparison group in each site",

Recently, financial education programs have been developed and tested with survivors of IPV. However, only a few rigorous evaluations of economic empowerment interventions exist with survivors of IPV in the U.S., and none assess the language and cultural differences among Spanish-speaking survivors.\r\nThis study tested and validated measures related to financial empowerment and partner violence with English and Spanish-speaking IPV survivors to address this gap. The specific objectives of the project were to: (1) Test and revise financial and abuse scales which were pre-existing or adapted from scales used in the general population for use with IPV survivors in both English and Spanish utilizing a secondary dataset, and (2) Further test and validate measures analyzed as part of Objective One with a similar sample of IPV survivors in both English and Spanish to determine if these scales are appropriate for use with IPV populations.\r\nThis study was conducted in two phases to address each of its objectives. The first objective was completed during Phase I, and the second objective during Phase II. Data for Phase II was gathered through individual interviews, either face-to-face or over the phone. Interviewers used a structured questionnaire, with the nine financial and abuse scales, in the participant's preferred language, English or Spanish. These nine scales were:\r\n\r\nFinancial Knowledge Scale - to determine survivors' knowledge about financial management.\r\nFinancial Management Attitudes Scale - to determine survivors' attitudes about financial management.\r\nScale of Economic Self-Efficacy - to determine survivors' confidence in their financial management abilities.\r\nScale of Financial Behaviors - to determine survivors' actual financial management behaviors.\r\nScale of Financial Intentions - to determine survivors' intentions to perform particular financial behaviors.\r\nScale of Economic Self-Sufficiency - to determine survivors' abilities to accomplish financial tasks.\r\nFinancial Strain Survey - to determine survivors' strain in managing their financial health.\r\nAbusive Behavior Inventory - to determine survivors' experiences with physical, emotional, and sexual violence.\r\nScale of Economic Abuse-12 - to determine survivors' experiences with economic abuse.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the questionnaire gathered demographic information including: age, ethnicity, employment status, education level, marital status, and annual income.",

These nine scales were:\r\n\r\nFinancial Knowledge Scale - to determine survivors' knowledge about financial management.\r\nFinancial Management Attitudes Scale - to determine survivors' attitudes about financial management.\r\nScale of Economic Self-Efficacy - to determine survivors' confidence in their financial management abilities.\r\nScale of Financial Behaviors - to determine survivors' actual financial management behaviors.\r\nScale of Financial Intentions - to determine survivors' intentions to perform particular financial behaviors.\r\nScale of Economic Self-Sufficiency - to determine survivors' abilities to accomplish financial tasks.\r\nFinancial Strain Survey - to determine survivors' strain in managing their financial health.\r\nAbusive Behavior Inventory - to determine survivors' experiences with physical, emotional, and sexual violence.\r\nScale of Economic Abuse-12 - to determine survivors' experiences with economic abuse.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the questionnaire gathered demographic information including: age, ethnicity, employment status, education level, marital status, and annual income.",

Conducted between March, 2011 and January, 2012, it assessed the experiences of a nationally representative sample of 4,503 children aged 1 month to 18 years living in the contiguous United States (excluding New Hampshire). \r\nA nationwide sample which excluded any phone numbers with area codes assigned within the state of New Hampshire was constructed using four frames: (1) 801,317 landline telephone numbers from which telephone households could be drawn by random digit dialing (RDD); (2) 5,000 cell-phone telephone numbers from which a sample of cell phone users could be drawn by RDD; (3) an address-based sample (ABS) of 70,924 cell phone and residential numbers; and (4) a pre-screened sample of 3,573 telephone numbers of households with children from a recent national RDD survey. The compiled frame yielded 3,259 residential RDD interviews, 31 cell phone RDD interviews, 750 ABS interviews, and 463 pre-screened sample interviews for a total of 4,503 interviews.\r\nA short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usually a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One child was randomly selected from all eligible children in a household by selecting the child with the most recent birthday. If the selected child was 1 month to 9 years old, the main interview was conducted with the caregiver. If the selected child was 10-17 years old, the main interview was conducted with the child.\r\nThe survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), an inventory of childhood victimization. This version of the JVQ obtains reports on 53 forms of offenses against youth that cover six general areas of concern including: conventional crime, child maltreatment, peer and sibling victimization, sexual victimization, witnessing and indirect victimization, and internet victimization. Follow-up questions for each victimization item gathered additional information about the victimization incident.",

Conducted between March, 2011 and January, 2012, it assessed the experiences of a nationally representative sample of 4,503 children aged 1 month to 18 years living in the contiguous United States (excluding New Hampshire). \r\nA nationwide sample which excluded any phone numbers with area codes assigned within the state of New Hampshire was constructed using four frames: (1) 801,317 landline telephone numbers from which telephone households could be drawn by random digit dialing (RDD); (2) 5,000 cell-phone telephone numbers from which a sample of cell phone users could be drawn by RDD; (3) an address-based sample (ABS) of 70,924 cell phone and residential numbers; and (4) a pre-screened sample of 3,573 telephone numbers of households with children from a recent national RDD survey. The compiled frame yielded 3,259 residential RDD interviews, 31 cell phone RDD interviews, 750 ABS interviews, and 463 pre-screened sample interviews for a total of 4,503 interviews.\r\nA short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usually a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One child was randomly selected from all eligible children in a household by selecting the child with the most recent birthday. If the selected child was 1 month to 9 years old, the main interview was conducted with the caregiver. If the selected child was 10-17 years old, the main interview was conducted with the child.\r\nThe survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), an inventory of childhood victimization. This version of the JVQ obtains reports on 53 forms of offenses against youth that cover six general areas of concern including: conventional crime, child maltreatment, peer and sibling victimization, sexual victimization, witnessing and indirect victimization, and internet victimization. Follow-up questions for each victimization item gathered additional information about the victimization incident.",

The organizations whose activities were\r\nevaluated were (1) the Constitution Rights Foundation, (2) Law in a\r\nFree Society, (3) the National Street Law Institute, (4) the American\r\nBar Association's Special Committee on Youth Education for\r\nCitizenship, (5) the Children's Legal Rights Information and Training\r\nProgram, and (6) the Phi Alpha Delta Committee for Juvenile\r\nJustice. The evaluation research dealt primarily with two types of\r\nissues: (1) the degree of increase in awareness of and receptivity\r\ntoward LRE among the nation's educators, juvenile justice, and other\r\nrelated professionals, as well as the degree of institutionalization\r\nof LRE in certain targeted states (i.e., California, Michigan, and\r\nNorth Carolina), and (2) the degree to which LRE could produce changes\r\nin students' knowledge of and attitudes about the law, and reduce\r\njuvenile delinquency (measured both by self-reported delinquency rates\r\nand by attitudes previously shown to be correlated with delinquent\r\nbehavior). In 1981 (Part 1) and again in 1982 (Part 2), questionnaires\r\nwere mailed to a sample of professionals in state educational\r\norganizations as well as to elementary and secondary school\r\nprincipals, juvenile justice specialists, juvenile and family court\r\njudges, police chiefs, and law school deans. Respondents were asked\r\nwhether they had heard of the various projects, what they thought of\r\nLRE in terms of its impact on students and usefulness in the\r\ncurriculum, whether LRE should be required, what type of publicity had\r\ncontributed to their awareness of LRE, and the degree of involvement\r\nthey would be willing to have in promoting or developing LRE\r\nprograms. In a second component of the study, primary and secondary\r\nschool students were selected for an impact evaluation of the LRE\r\nactivities run by the six organizations under evaluation.\r\nQuestionnaires were administered to students during academic years\r\n1982-1983 (Part 3) and 1983-1984 (Part 4), before and after\r\nparticipating in LRE courses offered by the programs under\r\nevaluation. Control students (not taking LRE courses) were also used\r\nfor the comparisons. The questionnaires tested the knowledge,\r\nattitudes (measuring such factors as isolation from school, delinquent\r\npeer influence, negative labeling, and attitudes toward violence), and\r\nself-reported delinquency of school children. Demographic information\r\ncollected about the student respondents includes sex, age, race, grade\r\nin school, and grade-point average.",

The data files \r\n provide information on juveniles' progress through the juvenile justice \r\n system from the time of referral to juvenile court to final \r\n disposition. Variables include sex, race, and birth date of the \r\n juveniles, court referral date, major allegation, number of law \r\n violations, number of prior referrals, detention status, jail status, \r\ncourt orders, placement status, and final court action.",

Cities were screened with\r\n selection criteria including the presence and recognition of a youth\r\n gang problem and the presence of a youth gang program as an organized\r\n response to the problem. Respondents were classified into several major\r\n categories and subcategories: law enforcement (mainly police,\r\n prosecutors, judges, probation, corrections, and parole), schools\r\n (subdivided into security and academic personnel), community, county,\r\n or state planners, other, and community/service (subdivided into youth\r\n service, youth and family service/treatment, comprehensive crisis\r\n intervention, and grassroots groups). These data include variables\r\n coded from respondents' definitions of the gang, gang member, and gang\r\n incident. Also included are respondents' historical accounts of the\r\n gang problems in their areas. Information on the size and scope of the\r\ngang problem and response was also solicited.",

-            "description": "There is much variability in the adult outcomes of youth who have been involved in the Juvenile Justice System (JJS). It is increasingly recognized that disparate outcomes may reflect the extent to which JJS involvement intersects with developmental patterns of delinquency and is attuned to normative adolescent development, such as maturing self-regulation. However, little is known about the ways in which JJS services influence maturing self-regulation, and how change in these processes will impact delinquency trajectories extending through early adulthood. Even less is known about the impact of JJS on developmental trajectories of delinquency and self-regulation in adolescent girls, despite the rapid increase of girls' involvement in the JJS in recent years.\r\nThe goal of the current study was to advance knowledge to support effective JJS programs and policies by examining the interface between adolescent self-regulation development, delinquency, and JJS involvement. This project built on the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS): a large, longitudinal, racially diverse, urban community sample of females that had been followed annually for 13 years since childhood. New data were collected with support from grant 2013-JF-FX-0058 from a subset of PGS participants at ages 19 and 20 years to capture patterns of delinquency persistence and desistance and to assess outcomes in young adulthood. At the end of the funding period, 88% of the original sample of participants had been interviewed through age 20. In addition, official juvenile justice criminal records were gathered for all 2,450 PGS participants. Analyses were conducted to examine: 1) the impact of JJS involvement on developmental trajectories of delinquency and young adult adjustment; 2) the impact of JJS involvement on self-regulation maturation; 3) the relationship between self-regulation development and change in delinquency and young adult adjustment; and 4) mechanisms during adolescence that explain the link between JJS involvement and delinquency. Results showed JJS involvement predicted concurrent and subsequent changes in self-control during adolescence as well as increased risk for subsequent delinquent behavior, poor educational attainment, employment status, and less satisfaction with life in young adulthood. Moreover, self-control in adolescence partially mediated several of the observed prospective associations between JJS involvement and young adult outcomes. These findings add to a research base that can help policymakers better understand how JJS interventions impact normative developmental processes in ways that influence the course of delinquency. Such information is a critical step in improving outcomes of adolescent girls involved in the JJS through the improvement of interventions promoting self-regulation maturation, accountability, resilience and desistance.",
