-            "description": "The data for this study were collected in order to examine\r\nthe delivery of police services in selected\r\nneighborhoods. Performances of police agencies organized in different\r\nways were compared as they delivered services to different sets of\r\ncomparable neighborhoods. For Part 1, Citizen Debriefing Data, data\r\nwere drawn from telephone interviews conducted with citizens who were\r\ninvolved in police-citizen encounters or who requested police services\r\nduring the observed shifts. The file contains data on the citizens\r\ninvolved in observed encounters, their satisfaction with the delivered\r\nservices, and neighborhood characteristics. This file includes\r\nvariables such as the type of incident, estimated property loss,\r\npolice response time, type of action taken by police, citizen\r\nsatisfaction with the handling of the problem by police, reasons for\r\ndissatisfaction, the emotional state of the citizen during the\r\nencounter, whom the officers referred the citizen to for help, the\r\ncitizen's prior contacts with police, and the citizen's education,\r\nage, sex, and total family income. Part 2, General Shift Information,\r\ncontains data describing the shift (i.e., the eight-hour tour of duty\r\nto which the officers were assigned), the officers, and the events\r\noccurring during an observed shift. This file includes such variables\r\nas the total number of encounters, a breakdown of dispatched runs by\r\ntype, the number of contacts with other officers, the number of\r\ncontacts with non-police support units, officer discretion in taking\r\nlegal action, and officer attitudes on patrol styles and\r\nactivities. Part 3, Police Encounters Data, describes police\r\nencounters observed by the research team during selected shifts. It\r\nconsists of information describing the officers' role in encounters\r\nwith citizens observed during a shift and their demeanor toward the\r\ncitizens involved. The file includes variables such as the type of\r\nencounter, how the encounter began, whether the citizens involved\r\npossessed a weapon, the encounter location, what other agencies were\r\npresent during the encounter and when they arrived, police actions\r\nduring the encounter, the role of citizens involved in the encounter,\r\nthe demeanor of the officer toward the citizens during the encounter,\r\nactions taken by the citizens, which services were requested by the\r\ncitizens, and how the observer affected the encounter.

Performances of police agencies organized in different\r\nways were compared as they delivered services to different sets of\r\ncomparable neighborhoods. For Part 1, Citizen Debriefing Data, data\r\nwere drawn from telephone interviews conducted with citizens who were\r\ninvolved in police-citizen encounters or who requested police services\r\nduring the observed shifts. The file contains data on the citizens\r\ninvolved in observed encounters, their satisfaction with the delivered\r\nservices, and neighborhood characteristics. This file includes\r\nvariables such as the type of incident, estimated property loss,\r\npolice response time, type of action taken by police, citizen\r\nsatisfaction with the handling of the problem by police, reasons for\r\ndissatisfaction, the emotional state of the citizen during the\r\nencounter, whom the officers referred the citizen to for help, the\r\ncitizen's prior contacts with police, and the citizen's education,\r\nage, sex, and total family income. Part 2, General Shift Information,\r\ncontains data describing the shift (i.e., the eight-hour tour of duty\r\nto which the officers were assigned), the officers, and the events\r\noccurring during an observed shift. This file includes such variables\r\nas the total number of encounters, a breakdown of dispatched runs by\r\ntype, the number of contacts with other officers, the number of\r\ncontacts with non-police support units, officer discretion in taking\r\nlegal action, and officer attitudes on patrol styles and\r\nactivities. Part 3, Police Encounters Data, describes police\r\nencounters observed by the research team during selected shifts. It\r\nconsists of information describing the officers' role in encounters\r\nwith citizens observed during a shift and their demeanor toward the\r\ncitizens involved. The file includes variables such as the type of\r\nencounter, how the encounter began, whether the citizens involved\r\npossessed a weapon, the encounter location, what other agencies were\r\npresent during the encounter and when they arrived, police actions\r\nduring the encounter, the role of citizens involved in the encounter,\r\nthe demeanor of the officer toward the citizens during the encounter,\r\nactions taken by the citizens, which services were requested by the\r\ncitizens, and how the observer affected the encounter. Part 4,\r\nVictimization Survey Data, examined citizen attitudes about the police and\r\ncrime in their neighborhoods. The data were obtained through telephone\r\ninterviews conducted by trained interviewers. These interviews\r\nfollowed a standard questionnaire designed by the project\r\nleaders.

Eleven types of crimes are included: bank robbery,\r\nembezzlement, income tax evasion, mail theft, forgery, drugs, random\r\nother, false claims, homicide, bribery of a public official, and mail\r\nfraud.

The EASI Temperament Survey, introduced in the\r\n mid-1970s by Arnold H.

For the purposes of the PHDCN\r\n Longitudinal Cohort Study, the EASI Temperament Survey was\r\n administered both to subjects and primary caregivers (PC). The young\r\n adults comprising cohort 18 completed the EASI Temperament Survey as a\r\n self-report inventory, while the primary caregivers of children\r\n belonging to cohorts 3 through 15 completed the EASI Temperament\r\n measure as a parental ratings survey. Respondents were asked to\r\n determine how accurately the behaviors or personality traits\r\n mentioned, characterized the subject in question, either themselves or\r\n their child. The responses to the EASI measure were used to evaluate\r\n the subjects' various social tendencies, emotional characteristics,\r\nand personality traits.",

Numerous measures were administered to respondents to\r\n gauge various aspects of human development, including individual\r\n differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One of\r\n the measures employed by the Longitudinal Cohort Study was the\r\n Emotionality, Activity, Sociability, and Impulsivity (EASI)\r\n Temperament Survey. The EASI Temperament Survey, introduced in the\r\n mid-1970s by Arnold H. Buss and Robert Plomin, was designed to\r\n evaluate subjects based on four temperaments (emotionality, activity,\r\n sociability, and impulsivity). For the purposes of the PHDCN\r\n Longitudinal Cohort Study, the EASI Temperament Survey was\r\n administered both to subjects and primary caregivers (PC). The young\r\n adults comprising cohort 18 completed the EASI Temperament Survey as a\r\n self-report inventory, while the primary caregivers of children\r\n belonging to cohorts 3 through 15 completed the EASI Temperament\r\n measure as a parental ratings survey. Respondents were asked to\r\n determine how accurately the behaviors or personality traits\r\n mentioned, characterized the subject in question, either themselves or\r\n their child. The responses to the EASI measure were used to evaluate\r\n the subjects' various social tendencies, emotional characteristics,\r\nand personality traits.",

A total of 311 adult arrestees were interviewed and provided a urine sample submitted for testing. The dual risk screening instrument includes six mental disorder risk questions and six substance abuse risk questions.  The mental disorder risk questions include questions on having feelings or emotions that make it difficult to complete normal day to day activities, feeling hopeless or depressed, having thoughts of hurting oneself or committing suicide, and hearing or seeing things that others cannot hear or see. The substance abuse risk questions include questions on problems caused by drinking or drug use, arrests due to alcohol or drug use, time spent on thinking about or trying to get alcohol or drugs, and feelings of guilt about drinking or drug use.",

Filing rates were measured\r\n at the level of district courts, grouped together by the circuit court\r\n that has jurisdiction over them.\r\nVariables in Dataset 1, Civil Rights Suits Filed, include filing\r\n date and the number of civil rights suits filed per 10,000 state\r\n prisoners at the national level as well as for district courts within\r\n each of the 11 circuits and the District of Columbia. An intervention\r\n flag variable is also included. Variables in Dataset 2, Habeas Corpus\r\n Petitions Filed, include filing date and the number of habeas\r\n corpus petitions filed per 10,000 state prisoners at the national\r\n level, as well as for district courts within each of the 11 circuits\r\n and the District of Columbia. A pulse flag variable and two\r\nintervention flag variables are also included.",

A mixed method approach was developed to conduct the evaluation. The researchers used a classic triangulation framework of quantitative agency data, telephone survey interviews, mail surveys, interviews and focus groups with service providers, and case studies. The evaluation of effectiveness included (1) before-after analysis of caseload data on 88,901 clients and (2) interviews with 124 LAV clients. The range of local activities and programs was documented primarily through two mail surveys of grantees. For Part 1 (2001 Mail Survey), data include information regarding project staffing, partnerships, legal and advocacy services provided, and implementation challenges. It was completed by 156 grantees. Part 2 (2003 Mail Survey) was administered to the 2001 survey respondents who had also received continuation grants in 2001 or 2002. It was completed by 79 grantees. This survey sought information on successful practices for achieving key project objectives. It also attempted to quantify the number and types of legal services provided and gain more quantitative information on unmet needs. Part 3 (Legal Assistance for Victims Data) contains caseload data including demographics related to clients such as gender, ethnicity, and income. It also contains information regarding the case including type of case, hours worked on the case, and results of the case. There are also data related to the agency such as jurisdiction of the agency and type of agency. For Part 4 (Victims Interviews), data include demographic information, history and background of the case, legal services received, satisfaction with legal services, impact of legal services, and the victim's current situation.",

The study also assesses the impact of SB 123 on the work routines of criminal justice system actors, examining changes in sentencing and supervision practices and interactions across agencies following the implementation of SB 123.\r\n\r\nIndividual-level impacts of SB 123 on recidivism rates are assessed using sentencing and revocation data collected by the Kansas Sentencing Commission for drug possessors sentenced in Kansas between November 1, 2001 and October 31, 2008 (Dataset 1). Propensity score matching was used to compare the revocation and reconviction rates of drug possessors sentenced to SB 123 with the recidivism rates of similar individuals sentenced to regular probation (standard supervision by community corrections or court services) (Dataset 2). Supervision and program participation data provided by the Kansas Department of Corrections were used to assess the use of drug treatment services, education and employment services, and sanctions for individuals sentenced to SB 123 or standard community corrections (Dataset 3). These quantitative data were complemented by a set qualitative data derived from interviews with SB 123-eligible offenders (Dataset 4), community corrections managers, and courtroom actors (judges, prosecutors, public defenders) (Dataset 5).

The study also assesses the impact of SB 123 on the work routines of criminal justice system actors, examining changes in sentencing and supervision practices and interactions across agencies following the implementation of SB 123.\r\n\r\nIndividual-level impacts of SB 123 on recidivism rates are assessed using sentencing and revocation data collected by the Kansas Sentencing Commission for drug possessors sentenced in Kansas between November 1, 2001 and October 31, 2008 (Dataset 1). Propensity score matching was used to compare the revocation and reconviction rates of drug possessors sentenced to SB 123 with the recidivism rates of similar individuals sentenced to regular probation (standard supervision by community corrections or court services) (Dataset 2). Supervision and program participation data provided by the Kansas Department of Corrections were used to assess the use of drug treatment services, education and employment services, and sanctions for individuals sentenced to SB 123 or standard community corrections (Dataset 3). These quantitative data were complemented by a set qualitative data derived from interviews with SB 123-eligible offenders (Dataset 4), community corrections managers, and courtroom actors (judges, prosecutors, public defenders) (Dataset 5).

Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers used capture-recapture sampling and multiple data sources to gauge the impact of drug trafficking in Quebec, Canada on the United States drug market. The main analyses were based on arrest data that were obtained for Quebec. In addition, analysis of the chemical composition and price assessments of the Quebec synthetic drugs was done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study includes one SPSS data file (Quebec Arrest Data (Synthetic Drugs Cases, September 2014; n=20261)-ICPSR.sav ; n=20,261 ; 13 variables) and one Excel data file (Chemical composition of seized synthetic drugs.xls ; n=365 ; 14 variables).\r\n\r\n\r\nSpatial analyses of border seizure data was performed by the researchers, but these data are not available at this time.  The data used for these analyses concerned synthetic drug seizures at Canadian borders from 2007 to 2012. The dataset was provided by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). For each seizure, the specific border crossing where the seizure was made was provided, as well as the value of the seizure (except for precursors), the country of origin and the type of drug seized. The types of drugs were classified into five types: (1) Precursors, (2) MDMA, (3) Amphetamine, (4) Methamphetamine and (5) Others. Most of the seizures (86.6 percent) were classified in this last category. The country of origin of the seizure was also provided.\r\n",

The data used for these analyses concerned synthetic drug seizures at Canadian borders from 2007 to 2012. The dataset was provided by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). For each seizure, the specific border crossing where the seizure was made was provided, as well as the value of the seizure (except for precursors), the country of origin and the type of drug seized. The types of drugs were classified into five types: (1) Precursors, (2) MDMA, (3) Amphetamine, (4) Methamphetamine and (5) Others. Most of the seizures (86.6 percent) were classified in this last category. The country of origin of the seizure was also provided.\r\n",

-            "description": "This data collection, conducted in a federal penitentiary\r\nand prison camp in Terre Haute, Indiana, between September 1986 and\r\nJuly 1988, was undertaken to examine the reliability and validity of\r\npsychological classification systems for adult male inmates. The\r\nclassification systems tested were Warren's Interpersonal Maturity\r\nLevel (I-level), Quay Adult Internal Management Systems (AIMS),\r\nJesness Inventory, Megargee's MMPI-Based Prison Typology, and Hunt's\r\nConceptual Level. The study sought to answer the following questions:\r\n(a) Which psychological classification systems or combination of\r\nsystems could be used most effectively with adult populations? (b)\r\nWhat procedures (e.g., interview, paper-and-pencil test, staff\r\nassessment, or combination) would assure maximum efficiency without\r\ncompromising psychometric precision? (c) What could the commonalities\r\nand differences among the systems reveal about the specific systems\r\nand about general classification issues pertinent to this population?\r\nand (d) How could the systems better portray the prison experience?\r\nThe penitentiary was a low-maximum-security facility and the prison\r\ncamp was a minimum-security one. A total of 179 penitentiary inmates\r\nand 190 camp inmates participated. The study employed both a pre-post\r\nand a correlational design. At intake, project staff members\r\ninterviewed inmates, obtained social, demographic, and criminal\r\nhistory background data from administrative records and test scores,\r\nand then classified the inmates by means of an I-level\r\ndiagnosis. Social and demographic data collected at intake included\r\ndate of entry into the prison, age, race, marital status, number of\r\ndependents, education, recorded psychological diagnoses, occupation\r\nand social economic status, military service, evidence of problems in\r\nthe military, ability to hold a job, and residential\r\nstability. Criminal history data provided include age at first\r\nnontraffic arrest, arrests and convictions, prison or jail sentences,\r\nalcohol or drug use, total number and kinds of charges for current\r\noffense, types of weapon and victims involved, co-offender\r\ninvolvement, victim-offender relationship, if the criminal activity\r\nrequired complex skills, type of conviction, and sentence\r\nlength. T-scores for social maladjustment, immaturity, autism,\r\nalienation, manifest aggression, withdrawal, social anxiety,\r\nrepression, and denial were also gathered via the Jesness Inventory\r\nand the MMPI. Interview data cover the inmates' interactions within\r\nthe prison, their concerns about prison life, their primary\r\ndifficulties and strategies for coping with them, evidence of guilt or\r\nempathy, orientation to the criminal label, relationships with family\r\nand friends, handling problems and affectivity, use of alcohol and\r\ndrugs, and experiences with work and school. For the follow-up, the\r\nvarious types of assessment activities were periodically conducted for\r\nsix months or until the inmate's release date, if the inmate was\r\nrequired to serve less than six months. Data collected at follow-up\r\ncame from surveys of inmates, official reports of disciplinary\r\ninfractions or victimizations, and prison staff assessments of\r\ninmates' prison adjustment and work performance. The follow-up surveys\r\ncollected information on inmates' participation in treatment and\r\neducational programs, work absenteeism, health, victimization\r\nexperiences and threats, awards, participation in aggressive,\r\nthreatening, or other illegal activities, contact with family and\r\nfriends, communication strategies, stress, sources of stress, and\r\nattitudes and beliefs about crime and imprisonment. Follow-up ratings\r\nby prison staff characterized the inmates on several clinical scales,\r\naccording to each rater's global assessment of the interviewee. These\r\ncharacteristics included concern for others, role-taking abilities,\r\nassertiveness, inmate's relations with other inmates, authorities, and\r\nstaff, verbal and physical aggressiveness, emotional control under\r\nstress, cooperativeness, need for supervision, response to\r\nsupervision, maturity, behavior toward other inmates, and behavior\r\ntoward staff.",

The\r\nclassification systems tested were Warren's Interpersonal Maturity\r\nLevel (I-level), Quay Adult Internal Management Systems (AIMS),\r\nJesness Inventory, Megargee's MMPI-Based Prison Typology, and Hunt's\r\nConceptual Level. The study sought to answer the following questions:\r\n(a) Which psychological classification systems or combination of\r\nsystems could be used most effectively with adult populations? (b)\r\nWhat procedures (e.g., interview, paper-and-pencil test, staff\r\nassessment, or combination) would assure maximum efficiency without\r\ncompromising psychometric precision? (c) What could the commonalities\r\nand differences among the systems reveal about the specific systems\r\nand about general classification issues pertinent to this population?\r\nand (d) How could the systems better portray the prison experience?\r\nThe penitentiary was a low-maximum-security facility and the prison\r\ncamp was a minimum-security one. A total of 179 penitentiary inmates\r\nand 190 camp inmates participated. The study employed both a pre-post\r\nand a correlational design.

It was\r\n designed to test the hypothesis that the strength of legal protection\r\n for victims' rights has a measurable impact on how victims are treated\r\n by the criminal justice system and on their perceptions of the\r\n system. A related hypothesis was that victims from states with strong\r\n legal protection would have more favorable experiences and greater\r\n satisfaction with the system than those from states where legal\r\n protection is weak. The Victim Survey (Parts 1, 4-7) collected\r\n information on when and where the crime occurred, characteristics of\r\n the perpetrators, use of force, police response, victim services, type\r\n of information given to the victim by the criminal justice system, the\r\n victim's level of participation in the criminal justice system, how\r\n the case ended, sentencing and restitution, the victim's satisfaction\r\n with the criminal justice system, and the effects of the crime on the\r\n victim. Demographic variables in the file include age, race, sex,\r\n education, employment, and income. In addition to the victim survey,\r\n criminal justice and victim assistance professionals at the state and\r\n local levels were surveyed because these professionals affect crime\r\n victims' ability to recover from and cope with the aftermath of the\r\n offense and the stress of participation in the criminal justice\r\n system. The Survey of State Officials (Parts 2 and 8) collected data\r\n on officials' opinions of the criminal justice system, level of\r\n funding for the agency, types of victims' rights provided by the\r\n state, how victims' rights provisions had changed the criminal justice\r\n system, advantages and disadvantages of such legislation, and\r\n recommendations for future legislation. The Survey of Local Officials\r\n (Parts 3 and 9) collected data on officials' opinions of the criminal\r\n justice system, level of funding, victims' rights to information about\r\n and participation in the criminal justice process, victim impact\r\nstatements, and restitution.",

It was\r\n designed to test the hypothesis that the strength of legal protection\r\n for victims' rights has a measurable impact on how victims are treated\r\n by the criminal justice system and on their perceptions of the\r\n system. A related hypothesis was that victims from states with strong\r\n legal protection would have more favorable experiences and greater\r\n satisfaction with the system than those from states where legal\r\n protection is weak. The Victim Survey (Parts 1, 4-7) collected\r\n information on when and where the crime occurred, characteristics of\r\n the perpetrators, use of force, police response, victim services, type\r\n of information given to the victim by the criminal justice system, the\r\n victim's level of participation in the criminal justice system, how\r\n the case ended, sentencing and restitution, the victim's satisfaction\r\n with the criminal justice system, and the effects of the crime on the\r\n victim. Demographic variables in the file include age, race, sex,\r\n education, employment, and income. In addition to the victim survey,\r\n criminal justice and victim assistance professionals at the state and\r\n local levels were surveyed because these professionals affect crime\r\n victims' ability to recover from and cope with the aftermath of the\r\n offense and the stress of participation in the criminal justice\r\n system. The Survey of State Officials (Parts 2 and 8) collected data\r\n on officials' opinions of the criminal justice system, level of\r\n funding for the agency, types of victims' rights provided by the\r\n state, how victims' rights provisions had changed the criminal justice\r\n system, advantages and disadvantages of such legislation, and\r\n recommendations for future legislation. The Survey of Local Officials\r\n (Parts 3 and 9) collected data on officials' opinions of the criminal\r\n justice system, level of funding, victims' rights to information about\r\n and participation in the criminal justice process, victim impact\r\nstatements, and restitution.",

It investigated the\r\n patterns of criminal behavior that occurred over ten to fifteen years\r\n for men whose early criminal involvement was serious enough to result\r\n in commitment to California Youth Authority (state-level)\r\n institutions. The main focus of the study was on changes in criminal\r\n behavior as these men moved through their 20s and into their 30s. This\r\n study extended and expanded the follow-up data for the study EARLY\r\n IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC OFFENDER, [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA] (ICPSR\r\n 8226). Half of the sample from the earlier study was used in the\r\n present study, along with smaller samples of adult offenders with no\r\n history of state-level commitments as juveniles. These data allow for\r\n analyses of adult patterns of criminal behavior and the relationship\r\n of the patterns to various explanatory variables. Part 1, Offense\r\n Data, contains arrest information covering the period after parole\r\n from the California Youth Authority through the date of data\r\n collection. Variables include entry and release dates to jail,\r\n prison, or probation, the most serious offense and charge, total\r\n number of offenses for violent, property, and all crimes, and dates of\r\n arrest, offense codes, and number of counts for all arrests.\r\n These arrest data incorporate the arrest data contained in EARLY\r\n IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHRONIC OFFENDER, [1978-1980: CALIFORNIA]\r\n (ICPSR 8226) for all California Youth Authority cases in the current\r\n study. Part 2,\r\n Arrest Data by Age and Year, contains counts of arrest charges by type\r\n of offense (violent or nonviolent) and by age and calendar year. Part\r\n 3, Arrest Data for Specific Offenses, contains counts of more specific\r\n arrest charges for four-year age blocks (from 18 through 30-plus) for\r\n 21 types of offenses, including murder, assault, rape, robbery,\r\n burglary, theft, forgery, arson, and drug possession. Variables\r\n include months of street time, months of incarceration, and total\r\n arrests. Part 4, Prison and Probation Data, contains information on\r\n prison or probation terms and arrest and lifestyle characteristics for\r\n the year immediately prior to and following jail or prison. Variables\r\n include family criminal history, family life, education, entry and\r\n release dates, offenses, treatment and training while incarcerated,\r\n gang affiliation, psychological evaluation, drug use, employment\r\n history, and marital status. Part 5, Social History Data, contains\r\n lifestyle characteristics by age and year. Variables include drug and\r\n alcohol use, marital status, living arrangements, and employment\r\nhistory.

The study compared the self-reported job tasks of\r\n police officers in 1981 to those in 1996 to determine if job tasks had\r\n changed over time, if they differed between officers in departments\r\n pursuing community policing, or if they differed between officers\r\n assigned as \"community policing\" officers and those having more\r\n traditional assignments. The 1981 Ohio Peace Officer Task Analysis\r\n Survey was conducted to measure police officer tasks. A total of 1,989\r\n police officers from over 300 Ohio police agencies responded to that\r\n survey. Recognizing that community policing had not yet begun to enjoy\r\n popularity when the first sample of officers was questioned in 1981\r\n and that the job of policing and the training needs of peace officers\r\n had changed over the past 15 years, the Ohio Office of Criminal\r\n Justice Services again conducted a task analysis survey of a sample of\r\n police officers throughout the state in 1996. The 1996 survey\r\n instrument included 23 items taken directly from the earlier\r\n survey. These 23 items are the only variables from the 1981 survey\r\n that are included in this dataset, and they form the basis of the\r\n study's comparisons. A total of 1,689 officers from 229 police\r\n departments responded to the 1996 survey. Additionally, while the 1996\r\n Peace Officer Task Analysis survey was in the field, the local police\r\n agencies included in the survey sample were asked to complete a\r\n separate agency survey to determine if they had a community policing\r\n program. A total of 180 departments returned responses to this agency\r\n survey. Background questions for the 1981 and 1996 task analysis\r\n surveys included police officers' age, race, sex, and job\r\n satisfaction. Items concerning police officers' job tasks covered\r\n frequency of conducting field searches of arrested persons,\r\n handcuffing suspects, impounding property, participating in raids,\r\n patrolling on foot, giving street directions, mediating family\r\n disputes, and engaging in school visits. The 1996 agency questionnaire\r\n gathered data on whether the police department had a COP program or a\r\n mission statement that emphasized community involvement, whether the\r\n COP program had an actual implementation date and a full-time\r\n supervisor, whether the respondents were currently assigned as COP\r\n officers, and whether the department's COP officers had had\r\nsupplemental training.",

-            "description": "This study was designed to address the practical and policy\r\nimplications of various drug market participation patterns. In 1995,\r\nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the National\r\nInstitute of Justice (NIJ) collaborated on a project called the\r\nProcurement Study. This study was executed as an addendum to NIJ's\r\nDrug Use Forecasting (DUF) program (DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]) with the goal of\r\nextending previous research in which heroin users were interviewed on\r\nvarious aspects of drug market activity. The present study sought to\r\nexplore additional features of drug market participation and use, both\r\nwithin and across drug types and cities, and included two additional\r\ndrugs -- powder cocaine and crack cocaine. Data were collected from\r\nrecently arrested users of powder cocaine, crack cocaine, and heroin\r\nin six DUF cities (Chicago, New York, Portland, San Diego, San\r\nAntonio, and Washington, DC). Each of the three files in this\r\ncollection, Crack Data (Part 1), Heroin Data (Part 2), and Powder\r\nCocaine Data (Part 3), is comprised of data from a procurement\r\ninterview, urine test variables, and a DUF interview. During the\r\nprocurement interview, information was collected on purchase and use\r\npatterns for specific drugs. Variables from the procurement interview\r\ninclude the respondent's method of using the drug, the term used to\r\nrefer to the drug, whether the respondent bought the drug in the\r\nneighborhood, the number of different dealers the respondent bought\r\nthe drug from, how the respondent made the connection with the dealer\r\n(i.e., street, house, phone, beeper, business/store, or friends),\r\ntheir main drug source, whether the respondent went to someone else if\r\nthe source was not available, how the respondent coped with not being\r\nable to find drugs to buy, whether the respondent got the drug for\r\nfree, the means by which the respondent obtained money, the quantity\r\nand packaging of the drug, and the number of minutes spent searching\r\nfor, traveling to, and waiting for their last purchase. Urine tests\r\nscreened for the presence of ten drugs, including marijuana, opiates,\r\ncocaine, PCP, methadone, benzodiazepines (Valium), methaqualone,\r\npropoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines (positive test\r\nresults for amphetamines were confirmed by gas chromatography). Data\r\nfrom the DUF interview provide detailed information about each\r\narrestee's self-reported use of 15 drugs. For each drug type,\r\narrestees were asked whether they had ever used the drug, the age at\r\nwhich they first used the drug, whether they had used the drug within\r\nthe past three days, how many days they had used the drug within the\r\npast month, whether they had ever needed or felt dependent on the\r\ndrug, and whether they were dependent on the drug at the time of the\r\ninterview. Data from the DUF interview instrument also included\r\nalcohol/drug treatment history, information about whether arrestees\r\nhad ever injected drugs, and whether they were influenced by drugs\r\nwhen the crime that they were charged with was committed. The data\r\nalso include information about whether the arrestee had been to an\r\nemergency room for drug-related incidents and whether he or she had\r\nhad prior arrests in the past 12 months. Demographic data include the\r\nage, race, sex, educational attainment, marital status, employment\r\nstatus, and living circumstances of each respondent.",

In 1995,\r\nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the National\r\nInstitute of Justice (NIJ) collaborated on a project called the\r\nProcurement Study. This study was executed as an addendum to NIJ's\r\nDrug Use Forecasting (DUF) program (DRUG USE FORECASTING IN 24 CITIES\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES, 1987-1997 [ICPSR 9477]) with the goal of\r\nextending previous research in which heroin users were interviewed on\r\nvarious aspects of drug market activity. The present study sought to\r\nexplore additional features of drug market participation and use, both\r\nwithin and across drug types and cities, and included two additional\r\ndrugs -- powder cocaine and crack cocaine. Data were collected from\r\nrecently arrested users of powder cocaine, crack cocaine, and heroin\r\nin six DUF cities (Chicago, New York, Portland, San Diego, San\r\nAntonio, and Washington, DC). Each of the three files in this\r\ncollection, Crack Data (Part 1), Heroin Data (Part 2), and Powder\r\nCocaine Data (Part 3), is comprised of data from a procurement\r\ninterview, urine test variables, and a DUF interview. During the\r\nprocurement interview, information was collected on purchase and use\r\npatterns for specific drugs. Variables from the procurement interview\r\ninclude the respondent's method of using the drug, the term used to\r\nrefer to the drug, whether the respondent bought the drug in the\r\nneighborhood, the number of different dealers the respondent bought\r\nthe drug from, how the respondent made the connection with the dealer\r\n(i.e., street, house, phone, beeper, business/store, or friends),\r\ntheir main drug source, whether the respondent went to someone else if\r\nthe source was not available, how the respondent coped with not being\r\nable to find drugs to buy, whether the respondent got the drug for\r\nfree, the means by which the respondent obtained money, the quantity\r\nand packaging of the drug, and the number of minutes spent searching\r\nfor, traveling to, and waiting for their last purchase. Urine tests\r\nscreened for the presence of ten drugs, including marijuana, opiates,\r\ncocaine, PCP, methadone, benzodiazepines (Valium), methaqualone,\r\npropoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines (positive test\r\nresults for amphetamines were confirmed by gas chromatography). Data\r\nfrom the DUF interview provide detailed information about each\r\narrestee's self-reported use of 15 drugs. For each drug type,\r\narrestees were asked whether they had ever used the drug, the age at\r\nwhich they first used the drug, whether they had used the drug within\r\nthe past three days, how many days they had used the drug within the\r\npast month, whether they had ever needed or felt dependent on the\r\ndrug, and whether they were dependent on the drug at the time of the\r\ninterview. Data from the DUF interview instrument also included\r\nalcohol/drug treatment history, information about whether arrestees\r\nhad ever injected drugs, and whether they were influenced by drugs\r\nwhen the crime that they were charged with was committed. The data\r\nalso include information about whether the arrestee had been to an\r\nemergency room for drug-related incidents and whether he or she had\r\nhad prior arrests in the past 12 months. Demographic data include the\r\nage, race, sex, educational attainment, marital status, employment\r\nstatus, and living circumstances of each respondent.",

A\r\n single, multivariate analysis method was used so that the influence of\r\n each respondent, criminal, crime, and treatment characterististic\r\n could be determined within the context of all other factors. The\r\n research also explored differences between global and specific\r\n attitudes toward rehabilitation. Data for this study were collected\r\n through a mail survey of 1,000 Ohio residents (Part 1). The initial\r\n mailing was sent to all 1,000 members of the sample on May 28,\r\n 1996. Several followups were conducted, and data collection efforts\r\n ended on August 26, 1996. Questionnaire items elicited demographic,\r\n experiential, and attitudinal information from each respondent. To\r\n assess the potential influence of offender, offense, and treatment\r\n characteristics on the respondent's support for rehabilitation,\r\n several variables were combined to create a factorial vignette. This\r\n method allowed the independent effects of each factor on support for\r\n rehabilitation to be determined. The respondents were asked to express\r\n their agreement or disagreement with five statements following the\r\n vignette: (1) general support for rehabilitation, (2) effectiveness of\r\n intervention, (3) basing release decisions on progress in\r\n rehabilitation programs, (4) individualizing sentences to fit\r\n treatment needs, and (5) expanding treatment opportunities for\r\n offenders. Types of offenses included in the vignettes were robbery,\r\n burglary, aggravated assault, larceny, motor vehicle theft, fraud,\r\n drug sales, and drug use. These offenses were selected since they are\r\n well-known to the public, offenders are arrested for these offenses\r\n fairly frequently, and the offenses are potentially punishable by a\r\n sentence of either prison or probation. Several attributes within the\r\n particular offenses in the vignettes were designed to assess the\r\n influence of different levels of harm, either financial or\r\n physical. Offender characteristics and offense selection for use in\r\n the vignettes were weighted by their frequency of arrests as reported\r\n in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 1995 Uniform Crime Report\r\n data. A rating of the seriousness of each offense was assigned using a\r\n separate survey of 118 undergraduate university students (Part 2), and\r\n the resulting seriousness score was used in the analysis of the\r\n vignettes. Additional items on the mail survey instrument assessed the\r\n respondent's global and specific attitudes toward\r\n treatment. Independent variables from the mail survey include the\r\n respondent's age, education, income category, sex, race, political\r\n party, rating of political conservativism, personal contact with\r\n offenders, religious identity salience, religiosity, attitudes toward\r\n biblical literalness and religious forgiveness, fear of crime, and\r\n victimization. Variables from the vignettes examined whether support\r\n for rehabilitation was influenced by offender age, race, sex, type of\r\n offense committed, employment status, substance use, prior record,\r\n sentence, and treatment program. Global support for rehabilitation was\r\n measured by responses to two questions: what the respondent thought\r\n the main emphasis in most prisons was (to punish, to rehabilitate, to\r\n protect society), and what the main emphasis should be. Items assessed\r\n variations in the respondent's attitudes toward rehabilitation by\r\n offender's age, sex, and prior record, location of treatment, and the\r\n type of treatment provided. Variables from the crime seriousness\r\n survey recorded the respondent's rating of various crime events,\r\n including assault and robbery (with or without a weapon, with varying\r\n degrees of injury, or no injury to the victim), burglary, larceny, and\r\n auto theft (with varying values of the property stolen), drug dealing,\r\ndrug use, and writing bad checks.",

The\r\n aim of the study was to describe the jailed population, their needs in\r\n relation to substance abuse and parenting issues, to explore\r\n children's risk factors resulting from having a parent with substance\r\n abuse and/or criminal justice involvement, and ultimately to offer a\r\n point of intervention for parents and children at risk. Participants\r\n included 229 men and 52 women aged 18 and older, who were in their\r\n first 48 hours of incarceration in the Santa Clara County Department\r\n of Corrections in August 2003 and who where voluntary participants in\r\n the National Institute of Justice's (NIJ) Arrestee Drug Abuse\r\n Monitoring (ADAM) Program (ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM)\r\n PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 2003 [ICPSR 4020]). Male subjects were\r\n chosen through a random selection process, while female participants\r\n were taken from a convenience sample. The pilot study used a\r\n questionnaire completed as an addendum to the ADAM program main\r\n interview. Major types of variables included in this study are type\r\n and duration of alcohol/drug use, family history of incarceration,\r\n number and ages of children for whom the respondent was the primary\r\n caregiver, social consequences for the child due to the incarceration\r\n of the respondent, and if the child had any problems with drugs and/or\r\nalcohol.",

The\r\n aim of the study was to describe the jailed population, their needs in\r\n relation to substance abuse and parenting issues, to explore\r\n children's risk factors resulting from having a parent with substance\r\n abuse and/or criminal justice involvement, and ultimately to offer a\r\n point of intervention for parents and children at risk. Participants\r\n included 229 men and 52 women aged 18 and older, who were in their\r\n first 48 hours of incarceration in the Santa Clara County Department\r\n of Corrections in August 2003 and who where voluntary participants in\r\n the National Institute of Justice's (NIJ) Arrestee Drug Abuse\r\n Monitoring (ADAM) Program (ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM)\r\n PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 2003 [ICPSR 4020]). Male subjects were\r\n chosen through a random selection process, while female participants\r\n were taken from a convenience sample. The pilot study used a\r\n questionnaire completed as an addendum to the ADAM program main\r\n interview. Major types of variables included in this study are type\r\n and duration of alcohol/drug use, family history of incarceration,\r\n number and ages of children for whom the respondent was the primary\r\n caregiver, social consequences for the child due to the incarceration\r\n of the respondent, and if the child had any problems with drugs and/or\r\nalcohol.",

The first, the Crossroad to Freedom House\r\nTherapeutic Community at the Arrowhead Correctional Center (ACC TC)\r\nwas a prison-based program. The second was the community-based Peer I\r\nTherapeutic Community (Peer I). Two methodologies were used to gather\r\ndata. Part 1, RSAT Outcome Data, contains quantitative data collected\r\nfrom five separate study groups of differing sample sizes that\r\nreceived differing levels of treatment, with a total of 778 cases. The\r\ngroups were compared on five separate outcome variables: technical\r\nviolation, new misdemeanor arrest, new felony arrest, return to\r\nprison, and overall supervision failure. To gather baseline\r\ninformation from participants, a researcher administered the intake\r\npacket in group format to participants within three weeks of admission\r\nto ACC TC. After completing the treatment programs, outcome data were\r\ncollected for a two-year follow-up period for each participant. Part\r\n2, Case Studies, consists of case studies of ten participants, two\r\nfrom each of the above five listed groups. One from each group had\r\nsuccessful outcomes, and one did not. Successful outcomes were defined\r\nas participants who were still living in the community after 12 to 18\r\nmonths without any new charges. Unsuccessful outcomes were defined as\r\nthose participants who were returned to prison for technical\r\nviolations or new charges and were eligible for study only if they had\r\nbeen living in the community for six to twelve months before returning\r\nto prison. Information for the case studies were gathered through\r\ninterviews with both former prisoners and one of their significant\r\nothers. Variables for Part 1 include demographic information, length\r\nof stay in both the ACC TC and Peer I, types of programs parolees were\r\nreleased to, and time period between leaving the Department of\r\nCorrections and any subsequent returns. Information was also gathered\r\non the presence of psychological concerns as an adult, as well as in\r\nchildhood. Part 2 consists of information regarding ACC TC and Peer I\r\nparticipants' post-treatment such as their employment status,\r\nfinancial well-being, significant relationships, relapse information\r\nand whether or not the interviewee has returned to the Department of\r\nCorrections since receiving treatment and being released.",

The project used data from the National Survey of Child and\r\nAdolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a national probability survey of\r\nchildren assessed following a child maltreatment report. This\r\ncollection consists of SAS code used to produce subsets of the NSCAW\r\ndata and the analyses for three chapters of the project's final\r\nreport. Chapter 2 examined aggression and changes in behavior over 18\r\nmonths for children aged six to ten years at the time of the baseline\r\ninterview. Chapter 3 examined self-reported delinquency and\r\ncaregiver-reported aggressive and delinquent behavior and changes in\r\nbehavior over 18 months for youth aged 11 to 15 years at the time of\r\nthe baseline interview.

This\r\ncollection consists of SAS code used to produce subsets of the NSCAW\r\ndata and the analyses for three chapters of the project's final\r\nreport. Chapter 2 examined aggression and changes in behavior over 18\r\nmonths for children aged six to ten years at the time of the baseline\r\ninterview. Chapter 3 examined self-reported delinquency and\r\ncaregiver-reported aggressive and delinquent behavior and changes in\r\nbehavior over 18 months for youth aged 11 to 15 years at the time of\r\nthe baseline interview. Chapter 4 examined risky behavior changes\r\n(risky sexual behavior, substance abuse, and suicidal risk behavior)\r\nover 18 months for youth aged 11 to 15 years at the time of the\r\nbaseline interview.",

The random assignment was made at sentencing, after\r\nall parties (judge, prosecutor, and defense) had agreed that batterer\r\ntreatment was appropriate, the defendant agreed to treatment and was\r\naccepted by the Alternatives to Violence (ATV) program, and the\r\nprogram was available based on the random assignment process.\r\nInterviews were also conducted with both the batterer and the victim\r\nat sentencing as well as 6 months post-sentence and 12 months\r\npost-sentence. These interviews collected data in areas regarding\r\ndemographics (first interview only), recidivism, beliefs about\r\ndomestic violence, conflict management strategies, locus of control,\r\nand for victims, self esteem. Administrative records were also used to\r\nobtain data regarding any new crimes committed.",

More specifically, it \r\n provides information on how sexual abuse and the subsequent judicial \r\n processes affect the mental health functioning of child victims by \r\n assessing the impact of (1) additional harm to victims from out-of-home \r\n placement, (2) criminal prosecution of the offender/family member, (3) \r\n subject testimony in juvenile or criminal court, and (4) family and \r\n professional support for the children. Children were enrolled in the \r\n study at the time that social services personnel substantiated claims \r\n of sexual abuse, and they were followed for a period of 18 months. \r\n Assessments of the mental health functioning of the children were made \r\n at the time of initial investigation, five months later, and 18 months \r\n later, using a combination of self-reports, parent and teacher reports, \r\n and psychological tests. After obtaining informed consent from the \r\n parent or guardian, each child was interviewed using a structured \r\n psychiatric inventory. The specific impacts of the various judicial \r\n processes or interventions under study were examined through \r\n comparisons of subgroups of the sample that did and did not experience \r\n particular interventions. The interventions included social services \r\n investigation, court process, foster placement, and psychological \r\n therapy. Other information in the file includes the type of sexual \r\n abuse experienced, judicial interventions the child experienced, and \r\n the child's level of depression, anxiety, and social adjustment. \r\nDemographic variables include age, sex, and race.",

Children were enrolled in the \r\n study at the time that social services personnel substantiated claims \r\n of sexual abuse, and they were followed for a period of 18 months. \r\n Assessments of the mental health functioning of the children were made \r\n at the time of initial investigation, five months later, and 18 months \r\n later, using a combination of self-reports, parent and teacher reports, \r\n and psychological tests. After obtaining informed consent from the \r\n parent or guardian, each child was interviewed using a structured \r\n psychiatric inventory. The specific impacts of the various judicial \r\n processes or interventions under study were examined through \r\n comparisons of subgroups of the sample that did and did not experience \r\n particular interventions. The interventions included social services \r\n investigation, court process, foster placement, and psychological \r\n therapy. Other information in the file includes the type of sexual \r\n abuse experienced, judicial interventions the child experienced, and \r\n the child's level of depression, anxiety, and social adjustment. \r\nDemographic variables include age, sex, and race.",

From these interviews, investigators identified three distinct patterns of survivors' post-assault disclosures and their pathways to seeking help from SANE programs and the criminal justice system: voluntary (survivors' contact with the legal and medical system was by their choice), involuntary (system contact was not by choice), and situational (circumstances of the assault itself prompted involuntary disclosure). Interviews included responses that described the assault, their experience with both the SANE/SART programs and the criminal justice system, and victim and offender demographic information. \r\nIn Dataset 2 (SANE Programs Quantitative Data), investigators obtained SANE program records, police and prosecutor records, and crime lab findings for a sample of N=395 (ages 13-17) adolescent sexual assault victims who sought services from the local SANE programs in two different counties. The data collected examined victim's progress through the criminal justice system. Factors that could potentially affect case progression were also examined; age of victim, relationship to offender, assault characteristics, number of assaults on victim, and evidence collected.

The study examined crime displacement and potential diffusion of benefits in and around five public housing developments that, since 2000, had been redeveloped using funds from HUD's HOPE VI initiative and other sources. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, three sites were selected for inclusion in the study. However, due to substantial overlap between the various target sites and displacement zones, the research team ultimately decided to aggregate the three sites into a single target area. A comparison area was then chosen based on recommendations from the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM). In Washington, DC, two HOPE VI sites were selected for inclusion in the study. Based on recommendations from the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), the research team selected a comparison site for each of the two target areas. Displacement areas were then drawn as concentric rings (\"buffers\") around the target areas in both Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Address-level incident data were collected for the city of Milwaukee from the Milwaukee Police Department for the period January 2002 through February 2010. Incident data included all \"Group A\" offenses as classified under National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The research team classified the offenses into personal and property offenses. The offenses were aggregated into monthly counts, yielding 98 months of data (Part 1: Milwaukee, Wisconsin Data). Address-level data were also collected for Washington, DC from the Metropolitan Police Department for the time period January 2000 through September 2009. Incident data included all Part I offenses as classified under the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system. The data were classified by researchers into personal and property offenses and aggregated by month, yielding 117 months of data (Part 2: Washington, DC Data). Part 1 contains 15 variables, while Part 2 contains a total of 27 variables. Both datasets include variables on the number of personal offenses reported per month, the number of property offenses reported per month, and the total number of incidents reported per month for each target site, buffer zone area (1000 feet or 2000 feet), and comparison site. Month and year indicators are also included in each dataset.",

The study examined intra- and interagency dynamics associated with SAK processing efficiency in a linked sample of crime laboratories. SAK outputs and inputs were assessed for laboratories that conduct biological forensic analysis and LEAs that submit SAK evidence to these laboratories. Production functions were estimated to examine effects of labor and capital inputs, in addition to policies, management systems, and cross-agency coordination on efficiency. Six jurisdictions were recruited for site visits, and qualitative methods were used to understand how LEAs, laboratories, and prosecutors implement practices that affect efficiency.This study contains 7 data files including:Crime Lab_Raw.dta (n=147; variables =242)Crosswalk File.dta (n=2337; variables=2)lab_analysis_sample_2017-04-06.dta (n=132; variables=92)LEA Communication LCAs.dta (n=321; variables=15merged_analysis_file_JH2017-04-30.dta (n=273; variables=117)policy Class probabilities_LABS.dta (n=139; variables=19)SAK LAB COMMUNICATION LCA.dta (n=134; variables=15)",

The study examined intra- and interagency dynamics associated with SAK processing efficiency in a linked sample of crime laboratories. SAK outputs and inputs were assessed for laboratories that conduct biological forensic analysis and LEAs that submit SAK evidence to these laboratories. Production functions were estimated to examine effects of labor and capital inputs, in addition to policies, management systems, and cross-agency coordination on efficiency. Six jurisdictions were recruited for site visits, and qualitative methods were used to understand how LEAs, laboratories, and prosecutors implement practices that affect efficiency.This study contains 7 data files including:Crime Lab_Raw.dta (n=147; variables =242)Crosswalk File.dta (n=2337; variables=2)lab_analysis_sample_2017-04-06.dta (n=132; variables=92)LEA Communication LCAs.dta (n=321; variables=15merged_analysis_file_JH2017-04-30.dta (n=273; variables=117)policy Class probabilities_LABS.dta (n=139; variables=19)SAK LAB COMMUNICATION LCA.dta (n=134; variables=15)",

The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\n\r\nThe research project has tested a possible explanation for the Great American Crime Decline of the 1990s and especially 2000s: the increasing rates at which psychotropic drugs are prescribed, especially to children and adolescents. Psychotropic drugs are often prescribed to youth for mental health conditions that involve disruptive and impulsive behaviors and learning difficulties. The effects of these drugs are thus expected to lead to the decrease in the juveniles' involvement in delinquency and violence.\r\nThe effects of two legislative changes are hypothesized to have contributed to the increased prescribing of psychotropic drugs to children growing up in families in poverty: 1) changes in eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that made it possible for poor children to qualify for additional financial assistance due to mental health conditions (1990 and 1996), and 2) changes in school accountability rules following the passage of No Child Left Behind Act (2002) that put pressure on schools in some low-income areas to qualify academically challenged students as having ADHD or other learning disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are: 1) to assemble a data set, using state-level data from various publicly available sources, containing information about trends in juvenile delinquency and violence, trends in psychotropic drug prescribing to children and adolescents, and various control variables associated with these two sets of trends; 2) to test the proposed hypotheses about the effect of increasing psychotropic medication prescribing to children and adolescents on juvenile delinquency and violence, using the assembled data set; and 3) to disseminate the scientific knowledge gained through this study among criminal justice researchers, psychiatric and public health scientists, as well as among a wider audience of practitioners and the general public.\r\nThis collection includes one SPSS file (Dataset_NIJ_GRANT_2014-R2-CX-0003_DV-IV_3-29-17.sav; n=1,275, 113 variables) and one Word syntax file (doc36775-0001_syntax.docx).",

Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.\r\n\r\nThe research project has tested a possible explanation for the Great American Crime Decline of the 1990s and especially 2000s: the increasing rates at which psychotropic drugs are prescribed, especially to children and adolescents. Psychotropic drugs are often prescribed to youth for mental health conditions that involve disruptive and impulsive behaviors and learning difficulties. The effects of these drugs are thus expected to lead to the decrease in the juveniles' involvement in delinquency and violence.\r\nThe effects of two legislative changes are hypothesized to have contributed to the increased prescribing of psychotropic drugs to children growing up in families in poverty: 1) changes in eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that made it possible for poor children to qualify for additional financial assistance due to mental health conditions (1990 and 1996), and 2) changes in school accountability rules following the passage of No Child Left Behind Act (2002) that put pressure on schools in some low-income areas to qualify academically challenged students as having ADHD or other learning disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are: 1) to assemble a data set, using state-level data from various publicly available sources, containing information about trends in juvenile delinquency and violence, trends in psychotropic drug prescribing to children and adolescents, and various control variables associated with these two sets of trends; 2) to test the proposed hypotheses about the effect of increasing psychotropic medication prescribing to children and adolescents on juvenile delinquency and violence, using the assembled data set; and 3) to disseminate the scientific knowledge gained through this study among criminal justice researchers, psychiatric and public health scientists, as well as among a wider audience of practitioners and the general public.\r\nThis collection includes one SPSS file (Dataset_NIJ_GRANT_2014-R2-CX-0003_DV-IV_3-29-17.sav; n=1,275, 113 variables) and one Word syntax file (doc36775-0001_syntax.docx).",

The purpose of this study was to test a modified version of the SRQ that asked women to report separately on social reactions from criminal justice personnel, community-based providers, and informal supports. The researchers sought to examine changes in social reactions longitudinally as well as the impact of social reactions on criminal justice engagement and post-traumatic distress among diverse women following a recent sexual assault. The study included testing hypotheses about the inter-relationships among social reactions, victim well-being (e.g., psychological distress), and criminal justice variables (e.g., victim engagement with prosecution). Addressing the dearth of longitudinal research on social reactions, this study examined causal links among variables. In particular, researchers tested hypotheses about changes in social reactions over time in relation to criminal justice cases and victims' post-traumatic reactions.\r\nThe data included as part of this collection includes one SPSS data file (2_1-Data_Quantiative-Variables-Updated-20180611.sav) with 3,310 variables for 228 cases.

Violence Against Women grants were intended \"to\r\n assist states, Indian tribal governments, and units of local\r\n government to develop and strengthen effective law enforcement and\r\n prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes against women, and to\r\n develop and strengthen victim services in cases involving violent\r\n crimes against women.\" Domestic violence and sexual assault were\r\n identified as primary targets for the STOP grants, along with support\r\n for under-served victim populations. Two types of programs were\r\n sampled in this evaluation. The first was a sample of representatives\r\n of STOP grant programs, from which 62 interviews were completed (Part\r\n 1, Criminal Justice Victim Service Program Survey Data). The second\r\n was a sample of 96 representatives of programs that worked in close\r\n cooperation with the 62 STOP program grantees to serve victims (Part\r\n 2, Ancillary Programs Survey Data). General questions from the STOP\r\n program survey (Part 1) covered types of victims served, years program\r\n had been in existence, types of services provided, stages when\r\n services were provided, number of victims served by the program the\r\n previous year, the program's operating budget, and primary and\r\n secondary funding sources. Questions about the community in which the\r\n program operated focused on types of services for domestic violence\r\n and/or sexual assault victims that existed in the community, if\r\n services provided by the program complemented or overlapped those\r\n provided by the community, and a rating of the community's coordinated\r\n response in providing services. Questions specific to the activities\r\n supported by the STOP grant included the amount of the grant award, if\r\n the STOP grant was used to start the program or to expand services and\r\n if the latter, which services, and whether the STOP funds changed the\r\n way the program delivered services, changed linkages with other\r\n agencies in the community, increased the program's visibility in the\r\n community, and/or impacted the program's stability. Also included were\r\n questions about under-served populations being served by the program,\r\n the impact of the STOP grant on victims as individuals and on their\r\n cases in the criminal justice system, and the program's impact on\r\n domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault victims throughout the\r\n community. Data from the ancillary programs survey (Part 2) pertain to\r\n types of services provided by the program, if the organization was\r\n part of the private sector or the criminal justice system, and the\r\n impact of the STOP program in the community on various aspects of\r\nservices provided and on improvements for victims.",

-            "description": "This study examined differences in criminal career\r\n parameters that determine the potential incapacitative effects of\r\n alternative sentencing policies directed at drug-involved\r\n offenders. In particular, the researchers explored three key aspects\r\n of offenders' criminal careers: participation, frequency of offending,\r\n and termination rates from active offending. The study focused on\r\n differences in levels of serious offending by drug-using and nonusing\r\n drug offenders compared to drug-using and nonusing predatory\r\n offenders. Longitudinal arrest data for a sample of arrestees were\r\n collected to characterize the offending patterns of drug-using and\r\n nonusing drug offenders and predatory offenders. The sample was drawn\r\n from adults arrested in Washington, DC, on any charge from July 1,\r\n 1985, to June 30, 1986. Data were collected from case files maintained\r\n by the Washington, DC, Pretrial Services Agency for 883 arrestees and\r\n 5,387 arrests. Previous and subsequent arrests of the same individual\r\n were linked to form an arrest history. Within the sample of arrestees,\r\n three main types of offenders were distinguished based on offense\r\n charge at target arrest: (1) drug offenders, (2) predatory offenders\r\n (persons charged with robbery or burglary), and (3) all others. This\r\n study focused on the first two groups and distinguished drug users\r\n from non-users based on the results of a urine drug screen\r\n administered following the target arrest. Variables regarding arrests\r\n include date of arrest, drug test result, charges filed, disposition\r\n date, disposition type, and sentence length imposed. Demographic\r\nvariables include race, sex, and place of birth.",

In particular, the researchers explored three key aspects\r\n of offenders' criminal careers: participation, frequency of offending,\r\n and termination rates from active offending. The study focused on\r\n differences in levels of serious offending by drug-using and nonusing\r\n drug offenders compared to drug-using and nonusing predatory\r\n offenders. Longitudinal arrest data for a sample of arrestees were\r\n collected to characterize the offending patterns of drug-using and\r\n nonusing drug offenders and predatory offenders. The sample was drawn\r\n from adults arrested in Washington, DC, on any charge from July 1,\r\n 1985, to June 30, 1986. Data were collected from case files maintained\r\n by the Washington, DC, Pretrial Services Agency for 883 arrestees and\r\n 5,387 arrests. Previous and subsequent arrests of the same individual\r\n were linked to form an arrest history. Within the sample of arrestees,\r\n three main types of offenders were distinguished based on offense\r\n charge at target arrest: (1) drug offenders, (2) predatory offenders\r\n (persons charged with robbery or burglary), and (3) all others. This\r\n study focused on the first two groups and distinguished drug users\r\n from non-users based on the results of a urine drug screen\r\n administered following the target arrest. Variables regarding arrests\r\n include date of arrest, drug test result, charges filed, disposition\r\n date, disposition type, and sentence length imposed. Demographic\r\nvariables include race, sex, and place of birth.",

The Brooklyn DTAP was selected for\r\nstudy because of the program's uniquely coercive program components,\r\nincluding the threat of a mandatory prison term for noncompliance.\r\nThe goals of this project were (1) to test whether DTAP participants\r\nwould show significantly higher retention rates when compared to a\r\nmatched sample of other legally-mandated treatment clients, and (2)\r\nto assess the role of perceived legal pressure in predicting\r\nretention for both of these groups. Data were collected from program\r\nparticipants through interviews conducted at admission to treatment\r\nand follow-up interviews conducted about eight weeks later. Intake\r\ninterviews were conducted, on average, one week after the client's\r\nadmission to treatment. The one-to-one interviews, which lasted up to\r\ntwo hours, were administered by trained researchers in a private\r\nlocation at the treatment site.

-            "description": "This study was undertaken to obtain information on the\r\n characteristics of gun ownership, gun-carrying practices, and\r\n weapons-related incidents in the United States -- specifically, gun\r\n use and other weapons used in self-defense against humans and animals.\r\n Data were gathered using a national random-digit-dial telephone\r\n survey. The respondents were comprised of 1,905 randomly-selected\r\n adults aged 18 and older living in the 50 United States. All\r\n interviews were completed between May 28 and July 2, 1996. The sample\r\n was designed to be a representative sample of households, not of\r\n individuals, so researchers did not interview more than one adult from\r\n each household. To start the interview, six qualifying questions were\r\n asked, dealing with (1) gun ownership, (2) gun-carrying practices, (3)\r\n gun display against the respondent, (4) gun use in self-defense\r\n against animals, (5) gun use in self-defense against people, and (6)\r\n other weapons used in self-defense. A \"yes\" response to a qualifying\r\n question led to a series of additional questions on the same topic as\r\n the qualifying question. Part 1, Survey Data, contains the coded data\r\n obtained during the interviews, and Part 2, Open-Ended-Verbatim\r\n Responses, consists of the answers to open-ended questions provided by\r\n the respondents. Information collected for Part 1 covers how many\r\n firearms were owned by household members, types of firearms owned\r\n (handguns, revolvers, pistols, fully automatic weapons, and assault\r\n weapons), whether the respondent personally owned a gun, reasons for\r\n owning a gun, type of gun carried, whether the gun was ever kept\r\n loaded, kept concealed, used for personal protection, or used for\r\n work, and whether the respondent had a permit to carry the\r\n gun. Additional questions focused on incidents in which a gun was\r\n displayed in a hostile manner against the respondent, including the\r\n number of times such an incident took place, the location of the event\r\n in which the gun was displayed against the respondent, whether the\r\n police were contacted, whether the individual displaying the gun was\r\n known to the respondent, whether the incident was a burglary, robbery,\r\n or other planned assault, and the number of shots fired during the\r\n incident. Variables concerning gun use by the respondent in\r\n self-defense against an animal include the number of times the\r\n respondent used a gun in this manner and whether the respondent was\r\n hunting at the time of the incident. Other variables in Part 1 deal\r\n with gun use in self-defense against people, such as the location of\r\n the event, if the other individual knew the respondent had a gun, the\r\n type of gun used, any injuries to the respondent or to the individual\r\n that required medical attention or hospitalization, whether the\r\n incident was reported to the police, whether there were any arrests,\r\n whether other weapons were used in self-defense, the type of other\r\n weapon used, location of the incident in which the other weapon was\r\n used, and whether the respondent was working as a police officer or\r\n security guard or was in the military at the time of the\r\n event. Demographic variables in Part 1 include the gender, race, age,\r\n household income, and type of community (city, suburb, or rural) in\r\n which the respondent lived. Open-ended questions asked during the\r\n interview comprise the variables in Part 2. Responses include\r\n descriptions of where the respondent was when he or she displayed a\r\n gun (in self-defense or otherwise), specific reasons why the\r\n respondent displayed a gun, how the other individual reacted when the\r\n respondent displayed the gun, how the individual knew the respondent\r\n had a gun, whether the police were contacted for specific self-defense\r\nevents, and if not, why not.",

The respondents were comprised of 1,905 randomly-selected\r\n adults aged 18 and older living in the 50 United States. All\r\n interviews were completed between May 28 and July 2, 1996. The sample\r\n was designed to be a representative sample of households, not of\r\n individuals, so researchers did not interview more than one adult from\r\n each household. To start the interview, six qualifying questions were\r\n asked, dealing with (1) gun ownership, (2) gun-carrying practices, (3)\r\n gun display against the respondent, (4) gun use in self-defense\r\n against animals, (5) gun use in self-defense against people, and (6)\r\n other weapons used in self-defense. A \"yes\" response to a qualifying\r\n question led to a series of additional questions on the same topic as\r\n the qualifying question. Part 1, Survey Data, contains the coded data\r\n obtained during the interviews, and Part 2, Open-Ended-Verbatim\r\n Responses, consists of the answers to open-ended questions provided by\r\n the respondents. Information collected for Part 1 covers how many\r\n firearms were owned by household members, types of firearms owned\r\n (handguns, revolvers, pistols, fully automatic weapons, and assault\r\n weapons), whether the respondent personally owned a gun, reasons for\r\n owning a gun, type of gun carried, whether the gun was ever kept\r\n loaded, kept concealed, used for personal protection, or used for\r\n work, and whether the respondent had a permit to carry the\r\n gun. Additional questions focused on incidents in which a gun was\r\n displayed in a hostile manner against the respondent, including the\r\n number of times such an incident took place, the location of the event\r\n in which the gun was displayed against the respondent, whether the\r\n police were contacted, whether the individual displaying the gun was\r\n known to the respondent, whether the incident was a burglary, robbery,\r\n or other planned assault, and the number of shots fired during the\r\n incident. Variables concerning gun use by the respondent in\r\n self-defense against an animal include the number of times the\r\n respondent used a gun in this manner and whether the respondent was\r\n hunting at the time of the incident. Other variables in Part 1 deal\r\n with gun use in self-defense against people, such as the location of\r\n the event, if the other individual knew the respondent had a gun, the\r\n type of gun used, any injuries to the respondent or to the individual\r\n that required medical attention or hospitalization, whether the\r\n incident was reported to the police, whether there were any arrests,\r\n whether other weapons were used in self-defense, the type of other\r\n weapon used, location of the incident in which the other weapon was\r\n used, and whether the respondent was working as a police officer or\r\n security guard or was in the military at the time of the\r\n event. Demographic variables in Part 1 include the gender, race, age,\r\n household income, and type of community (city, suburb, or rural) in\r\n which the respondent lived. Open-ended questions asked during the\r\n interview comprise the variables in Part 2. Responses include\r\n descriptions of where the respondent was when he or she displayed a\r\n gun (in self-defense or otherwise), specific reasons why the\r\n respondent displayed a gun, how the other individual reacted when the\r\n respondent displayed the gun, how the individual knew the respondent\r\n had a gun, whether the police were contacted for specific self-defense\r\nevents, and if not, why not.",

A\r\n related goal was to discern trends, variations, and expansion of CPTED\r\n principles traditionally employed in crime prevention and\r\n deterrence. \"Security by design\" stems from the theory that proper\r\n design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a\r\n reduction in the incidence and fear of crime and an improvement in\r\n quality of life. Examples are improving street lighting in high-crime\r\n locations, traffic re-routing and control to hamper drug trafficking\r\n and other crimes, inclusion of security provisions in city building\r\n codes, and comprehensive review of planned development to ensure\r\n careful consideration of security. To gather these data, the United\r\n States Conference of Mayors (USCM), which had previously studied a\r\n variety of issues including the fear of crime, mailed a survey to the\r\n mayors of 1,060 cities in 1994. Follow-up surveys were sent in 1995\r\n and 1996. The surveys gathered information about the role of CPTED in\r\n a variety of local government policies and procedures, local\r\n ordinances, and regulations relating to building, local development,\r\n and zoning. Information was also collected on processes that offered\r\n opportunities for integrating CPTED principles into local development\r\n or redevelopment and the incorporation of CPTED into decisions about\r\n the location, design, and management of public facilities. Questions\r\n focused on whether the city used CPTED principles, which CPTED\r\n techniques were used (architectural features, landscaping and\r\n landscape materials, land-use planning, physical security devices,\r\n traffic circulation systems, or other), the city department with\r\n primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with CPTED zoning\r\n ordinances/building codes and other departments that actively\r\n participated in that enforcement (mayor's office, fire department,\r\n public works department, planning department, city manager, economic\r\n development office, police department, building department, parks and\r\n recreation, zoning department, city attorney, community development\r\n office, or other), the review process for proposed development,\r\n security measures for public facilities, traffic diversion and\r\n control, and urban beautification programs. Respondents were also\r\n asked about other security-by-design features being used, including\r\n whether they were mandatory or optional, if optional, how they were\r\n instituted (legislation, regulation, state building code, or other),\r\n and if applicable, how they were legislated (city ordinance, city\r\n resolution, or state law). Information was also collected on the\r\n perceived effectiveness of each technique, if local development\r\n regulations existed regarding convenience stores, if joint code\r\n enforcement was in place, if banks, neighborhood groups, private\r\n security agencies, or other groups were involved in the traffic\r\n diversion and control program, and the responding city's population,\r\nper capita income, and form of government.",

Based on the\r\nfact that each attack by a mentally disordered person in which an\r\nAmerican public figure was wounded had occurred in connection with a\r\nphysical approach within 100 yards, the investigators reasoned that\r\naccurate predictions of such physical approaches could serve as\r\nproxies for the less feasible task of accurate prediction of attacks.\r\nThe investigators used information from case files of subjects who had\r\npursued two groups of public figures, politicians and celebrities. The\r\ndata were drawn from the records of the United States Capitol Police\r\nand a prominent Los Angeles-based security consulting firm, Gavin de\r\nBecker, Inc. Information was gathered from letters and other\r\ncommunications of the subjects, as well as any other sources\r\navailable, such as police records or descriptions of what occurred\r\nduring interviews. The data include demographic information such as\r\nsex, age, race, marital status, religion, and education, family\r\nhistory information, background information such as school and work\r\nrecords, military history, criminal history, number of communications\r\nmade, number of threats made, information about subjects' physical\r\nappearance, psychological and emotional evaluations, information on\r\ntravel/mobility patterns, and approaches made.",

This research used an\r\nextensive longitudinal database collected on 1,345 young adult male\r\noffenders admitted to the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in\r\nTallahassee, Florida, from November 3, 1970, to November 2, 1972.\r\nUsing FBI arrest records (\"rap sheets\"), each inmate was classified\r\non the basis of the National Crime Information Center Uniform Offense\r\nCodes into one of four distinct categories: (1) \"angry violent,\" in\r\nwhich the apparent goal was to injure the victim, (2) \"instrumentally\r\nviolent,\" in which the aggressive behavior was a means to an end (as\r\nin a robbery), (3) \"potentially violent,\" as evidenced by making\r\nthreats or carrying weapons but in which the offender was not accused\r\nof any violent offenses, and (4) \"nonviolent,\" in which the offender\r\nhad not been charged with violent criminal behavior. Violent offenders\r\nwere also subdivided into those who had been repetitively violent and\r\nthose who had been charged with just one violent offense. As part of\r\nthe classification process, each inmate was administered an extensive\r\nbattery of tests by the research project staff. The two primary\r\npersonality assessment instruments utilized were the Minnesota\r\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the California\r\nPsychological Inventory (CPI). Each inmate's caseworker filled out a\r\nseries of of standard Bureau of Prisons forms recording the results of\r\nthe medical, educational, and psychological evaluations, as well as\r\nsalient aspects of the case and criminal history. The researchers also\r\nobtained copies of each offender's Presentence Investigation Report\r\n(PSI) that had been prepared by the federal probation officer, and\r\nthen devised a series of scales to quantify the PSI data. In addition,\r\nan hour-long structured intake interview was administered to each\r\ninmate by his team psychologist. Global scales were constructed from\r\nthese intake interviews. After each interview, the psychologists\r\nperformed an evaluative Q-sort. Nine scales were later constructed\r\nbased on these Q-sorts. Also, every dormitory officer and every work\r\nsupervisor completed scales assessing each subject's interpersonal\r\nadjustment and work performance at 90-day intervals. Immediately prior\r\nto release, as many inmates as possible were reinterviewed and\r\nretested on the MMPI and the CPI. Follow-ups using FBI rap sheets were\r\nconducted in 1976 and 1984. Variables obtained from the Bureau of\r\nPrisons forms include age upon entry, race, marital status, age at\r\nfirst arrest, number of prior adult convictions, commitment\r\noffense(s), highest school grade completed, drug dependency, and\r\nalcoholism. Scales developed from the PSIs provide data on father,\r\nmother, and siblings, family incohesiveness, adequacy of childhood\r\ndwelling, social deviance of family, school problems, employment\r\nproblems, achievement motivation, problems with interpersonal\r\nrelations, authority conflicts, childhood and adolescent or adult\r\nmaladjustment and deviance, poor physical health, juvenile conviction\r\nrecord, adult arrest and conviction record, violence of offense, group\r\ninfluence on illegal behavior, and prior prison adjustment. The intake\r\ninterview inquired about the developmental family history and the\r\nchild's development, the inmate's marriage, educational, and work\r\nhistory and attitudes, attitudes toward sex, military service and\r\nattitudes, self-reported use of alcohol and other substances,\r\nreligious preferences and practices, and problems during any previous\r\nconfinements. Scales based on the psychologists' Q-sorts evaluated\r\naggression, hostility avoidance, authority conflict, sociability,\r\nsocial withdrawal, social/emotional constriction, passivity,\r\ndominance, and adaptation to the environment.

Three experimental treatments were employed: (1)\r\n advising and possibly separating the couple, (2) issuing a citation\r\n (an order to appear in court to answer specific charges) to the\r\n offender, and (3) arresting the offender. The main focus of the\r\n project concerned whether arrest is the most effective law enforcement\r\n response for deterring recidivism of spouse abusers. Cases were\r\n randomly assigned to one of the three treatments and were followed for\r\n at least six months to determine whether recidivism occurred. Measures\r\n of recidivism were obtained through official police records and victim\r\n interviews. Cases that met the following eligibility guidelines were\r\n included in the project: (1) a call involving a misdemeanor offense\r\n committed by a male offender aged 18 or over against a female victim\r\n aged 18 or over who were spouses, (2) ex-spouses, (3) cohabitants, or\r\n (4) ex-cohabitants. Also, both suspect and victim had to be present\r\n when officers arrived at the scene. Victims were interviewed\r\n twice. The first interview occurred shortly after the \"presenting\r\n incident,\" the incident that initiated a call for police assistance.\r\n This initial interview focused on episodes of abuse that occurred\r\n between the time of the presenting incident and the day of the initial\r\n interview. In particular, detailed data were gathered on the nature of\r\n physical violence directed against the victim, the history of the\r\n victim's marital and cohabitating relationships, the nature of the\r\n presenting incident prior to the arrival of the police, the actual\r\n actions taken by the police at the scene, post-incident separations\r\n and reunions of the victim and the offender, recidivism since the\r\n presenting incident, the victim's previous abuse history, alcohol and\r\n drug use of both the victim and the offender, and the victim's\r\n help-seeking actions. Questions were asked regarding whether the\r\n offender had threatened to hurt the victim, actually hurt or tried to\r\n hurt the victim, threatened to hurt any member of the family, actually\r\n hurt or tried to hurt any member of the family, threatened to damage\r\n property, or actually damaged any property. In addition, criminal\r\n histories and arrest data for the six-month period subsequent to the\r\n presenting incident were collected for offenders. A follow-up\r\n interview was conducted approximately six months after the presenting\r\n incident and focused primarily on recidivism since the initial\r\n interview. Arrest recidivism was defined as any arrest for any\r\n subsequent offense by the same offender against the same victim\r\n committed within six months of the presenting incident. Victims were\r\n asked to estimate how often each type of victimization had occurred\r\n and to answer more detailed questions on the first and most recent\r\nincidents of victimization.",

The data address the following topics: (1) types of drugs used\r\nby arrestees (based on self-reports and urinalysis), (2) self-reported\r\ndependency on drugs, (3) self-reported need for alcohol/drug\r\ntreatment, (4) the relationship between drug use and certain types of\r\noffenses, and (5) the relationship between self-reported indicators of\r\ndrug use and indicators of drug use based on urinalysis. Participation\r\nin the project is voluntary, and all information collected from the\r\narrestees is anonymous and confidential. The data include the\r\narrestee's age, race, gender, educational attainment, marital status,\r\nand the charge at the time of booking. The recently modified DUF\r\ninterview instrument (used for part of the 1995 data and all of the\r\n1996 and 1997 data) also collected information about the arrestee's\r\nuse of 15 drugs, including recent and past use (e.g., 3-day and 30-day\r\ndrug use) of each of these drugs, age at first use, and whether the\r\narrestee had ever been dependent on drugs. In the original DUF\r\ninterview instrument (used for the 1987 to 1994 data and part of the\r\n1995 data), the information collected was the same as above except\r\nthat the use of 22 drugs was queried, and the age at which the\r\narrestee first became dependent on the drug was included. Arrestees\r\nalso were questioned in the original instrument about their history of\r\nintravenous drug use, whether the consideration of AIDS influenced\r\nwhether they shared needles, history of drug and alcohol treatment,\r\ntheir past and current drug treatment needs, and how many persons they\r\nhad sex with during the past 12 months. Finally, arrestees were asked\r\nto provide a urine specimen, which was screened for the presence of\r\nten drugs, including marijuana, opiates, cocaine, PCP, methadone,\r\nbenzodiazepines (Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (Darvon),\r\nbarbiturates, and amphetamines (positive test results for amphetamines\r\nwere confirmed by gas chromatography).

This data collection consists of four datasets from three\r\nsites.

The Chicago, Illinois, program began in October 1990 and ended\r\nin March 1992. These first three programs studied probationers with a\r\nhistory of recent drug use who were not incarcerated while awaiting\r\nsentencing. The subjects were assessed with one of two different\r\ntreatment instruments. Half of all clients were assessed with the\r\nobjective Offender Profile Index (OPI) created by the National\r\nAssociation of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD). The\r\nother half were assessed with the local instrument administered in\r\neach site by Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime (TASC),\r\nInc. Regardless of which assessment procedure was used, offenders were\r\nthen randomly assigned to one of two groups. Half of all offenders\r\nassessed by the OPI and half of the offenders assessed by the local\r\ninstrument were assigned to a control group that received only random\r\nurinalysis monitoring regardless of the drug treatment intervention\r\nstrategy prescribed by the assessment instrument. The other half of\r\noffenders in each assessment group were assigned to a treatment group\r\nthat received appropriate drug intervention treatment. The Phoenix\r\npilot study (Part 4), which ran from March 1991 to May 1992, was\r\ndesigned like the first Phoenix study, except that the sample for the\r\npilot study was drawn from convicted felons who were jailed prior to\r\nsentencing and who were expected to be sentenced to probation. These\r\ndata contain administrative information, such as current offense,\r\nnumber of arrests, number of convictions, and prior charges.
