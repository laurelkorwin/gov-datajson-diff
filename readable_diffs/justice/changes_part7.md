The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview.

This system is called the NEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP).\r\nThe NEISS-AIP is designed to provide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes of nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in U.S. hospital EDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national sample of U.S. NEISS hospitals, which were selected as a stratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The sample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and small hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per hospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond routine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related products in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and poisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and distribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States; (2) monitor unintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time; (3) identify emerging injury problems; (4) identify specific cases for follow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems; and (5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion effort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in a timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique and overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also, annually, the final edited data will be released as public use data files for use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).\r\nNEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines.\r\nNEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury\r\nSurveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC.\r\nIn 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. Beginning in 1992, the survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.\r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2019. A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year. Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information on the dataset, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 37645.",

-            "description": "Beginning in July 2000, the National Center for Injury\r\nPrevention and Control (NCIPC), and Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention (CDC), in collaboration with the United States Consumer\r\nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC), expanded the National Electronic\r\nInjury Surveillance System (NEISS) to collect data on all types and\r\ncauses of injuries treated in a representative sample of United States\r\nhospitals with emergency departments (ED). This system is called the\r\nNEISS-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP). The NEISS-AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

-            "description": "The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a\r\n part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), administered by the\r\n Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the late 1970s, the law\r\n enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\n UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\n program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\n fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\n contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\n comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n \"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\n developed. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\n state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\n for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\n System (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\n are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\n merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\n aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\n data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\n delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\n Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\n motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\n description, property value, and drug type and quantity), Part 7,\r\n Victim Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8,\r\n Offender Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment\r\n (arrest date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header\r\n Segment (Parts 1-3) separates and identifies individual police\r\n agencies by Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header\r\n information, which is contained on three records for each ORI,\r\n includes agency name, geographic location, and population of the\r\n area. Part 10, Group B Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data\r\n for Group B crimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to\r\n incidents for which the complete Group A Incident Report was not\r\n submitted to the FBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be\r\n generated if the incident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous\r\n year or if the incident occurred prior to when the agency started\r\n NIBRS reporting. As with the UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary\r\n on the part of law enforcement agencies. The data are not a\r\nrepresentative sample of crime in the United States.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\n enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\n UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\n program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\n fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\n contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\n comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n \"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\n developed. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\n state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\n for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\n System (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\n are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\n merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\n aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\n data on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\n delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\n Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\n motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\n description, property value, and drug type and quantity), Part 7,\r\n Victim Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8,\r\n Offender Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment\r\n (arrest date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header\r\n Segment (Parts 1-3) separates and identifies individual police\r\n agencies by Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header\r\n information, which is contained on three records for each ORI,\r\n includes agency name, geographic location, and population of the\r\n area. Part 10, Group B Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data\r\n for Group B crimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to\r\n incidents for which the complete Group A Incident Report was not\r\n submitted to the FBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be\r\n generated if the incident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous\r\n year or if the incident occurred prior to when the agency started\r\n NIBRS reporting. As with the UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary\r\n on the part of law enforcement agencies. The data are not a\r\nrepresentative sample of crime in the United States.",

The Act requires the attorney general to establish guidelines\r\nand collect, as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,\r\ndata \"about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race,\r\nreligion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including where\r\nappropriate the crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,\r\nforcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation,\r\narson, and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.\" Hate crime\r\ndata collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990\r\nand to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, the\r\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate Crime\r\nStatistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, as\r\nfactors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although the\r\nAct originally mandated data collection for five years, the Church\r\nArson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration \"for each\r\ncalendar year,\" making hate crime statistics a permanent addition to\r\nthe UCR program. As with the other UCR data, law enforcement agencies\r\ncontribute reports either directly or through their state reporting\r\nprograms. Information contained in the data includes number of victims\r\nand offenders involved in each hate crime incident, type of victims,\r\nbias motivation, offense type, and location type.",

The Act requires the attorney general to establish guidelines\r\nand collect, as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,\r\ndata \"about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race,\r\nreligion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including where\r\nappropriate the crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,\r\nforcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation,\r\narson, and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.\" Hate crime\r\ndata collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990\r\nand to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, the\r\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate Crime\r\nStatistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, as\r\nfactors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although the\r\nAct originally mandated data collection for five years, the Church\r\nArson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration \"for each\r\ncalendar year,\" making hate crime statistics a permanent addition to\r\nthe UCR program. As with the other UCR data, law enforcement agencies\r\ncontribute reports either directly or through their state reporting\r\nprograms. Information contained in the data includes number of victims\r\nand offenders involved in each hate crime incident, type of victims,\r\nbias motivation, offense type, and location type.",

The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297). It is the only national statistical collection that obtains detailed information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. The DCRP collects data on persons dying in state prisons, local jails and in the process of arrest. Each collection is a separate subcollection, but each is under the umbrella of the DCRP collection. The DCRP collects inmate death records from each of the nation's 50 state prison systems and approximately 2,800 local jail jurisdictions. In addition, this program collects records of all deaths occurring during the process of arrest. Data are collected directly from state and local law enforcement agencies.\r\nDeath records include information on decedent personal characteristics (age, race or Hispanic origin, and sex), decedent criminal background (legal status, offense type, and time served), and the death itself (date, time, location, and cause of death, as well as information on the autopsy and medical treatment provided for any illness or disease).\r\nThis data collection represents a single year of DCRP Jails data. The variable names and coding, while similar to other years, have not been standardized across years. The concatenated multi-year versions of the DCRP Jails population data have been edited to correct outliers and other data anomalies. Researchers are encouraged to use the concatenated multi-year data for final jail population data.",

An appeal can be filed by the government or the offender, and the appellant can appeal the sentence, the verdict, or both sentence and verdict. Appeals may be terminated on the merits or on procedural grounds. Of those that are terminated on the merits, the district court ruling may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to criminal court, or dismissed. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were either removed, coarsened, or blanked in order to protect the identities of individuals.

The data were collected to examine change and stability in the operations of crime laboratories serving federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first surveyed forensic crime laboratories in 1998, focusing solely on agencies that performed DNA analysis. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection, called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. For the 2014 study, data were collected from April 2015 to September 2015 on the organization, functions, budget, staffing, workload, and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2014. A total of 360 of the 409 eligible crime laboratories operating in 2014 responded to the census. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2014, including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The 2014 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets, personnel, accreditations, and backlogged cases.",

The data were collected to examine change and stability in the operations of crime laboratories serving federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first surveyed forensic crime laboratories in 1998, focusing solely on agencies that performed DNA analysis. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection, called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. For the 2014 study, data were collected from April 2015 to September 2015 on the organization, functions, budget, staffing, workload, and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2014. A total of 360 of the 409 eligible crime laboratories operating in 2014 responded to the census. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2014, including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The 2014 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets, personnel, accreditations, and backlogged cases.",

The 2015 Annual Survey of Jails is the 28th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-U.S. citizens in custody. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2015. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-U.S. citizens within the jail population.

Crimes included are criminal homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\nMuch information about these crimes is provided in this dataset. The number of times an offense has been reported, the number of reported offenses that have been cleared by arrests, and the number of cleared offenses which involved offenders under the age of 18 are the major items of information collected.",

The United States \r\nSentencing Commission's primary function is to inform federal courts of \r\nsentencing policies and practices that include guidelines prescribing the \r\nappropriate form and severity of punishment for offenders convicted of federal \r\ncrimes. Court-related variables include primary offense type, pecuniary \r\noffense loss and gain, dates of disposition and sentencing, method of \r\ndetermination of guilt, number of counts pled and charged, and dates and types\r\nof sentencing and restitution. Defendant organization variables include \r\nownership structure, number of owners and employees, highest level of \r\ncorporate knowledge of the criminal offense, highest level of corporate \r\nindictment and conviction for participation in the criminal offense, annual \r\nrevenue, equity and financial status of the defendant organization, whether \r\nit was a criminal organization, duration of criminal activity, and risk to \r\nnational security. Part 1, Organizational Defendants Data, 1988, describes \r\noffense and sentencing characteristics for organizations sentenced in federal \r\ndistrict courts in 1988.\r\nPart 2, Organizational Defendants Data, 1989-1990, is a compilation of \r\noffense and sentencing characteristics for the population of organizations \r\nsentenced in federal district courts during the period January 1, 1989, to \r\nJune 30, 1990. Part 3, Statute Data, 1989-1990, is a secondary component of \r\nthe Commission's study that includes only the statutes of conviction and \r\nnumber of counts per conviction, during the period January 1, 1989, to June \r\n30, 1990. Part 4, Organizational Defendants Data, 1987-1993, includes all \r\norganizational defendants sentenced pursuant to the Chapter Two, Part R (1987)\r\nantitrust guidelines and the Chapter Eight (1991) sentencing guidelines for \r\norganizational defendants that were sentenced between November 1, 1987, \r\nthrough September 30, 1993, and were received by the Commission. Part 6, \r\nOrganizational Defendants Data, 1994, gives information on organizational \r\ndefendants sentenced during fiscal year October 1, 1993, through September 30,\r\n1994, and includes culpability scores and Chapter Eight (1991) culpability \r\nscoring procedures. Part 8, Organizational Defendants Data, 1995, covers \r\nfiscal year October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995, and also includes \r\nculpability scores and Chapter Eight (1991) culpability scoring procedures. \r\nThis file includes 9 defendants sentenced pursuant to Section 2R1.1 (1987) \r\nand 111 defendants sentenced pursuant to the Chapter Eight guidelines.\r\nYears Produced: Updated annually\r\n",

The United States \r\nSentencing Commission's primary function is to inform federal courts of \r\nsentencing policies and practices that include guidelines prescribing the \r\nappropriate form and severity of punishment for offenders convicted of federal \r\ncrimes. Court-related variables include primary offense type, pecuniary \r\noffense loss and gain, dates of disposition and sentencing, method of \r\ndetermination of guilt, number of counts pled and charged, and dates and types\r\nof sentencing and restitution. Defendant organization variables include \r\nownership structure, number of owners and employees, highest level of \r\ncorporate knowledge of the criminal offense, highest level of corporate \r\nindictment and conviction for participation in the criminal offense, annual \r\nrevenue, equity and financial status of the defendant organization, whether \r\nit was a criminal organization, duration of criminal activity, and risk to \r\nnational security. Part 1, Organizational Defendants Data, 1988, describes \r\noffense and sentencing characteristics for organizations sentenced in federal \r\ndistrict courts in 1988.\r\nPart 2, Organizational Defendants Data, 1989-1990, is a compilation of \r\noffense and sentencing characteristics for the population of organizations \r\nsentenced in federal district courts during the period January 1, 1989, to \r\nJune 30, 1990. Part 3, Statute Data, 1989-1990, is a secondary component of \r\nthe Commission's study that includes only the statutes of conviction and \r\nnumber of counts per conviction, during the period January 1, 1989, to June \r\n30, 1990. Part 4, Organizational Defendants Data, 1987-1993, includes all \r\norganizational defendants sentenced pursuant to the Chapter Two, Part R (1987)\r\nantitrust guidelines and the Chapter Eight (1991) sentencing guidelines for \r\norganizational defendants that were sentenced between November 1, 1987, \r\nthrough September 30, 1993, and were received by the Commission. Part 6, \r\nOrganizational Defendants Data, 1994, gives information on organizational \r\ndefendants sentenced during fiscal year October 1, 1993, through September 30,\r\n1994, and includes culpability scores and Chapter Eight (1991) culpability \r\nscoring procedures. Part 8, Organizational Defendants Data, 1995, covers \r\nfiscal year October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995, and also includes \r\nculpability scores and Chapter Eight (1991) culpability scoring procedures. \r\nThis file includes 9 defendants sentenced pursuant to Section 2R1.1 (1987) \r\nand 111 defendants sentenced pursuant to the Chapter Eight guidelines.\r\nYears Produced: Updated annually\r\n",

Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nThe National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) series is a component part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), a nationwide view of crime administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), based on the submission of crime information by participating law enforcement agencies. The NIBRS was implemented to meet the new guidelines formulated for the UCR to provide new ways of looking at crime for the 21st century. NIBRS is an expanded and enhanced UCR Program, designed to capture incident-level data and data focused on various aspects of a crime incident. The NIBRS was aimed at offering law enforcement and the academic community more comprehensive data than ever before available for management, training, planning, research, and other uses. NIBRS collects data on each single incident and arrest within 22 offense categories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. In addition, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported. NIBRS data on different aspects of crime incidents such as offenses, victims, offenders, arrestees, etc., can be examined as different units of analysis. The data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be merged by using linkage variables.\r\nNACJD has prepared a resource guide on NIBRS.",

Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nThe National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) series is a component part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), a nationwide view of crime administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), based on the submission of crime information by participating law enforcement agencies. The NIBRS was implemented to meet the new guidelines formulated for the UCR to provide new ways of looking at crime for the 21st century. NIBRS is an expanded and enhanced UCR Program, designed to capture incident-level data and data focused on various aspects of a crime incident. The NIBRS was aimed at offering law enforcement and the academic community more comprehensive data than ever before available for management, training, planning, research, and other uses. NIBRS collects data on each single incident and arrest within 22 offense categories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. In addition, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported. NIBRS data on different aspects of crime incidents such as offenses, victims, offenders, arrestees, etc., can be examined as different units of analysis. The data are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be merged by using linkage variables.\r\nNACJD has prepared a resource guide on NIBRS.",

It is produced every\r\nthree or four years since it was first conducted.

Constitutionality compares each\r\ncase's sentencing date, circuit, district, and judge to provide\r\nuniformity in reporting the cases. In 1999, the United States\r\nSentencing Commission added more variables from its databases to this\r\ncollection, so the data are now provided in two files. Part 1, Main\r\nData, includes the most important variables for each case, such as\r\ndefendant's age, criminal history points, armed criminal status, case\r\ndisposition, sentence, and fines applied. Part 2, Supplemental Data,\r\ncontains additional variables involving multiple guideline computation\r\nand count-based statutes. For a more detailed discussion of the two\r\nfiles, users should consult the codebook.",

Seven main classifications of crime were\r\n chosen to gauge fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of\r\n crime. These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\n Crime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\n manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\n property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\n By congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\n in 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\n attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\n public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\n another, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\n of arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\n arrest or other means. The counts include all reports of arson\r\n received from victims, officers who discovered infractions, or other\r\nsources.",

Seven main classifications of crime were\r\n chosen to gauge fluctuations in the overall volume and rate of\r\n crime. These seven classifications that eventually became known as the\r\n Crime Index included the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent\r\n manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the\r\n property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.\r\n By congressional mandate, arson was added as the eighth Index offense\r\n in 1979. Arson is defined as any willful or malicious burning or\r\n attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house,\r\n public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of\r\n another, etc. The arson data files include monthly data on the number\r\n of arson offenses reported and the number of offenses cleared by\r\n arrest or other means. The counts include all reports of arson\r\n received from victims, officers who discovered infractions, or other\r\nsources.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\n enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\n UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\n program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\n fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\n contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\n comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n \"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\n developed. Using the \"Blueprint,\" and in consultation with local and\r\n state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\n for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\n System (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data\r\n are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be\r\n merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\n aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\n data on the incident, itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\n delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\n Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\n motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\n description, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\n Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\n Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\n date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n 1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\n Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\n is contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\n geographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\n Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.\r\n Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the\r\n complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In\r\n general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident\r\n occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident\r\n occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the\r\n UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\n enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States.",

This system is called the\r\nNEISS All Injury Program (NEISS AIP). The NEISS AIP is designed to\r\nprovide national incidence estimates of all types and external causes\r\nof nonfatal injuries and poisonings treated in United States hospital\r\nEDs. Data on injury-related visits are being obtained from a national\r\nsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals that were selected as a\r\nstratified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and\r\nits territories with a minimum of six beds and a 24-hour ED. The\r\nsample includes separate strata for very large, large, medium, and\r\nsmall hospitals, defined by the number of annual ED visits per\r\nhospital, and children's hospitals. The scope of reporting goes beyond\r\nroutine reporting of injuries associated with consumer-related\r\nproducts in CPSC's jurisdiction to include all injuries and\r\npoisonings. The data can be used to (1) measure the magnitude and\r\ndistribution of nonfatal injuries in the United States, (2) monitor\r\nunintentional and violence-related nonfatal injuries over time, (3)\r\nidentify emerging injury problems, (4) identify specific cases for\r\nfollow-up investigations of particular injury-related problems, and\r\n(5) set national priorities. A fundamental principle of this expansion\r\neffort is that preliminary surveillance data will be made available in\r\na timely manner to a number of different federal agencies with unique\r\nand overlapping public health responsibilities and concerns. Also,\r\nannually, the final edited data are released as public use data files\r\nfor use by other public health professionals and researchers. NEISS-AIP data on nonfatal injuries were collected from January through December each year except the year 2000 when data were collected from July through December (ICPSR 3582).NEISS AIP is providing data on approximately over 500,000 cases annually. Data obtained on each case include age, race/ethnicity, gender, principal diagnosis, primary body part affected, consumer products involved, disposition at ED discharge (i.e., hospitalized, transferred, treated and released, observation, died), locale where the injury occurred, work-relatedness, and a narrative description of the injury circumstances. Also, major categories of external cause of injury (e.g., motor vehicle, falls, cut/pierce, poisoning, fire/burn) and of intent of injury (e.g., unintentional, assault, intentional self-harm, legal intervention) are being coded for each case in a manner consistent with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding rules and guidelines. NEISS has been managed and operated by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1972 and is used by the Commission for identifying and monitoring consumer product-related injuries and for assessing risk to all United States residents. These product-related injury data are used for educating consumers about hazardous products and for identifying injury-related cases used in detailed studies of specific products and associated hazard patterns. These studies set the stage for developing both voluntary and mandatory safety standards.\r\nSince the early 1980s, CPSC has assisted other federal agencies by using NEISS to collect injury- related data of special interest to them. In 1990, an interagency agreement was established between NCIPC and CPSC to (1) collect NEISS data on nonfatal firearm-related injuries for the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study; (2) publish NEISS data on a variety of injury-related topics, such as in-line skating, firearms, BB and pellet guns, bicycles, boat propellers, personal water craft, and playground injuries; and (3) to address common concerns. CPSC also uses NEISS to collect data on work-related injuries for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC. In 1997, the interagency agreement was modified to conduct the three-month NEISS All Injury Pilot Study at 21 NEISS hospitals (see Quinlan KP, Thompson MP, Annest JL, et al. Expanding the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System to Monitor All Nonfatal Injuries Treated in US Hospital Emergency Departments. Annals Emerg. Med. 1999;34:637-643.) This study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding NEISS to collect data on all injuries. National estimates based on this study indicated product-related injuries that fall into CPSC's jurisdiction accounted for approximately 50 percent of injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The study also indicated that NEISS is a cost-effective system for capturing data on all injuries treated in U.S. hospital EDs. The NEISS-AIP provides an excellent data source for monitoring national estimates of nonfatal injuries over time. Analysis and dissemination of these surveillance data through the ICPSR, and Internet publications will help support NCIPC's mission of reducing all types and causes of injuries in the United States, as well as assist other federal agencies with responsibilities for injury prevention and control.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\ndata are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident.

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\ndata are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B\r\ncrimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for\r\nwhich the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the\r\nFBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the\r\nincident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the\r\nincident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As\r\nwith UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States. For 1994, ten states, fully or partially\r\nparticipating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.",

Constitutionality compares each case's sentencing date, circuit, district, and judge to provide uniformity in reporting the cases. In 1999, the United States Sentencing Commission added more variables from its databases to this collection, so the data are now provided in two files. Several variables iterate to include multiple occurrences of the same event. Part 1, Main Data, includes all noniterating variables plus the highest occurrences of each iterating variable. Part 2, Supplementary Data, includes the remaining iterations.",

Constitutionality compares each case's sentencing date, circuit, district, and judge to provide uniformity in reporting the cases. In 1999, the United States Sentencing Commission added more variables from its databases to this collection, so the data are now provided in two files.

Furthermore, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what school programs, practices, and policies are used by\r\nschools in their efforts to prevent crime. SSOCS has been conducted three times, in school years 1999-2000, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006.\r\nThe 2003-2004 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2004) was developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and conducted by Abt Associates Inc. Questionnaire packets were mailed to 3,743 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools. A total of 2,772 public schools submitted usable questionnaires for a weighted response rate of 77.2 percent. Data were collected from March 1, 2004, to June 4, 2004.",

A total of 2,772 public schools submitted usable questionnaires for a weighted response rate of 77.2 percent. Data were collected from March 1, 2004, to June 4, 2004.",

The Act requires a 10 percent sample of juvenile facilities to be listed by incidence of sexual assault. Data are collected directly from youth in a private setting using audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) technology with a touch-screen laptop and an audio feed to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first year of collection includes nearly 200 juvenile facilities, with an estimated 10,000 completed interviews with youth.\r\nThe National Survey of Youth in Custody Alternate (NSYC-A) is a supplement to NSYC that collected information on drug and alcohol use by youth in juvenile facilities. The survey was divided into six sections. Section A collected background information, such as age, gender, education level, and whether respondent had stayed overnight in a facility or had forced sexual contact prior to current incarceration. Section B, Facility Perceptions and Victimization, is not included in this dataset. Section C, Drug Use, included whether the respondent had ever used specific types of drugs, frequency of use in the past and immediately before being taken into custody, source of drugs, and symptoms of drug abuse and dependence. Section D, Alcohol Use, captured alcohol dependence and abuse symptoms. Section E, Treatment, focused on drug or alcohol treatment programs respondent had attended prior to being taken into custody. Section F, Family and Peer Background is not included in this dataset.\r\nOther items include weights variables and derived variables regarding DSM IV drug dependence symptoms, alcohol and drug use/dependence/abuse status, outliers/illogical responses, and categorized demographic variables.",

The Act requires a 10 percent sample of juvenile facilities to be listed by incidence of sexual assault. Data are collected directly from youth in a private setting using audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) technology with a touch-screen laptop and an audio feed to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first year of collection includes nearly 200 juvenile facilities, with an estimated 10,000 completed interviews with youth.\r\nThe National Survey of Youth in Custody Alternate (NSYC-A) is a supplement to NSYC that collected information on drug and alcohol use by youth in juvenile facilities. The survey was divided into six sections. Section A collected background information, such as age, gender, education level, and whether respondent had stayed overnight in a facility or had forced sexual contact prior to current incarceration. Section B, Facility Perceptions and Victimization, is not included in this dataset. Section C, Drug Use, included whether the respondent had ever used specific types of drugs, frequency of use in the past and immediately before being taken into custody, source of drugs, and symptoms of drug abuse and dependence. Section D, Alcohol Use, captured alcohol dependence and abuse symptoms. Section E, Treatment, focused on drug or alcohol treatment programs respondent had attended prior to being taken into custody. Section F, Family and Peer Background is not included in this dataset.\r\nOther items include weights variables and derived variables regarding DSM IV drug dependence symptoms, alcohol and drug use/dependence/abuse status, outliers/illogical responses, and categorized demographic variables.",

In the late 1970s, the law\r\nenforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the\r\nUCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR\r\nprogram to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI\r\nfully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet\r\ncontemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a\r\ncomprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a\r\n\"Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program\" was\r\ndeveloped. Using the \"Blueprint\" and in consultation with local and\r\nstate law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines\r\nfor the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting\r\nSystem (NIBRS) is being implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS\r\ndata are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files, which may be\r\nmerged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of\r\naspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers\r\ndata on the incident itself (date and time). Each crime incident is\r\ndelineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are\r\nPart 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias\r\nmotivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property\r\ndescription, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim\r\nSegment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender\r\nSegment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest\r\ndate, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts\r\n1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by\r\nOriginating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which\r\nis contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,\r\ngeographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B\r\nArrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B\r\ncrimes. Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for\r\nwhich the complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the\r\nFBI. In general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the\r\nincident occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the\r\nincident occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As\r\nwith UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law\r\nenforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of\r\ncrime in the United States. For 1999, 18 states, fully or partially\r\nparticipating in NIBRS, were included in the dataset.",

The data include commitments of United States District Court, violators of conditions of release (e.g., parole, probation, or supervised release violators), offenders convicted in other courts (e.g., military or District of Columbia courts), and persons admitted to prison as material witnesses or for purposes of treatment, examination, or transfer to another authority. Records of offenders who exit federal prison temporarily, such as for transit to another location, to serve a weekend sentence, or for health care, are not included in the exiting cohort. These data include variables that describe the offender, such as age, race, citizenship, as well as variables that describe the sentences and expected prison terms. The data file contains original variables from the Bureau of Prisons' SENTRY database, as well as \"SAF\" variables that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 7.9-7.16. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.",

The Act requires the attorney general to establish guidelines\r\nand collect, as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,\r\ndata \"about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race,\r\nreligion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including where\r\nappropriate the crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,\r\nforcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation,\r\narson, and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.\" Hate crime\r\ndata collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990\r\nand to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, the\r\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate Crime\r\nStatistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, as\r\nfactors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although the\r\nAct originally mandated data collection for five years, the Church\r\nArson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration \"for each\r\ncalendar year,\" making hate crime statistics a permanent addition to\r\nthe UCR program. As with the other UCR data, law enforcement agencies\r\ncontribute reports either directly or through their state reporting\r\nprograms. Information contained in the data includes number of victims\r\nand offenders involved in each hate crime incident, type of victims,\r\nbias motivation, offense type, and location type.",

The Act requires the attorney general to establish guidelines\r\nand collect, as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,\r\ndata \"about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race,\r\nreligion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, including where\r\nappropriate the crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,\r\nforcible rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation,\r\narson, and destruction, damage or vandalism of property.\" Hate crime\r\ndata collection was required by the Act to begin in calendar year 1990\r\nand to continue for four successive years. In September 1994, the\r\nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act amended the Hate Crime\r\nStatistics Act to add disabilities, both physical and mental, as\r\nfactors that could be considered a basis for hate crimes. Although the\r\nAct originally mandated data collection for five years, the Church\r\nArson Prevention Act of 1996 amended the collection duration \"for each\r\ncalendar year,\" making hate crime statistics a permanent addition to\r\nthe UCR program. As with the other UCR data, law enforcement agencies\r\ncontribute reports either directly or through their state reporting\r\nprograms. Information contained in the data includes number of victims\r\nand offenders involved in each hate crime incident, type of victims,\r\nbias motivation, offense type, and location type.",

-            "description": "The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. \r\nThis dataset represents the concatenated version of the NCVS on a collection year basis for 1992-2012.  A collection year contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.  Under the collection year format, victimizations are counted in the year the interview is conducted, regardless of the year when the crime incident occurred.\r\nFor additional information, please see the documentation for the data from the most current year of the NCVS, ICPSR Study 34650.",

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft).

Since 1979, the Census Bureau has been the NPS data collection agent.\r\nThe NPS is administered to 51 respondents. Before 2001, the District of Columbia was also a respondent, but responsibility for housing the District of Columbia's sentenced prisoners was transferred to the federal Bureau of Prisons, and by yearend 2001 the District of Columbia no longer operated a prison system.\r\nThe NPS provides an enumeration of persons in state and federal prisons and collects data on key characteristics of the nation's prison population.  NPS has been adapted over time to keep pace with the changing information needs of the public, researchers, and federal, state, and local governments.",

Since 1979, the Census Bureau has been the NPS data collection agent.\r\nThe NPS is administered to 51 respondents. Before 2001, the District of Columbia was also a respondent, but responsibility for housing the District of Columbia's sentenced prisoners was transferred to the federal Bureau of Prisons, and by yearend 2001 the District of Columbia no longer operated a prison system.\r\nThe NPS provides an enumeration of persons in state and federal prisons and collects data on key characteristics of the nation's prison population.  NPS has been adapted over time to keep pace with the changing information needs of the public, researchers, and federal, state, and local governments.",

The data were collected by RTI International under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NIS-3 comprised two questionnaires -- a survey of sexual victimization and a survey of mental and physical health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for substance abuse. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive one of the questionnaires so that at the time of the interview the content of the survey remained unknown to facility staff and the interviewers. A total of 81,566 inmates participated in the survey, including 32,029 inmates in state and federal prisons, 48,066 inmates in jails, 399 inmates in military facilities, 115 inmates in Indian country jails, and 957 inmates in facilities operated by ICE.\r\n The NIS-3 was specially designed to provide estimates of sexual victimization for inmates ages 16 to 17 held in adult facilities. Previous NIS collections excluded inmates age 17 or younger due to special human subject issues (related to consent and assent, as well as risk of trauma in the survey process) and statistical issues (related to clustering of youth and the need to oversample to ensure a representative sample). To address issues of consent and risk, the NIS-3 juvenile sample was restricted to inmates ages 16 to 17 (who represented an estimated 95 percent of the 1,790 juveniles held in prisons at year end 2011 and 97 percent of the 5,870 juveniles held in local jails at midyear 2011). \r\nThe respondents were asked about the type of sexual contact, the frequency, when it occurred, and where it occurred. The survey also sought information on any injuries received and the treatment obtained for those injuries. Other questions pertained to the reporting of sexual contact -- if it was reported, to whom it was reported, and any results from reporting sexual contact. Respondents were also asked for reasons why they had not reported the sexual contact if no report was made. Background and demographic information collected includes reasons for incarceration, sexual history, sexual orientation, marital status, gender, ethnicity, and physical characteristics such as height and weight. The NIS-3 collected data on the mental health problems of inmates for the first time in 2011-12. Inmates were asked whether they had been told by a mental health professional that they had a mental disorder or if because of a mental health problem they had stayed overnight in a hospital or other facility, used prescription medicine, or they had received counseling or treatment from a trained professional.",

It is estimated that over 90 percent of felony defendants in the federal criminal justice system are sentenced pursuant to the SRA of 1984. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.
