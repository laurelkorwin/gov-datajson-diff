+            "description": "The Urban Institute established the Reentry Mapping Network (RMN), a group of jurisdictions applying a data-driven, spatial approach to prisoner reentry. The purpose of the study was to examine three National Institute of Justice-funded RMN sites: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Washington, DC, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  As members of the Reentry Mapping Network, the three sites collected local data related to incarceration, reentry, and community well-being. The Nonprofit Center of Milwaukee's Neighborhood Data Center was the lead Reentry Mapping Network partner in Milwaukee.  Data on a total of 168 census tracts in Milwaukee (Part 1) during the calendar year 2003 were obtained from the Wisconsin Department of Corrections.  NeighborhoodInfo DC was the lead reentry mapping network partner in Washington, DC.  Data on a total of 7,286 ex-offenders in Washington, DC (Part 2) during the calendar year 2004 were obtained from the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia.  The Winston-Salem Reentry Mapping Network project was managed by the Center for Community Safety (CCS), a public service and research center of Winston-Salem State University. Data on a total of 2,896 ex-offenders in Forsyth County (Part 3) during the calendar year 2003 were obtained from the North Carolina Department of Corrections (DOC), the Forsyth County Sheriff's Department (Forsyth County Detention Center [FCDC]), and the North Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (DJJDP).  The Milwaukee, Wisconsin Data (Part 1) contain a total of 95 variables including race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, education, job status, dependents, general risk assessment, alcohol risk, drug risk, need for alcohol treatment, and need for drug treatment. Also included are four geographic variables. The Washington, DC Data (Part 2) contain a total of 13 variables including supervision type, whether supervision began in calendar year 2004, date supervision period began, date supervision period ended, sex, marital status, ethnicity, age, education, unemployment status, state, and Census tract. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina Data (Part 3) contain a total of 14 variables including race, sex, primary offense, admittance date, date pardoned, street, city, state, status, jurisdiction, and age at admission.",

The project involved a prospective, randomized experimental study in which 466 NCO cases were randomly assigned to either the current level of NCO enforcement (the control condition, N=229) or to proactive enforcement (the treatment condition, N=237). An additional 51 interim control cases were enrolled in the study during a coverage gap between the two officers that implemented the treatment condition over the course of the study. The treatment condition involved the following intervention: (1) a special domestic violence investigator assigned by the jurisdiction's sheriff proactively \"checked in\" with the \"treatment\" group of victims to verify that they understood the NCO and to monitor compliance; (2) the investigator provided advice on mobilizing law enforcement and collecting evidence to help sanction the offender if the order was violated. Data were collected from official Lexington County Sheriff's Department (LCSD), Criminal Domestic Violence Court (CDVC), and Office of Diversion Programs (ODP) records (Dataset 1, Offender Data). Efforts were made to interview victims at six weeks (Dataset 2, Time 1 Victim Interview Data, N=141) and six months (Dataset 3, Time 2 Victim Interview Data, N=100) after the gateway arrest. Dataset 4 (Combined Time 1/Time 2 Victim Interview Data, N=97) include overall measures for respondents who completed both the Time 1 and Time 2 interviews. The victim interviews include measures on background characteristics, life experiences, circumstances surrounding the \"gateway incident\" which resulted in the case being enrolled in the study, and subsequent victimization experiences and no-contact order compliance levels.",

The Pennsylvania Statewide Survey (Part 1, Pennsylvania Statewide Survey Quantitative Data) was sent to all counties operating their own jails in September 2004. Surveys were mailed to 63 of the state's 67 counties. Counties were selected for intensive site visits (Part 2, Intensive Site Visit Qualitative Data) based largely on the results of the Phase I survey and focused on counties with the most extreme crowding problems and/or expressing interest in tackling population control issues. Visits were made to 14 of the state's 67 counties between September 2004 and May 2005. Part 1 includes variables on jail capacity and population, construction, population control measures, potential change targets, and transportation issues.

-            "description": "The purpose of the study was to expand understanding of the long-term consequences of juvenile delinquency by describing the prevalence and frequency of two adult outcomes -- arrest and the perpetration of abuse and neglect -- within a gender-diverse sample of known offenders. The researchers also sought to better inform the development and provision of services targeted to delinquent youth in residential care by exploring whether characteristics assessed at intake into care predict adult offending risk. The research team tracked a large sample of delinquent boys and girls released from juvenile correctional facilities/programs in New York State in the early 1990s and used state administrative databases to document their involvement with criminal justice and child protective services in young adulthood. Sample youth were initially drawn from a research database originally created to examine short-term criminal recidivism rates and associated risk factors among known juvenile delinquents (Frederick, 1999). As part of that study, a comprehensive list of adjudicated delinquents discharged from the custody of the New York State (NYS) Division of Youth between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1994, was generated. The research team selected a stratified, random subsample of 999 youths with case reviews and tracked them forward through time from age 16 to age 28. The Administrative/Case File Review Data (Part 1) contain information on the experiences prior to being admitted into state custody of 999 youths. Specifically, Part 1 includes early risk factors taken from items coded during the initial recidivism study conducted by Frederick (1999). Part 1 also includes information on a youth's childhood experiences with child welfare services collected by the research team as part of this study. Information on a youth's prior receipt of child welfare services was obtained by extracting records from the NYS Child Care Review Service system (CCRS). The Child Protective Services Reports Data (Part 2) contain information on the sampled subjects' involvement with Child Protective Services (CPS) as young adults (ages 16-28). CPS data were collected by conducting person-based searches of CONNECTIONS, the NYS Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System. For Part 2, adult perpetration of child maltreatment outcome data were collected on a total of 1,543 child protective services (CPS) reports. The Criminal History Data (Part 3) contain information on the sampled subjects' early adult involvement (ages 16-28) with the NYS adult criminal justice system. The research team documented adult crime and perpetration of child abuse and neglect via searches of two independent state administrative databases: (1) the NYS Offender-Based Transaction Statistics Computerized Criminal History (OBTS/CCH) database, which records all New York state-based arrests of individuals age 16 or older from point of arrest through disposition and sentencing; (2) the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) database, which tracks all New York State prison admissions and discharges. For Part 3, data were collected on a total of 6,627 adult arrest events. Part 1 contains 30 variables detailing information on the study participants, including demographic variables and variables related to offense history, individual functioning, child maltreatment, receipt of child welfare services, and family environment. Part 2 includes 22 variables derived from child protective services (CPS) reports linked to a study participant, including variables relating to the participant's perpetration of child maltreatment, type of alleged maltreatment, investigation outcome, and outcome variables reflecting participants' involvement in various types of maltreatment allegations. Finally, Part 3 of the study contains 147 variables derived from specific adult arrest events associated with the participants, including arrest-specific variables, case outcome variables, and criminal history variables.",

Using a wide variety of secondary sources, the principal investigator collected data beyond what was available in the AMERICAN TERRORISM STUDY, 1980-2002 (ICPSR 4639) and constructed an alternate database, the Right-Wing Terrorist Recruitment (RWTR) database, that related to terrorist recruitment and individual-level risk factors.  The research team collected data on a total of 112 persons from 16 right-wing extremist (RWE) groups.  In order to analyze the recruitment process, the principal investigator developed a new codebook that included a greater number of variables designed to measure different dimensions of the recruitment process. Some of the variables the investigator included were already in the American Terrorism Study dataset, however, the variable categories were revised. Other variables were included in light of prior terrorism studies and related scholarship such as research in the areas of social movements and new religious movements. The investigator also designed variables to measure the structural characteristics of the recruitment process.  The dataset includes a total of 82 terrorist recruitment and individual-level risk factor variables.",

Using a wide variety of secondary sources, the principal investigator collected data beyond what was available in the AMERICAN TERRORISM STUDY, 1980-2002 (ICPSR 4639) and constructed an alternate database, the Right-Wing Terrorist Recruitment (RWTR) database, that related to terrorist recruitment and individual-level risk factors.  The research team collected data on a total of 112 persons from 16 right-wing extremist (RWE) groups.  In order to analyze the recruitment process, the principal investigator developed a new codebook that included a greater number of variables designed to measure different dimensions of the recruitment process. Some of the variables the investigator included were already in the American Terrorism Study dataset, however, the variable categories were revised. Other variables were included in light of prior terrorism studies and related scholarship such as research in the areas of social movements and new religious movements. The investigator also designed variables to measure the structural characteristics of the recruitment process.  The dataset includes a total of 82 terrorist recruitment and individual-level risk factor variables.",

This study developed and tested a grounded comprehensive theoretical model of the relationship between alcohol availability and violence and disorder. The study also developed a geographic information system (GIS) containing neighborhood crime and demographic and physical environmental characteristics at the block group level for 431 block groups in the District of Columbia. The principal investigator calculated density measures of alcohol availability and distribution practices and aggregated characteristics of neighborhoods to examine the relationships of those measures to crime and violence. The project used data from various sources to create multiple variables measuring the physical, social, economic, and cultural characteristics of a given area in addition to the density of alcohol-selling establishments by type and incidence of criminal activity.  This study examined the influence of alcohol outlets on four outcomes: (1) aggravated assault incidents, (2) calls for service for disorderly conduct, (3) calls for services for social disorder more broadly defined, and (4) calls for service for a domestic incident.  The dataset for this study contains a total of 103 variables including crime variables, Census variables, alcohol outlet variables, neighborhood structural constraints variables, motivated offenders variables, and physical environment variables.",

The research team conducted a national survey (Part 1) of a stratified random sample of United States law enforcement agencies regarding the deployment of, policies for, and training with less lethal technologies. Finalized surveys were mailed in July 2006 to 950 law enforcement agencies, and a total of 518 law enforcement agencies provided information on less lethal force generally and on their deployment and policies regarding conducted energy devices (CEDs) in particular. A total of 292 variables are included in the National Use of Force Survey Data (Part 1) including items about weapons deployment, force policies, training, force reporting/review, force incidents and outcomes, and conducted energy devices (CEDs). Researchers also collected agency-supplied use of force data from law enforcement agencies in Richland County, South Carolina; Miami-Dade, Florida; and Seattle, Washington; to identify individual and situational predictors of injuries to officers and citizens during use of force events. The Richland County, South Carolina Data (Part 2) include 441 use-of-force reports from January 2005 through July 2006. Part 2 contains 17 variables including whether the officer or suspect was injured, 8 measures of officer force, 3 measures of suspect resistance, the number of witnesses and officers present at each incident, and the number of suspects that resisted or assaulted officers for each incident. The Miami-Dade County, Florida Data (Part 3) consist of 762 use-of-force incidents that occurred between January 2002 and May 2006. Part 3 contains 15 variables, including 4 measures of officer force, the most serious resistance on the part of the suspect, whether the officer or suspect was injured, whether the suspect was impaired by drugs or alcohol, the officer's length of service in years, and several demographic variables pertaining to the suspect and officer. The Seattle, Washington Data (Part 4) consist of 676 use-of-force incidents that occurred between December 1, 2005, as 15 variables, including 3 measures of officer force, whether the suspect or officer was injured, whether the suspect was impaired by drugs or alcohol, whether the suspect used, or threatened to use, physical force against the officer(s), and several demographic variables relating to the suspect and officer(s). The researchers obtained use of force survey data from several large departments representing different types of law enforcement agencies (municipal, county, sheriff's department) in different states. The research team combined use of force data from multiple agencies into a single dataset. This Multiagency Use of Force Data (Part 5) includes 24,928 use-of-force incidents obtained from 12 law enforcement agencies from 1998 through 2007. Part 5 consists a total of 21 variables, including the year the incident took place, demographic variables relating to the suspect, the type of force used by the officer, whether the suspect or officer was injured, and 5 measures of the department's policy regarding the use of CEDs and pepper spray. Lastly, longitudinal data were also collected for the Orlando, Florida and Austin, Texas police departments. The Orlando, Florida Longitudinal Data (Part 6) comprise 4,222 use-of-force incidents aggregated to 108 months -- a 9 year period from 1998 through 2006. Finally, the Austin, Texas Longitudinal Data (Part 7) include 6,596 force incidents aggregated over 60 months- a 5 year period from 2002 through 2006. Part 6 and Part 7 are comprised of seven variables documenting whether a Taser was implemented, the number of suspects and officers injured in a month, the number of force incidents per month, and the number of CEDs uses per month.",

In 2004 the JJF received a second OJJDP award to continue its work with community members, including over 18 government and nonprofit agencies from the social service, educational, law enforcement, court, prosecution, child advocacy arenas. The demonstration project in Atlanta-Fulton County focused on the collaborative activities of various government agencies, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and individuals from two counties (Fulton and DeKalb) who met on a regular basis to coordinate their efforts and to exchange information on sexual exploitation of children. The goals of the multiyear project were to: (1) enhance community awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of girls; (2) improve information and data sharing across agencies; (3) train professionals; and (4) improve delivery of care to child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. This study, funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), was designed to document the nature and extent of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) of children in Atlanta-Fulton County as well as the surrounding counties, and to conduct a process evaluation of the demonstration project. Data used in the study include quantitative results from a survey of professionals in Fulton, DeKalb, and Gwinnett Counties and quantitative data obtained from the Child Abuse Case Tracking Information System (CACTIS), a database that was designed to promote data and information sharing among agencies involved in the demonstration project. Primary source qualitative data were also obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with professionals involved in the project demonstration project, clients of the project (including both youths and their guardians), and homeless youths in Atlanta-Fulton County.",

Primary source qualitative data were also obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with professionals involved in the project demonstration project, clients of the project (including both youths and their guardians), and homeless youths in Atlanta-Fulton County.",

These interviews suggested several factors worthy of further testing. For instance, offenders believed they were less likely to get away with a crime if they knew more about the officers in their community. That is, when police officers were less anonymous, offenders were less likely to go forward with a crime.\r\nIn the second phase a field intervention was developed and conducted to test whether reducing officer anonymity might deter crime. Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) while working with NYPD neighborhood coordination officers, who work in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments, it was tested whether sending information about officers to residents in housing developments would deter crime in those developments.",

This research project will meet these goals by implementing and evaluating a restorative justice school safety initiative that: 1) reduces bullying perpetration and victimization, aggression, and violence, 2) enhances school safety and mental health in middle and high school students, and 3) reduces the school to prison pipeline by diverting first offenders from the juvenile justice system into Teen Courts. In meeting this objective, we will implement and evaluate an innovative school safety initiative that includes a comprehensive school-based needs assessments using the School Success Profile-Plus (SSP+) student reporting system. In addition, Teen Courts will be implemented in schools to emphasize restorative justice, keep first time offenders out of the juvenile justice system, and reduce the school to prison pipeline. We will evaluate the efficacy of this restorative justice initiative for promoting school safety and reducing violence, by conducting a rigorous experimental trial of 24 middle- and high-schools that are randomly selected to either conduct SSP+ assessments and receive school-based Teen Courts (n=12) or to conduct SSP+ assessments without Teen Court programming (n=12).",

These datasets were used to compare what characteristics (individual or building level) either increase or decrease the odds that a student will become involved with the criminal justice system, as a result of school behaviors. The qualitative study involved in-depth individual interviews with 34 educational stakeholders across Virginia, who are involved in the discipline process in the schools (e.g. administrators, counselors, School Resource Officers). The analysis of these interviews found that the themes in how school discipline is differentiated from law enforcement in the schools, and the efforts that schools communities are making to keep children in the classroom and out of the courtroom.

In light of these consistent conclusions, it is important that research extend the current state of knowledge by addressing other important empirical questions. One is the question of how correctional officer stress levels affect the well-being of the officer, as measured in terms of potential (1) attitudinal, (2) emotional and (3) behavioral effects on the officer. A second question is the extent to which correctional officer stress levels affect the well-being of the prison organization. Research in non-correctional settings finds that increased levels of a worker's stress are significantly related to three dimensions of that worker's behaviors in the organization:  (1) task performance, (2) organizational citizenship behaviors, and (3) counterproductive work behaviors. A third question explored is the degree to which the individual-level effects of stress mediate the organizational-level effects of stress. Finally, a fourth question to be explored is the extent to which officer stress levels are correlated with, and can be predicted by, data routinely collected by the state department of corrections, such as performance evaluations, workplace injuries, overtime, grievances, and incident reports.",

Family courts' errors in assessing adult and child abuse, and punitive responses to abuse allegations, have been widely documented. A significant contributor to these errors is the pseudo-scientific theory of parental alienation (PA). Originally termed parental alienation syndrome (PAS), the theory suggests that when mothers allege that a child is not safe with the father, they are doing so illegitimately, to alienate the child from the father. PA labeling often results in dismissal of women's and children's reports of abuse, and sometimes trumps even expert child abuse evaluations. PAS was explicitly based on negative stereotypes of mothers and has been widely discredited. However, the term parental alienation is still widely used in ways that are virtually identical to PAS. However, because PA is nominally gender neutral (and not called a scientific syndrome), it continues to have substantial credibility in court.\r\nThe first goal of the study was to ascertain whether empirical evidence indicated that parental alienation is also gender-biased in practice and outcome. Drawing from courts' own reports of facts, findings, and outcomes, such research could inform advocates and the courts regarding the validity or invalidity of relying on PA to strip mothers of their children and potentially subject children to ongoing abuse. Second, inspired by some tentative findings, the study sought to explore outcomes in custody/abuse litigation by gender and by differing types of abuse. The study relied solely on electronically available published opinions in child custody cases; to date, the researchers have identified 240 cases involving alienation and alienation plus abuse. The researchers sought to expand the database to include non-alienation abuse cases as a comparison, and to address additional questions about custody/abuse adjudications.",

The\r\n name of the program, \"TEST,\" is both a reference to testing and an\r\n acronym representing the program's three objectives: (1) Testing to\r\n identify drug-involved defendants before their first court appearance,\r\n (2) Effective Sanctions when defendants on release were found to be\r\n using drugs, and (3) Treatment referrals for drug-using defendants, as\r\n needed. The program was based on the view that drug testing, when\r\n closely linked to sanctions and treatment placements in response to\r\n ongoing drug use, can reduce drug use among defendants on pretrial\r\n release. The overall goal of the program was to deter drug use and its\r\n adverse consequences among defendants on pretrial release. The\r\n purposes of the evaluation were to describe the process of program\r\n implementation and to document ODT's impact on sanctioning and\r\n treatment. Data for this evaluation were gathered from official\r\n records collected from the ODT database, which was maintained by the\r\n Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC). Parts 1 and\r\n 2 contain data from fiscal year 1998 for initial drug tests and\r\n subsequent drug tests, respectively. Data from fiscal year 1999 (Parts\r\n 3 and 4) were divided into two groups, depending on the model of ODT\r\n implementation and the stage at which initial drug testing took place.\r\n DOJ and AOUSC determined that districts could choose to implement the\r\n program under either of two models. Model 1 (Part 3) followed the\r\n original concept, namely, initial testing at the pre-bail stage. In\r\n Model 2 (Part 4), the initial test was to occur as soon as possible\r\n after the defendant's first court appearance, if he/she was being\r\n released, but before release into the community. Variables unique to\r\n Part 1 include date of birth, arrest date, initial hearing date,\r\n hearing date, decision date, and release date. Variables for all parts\r\n include the district name, its circuit and office, which model a\r\n defendant conformed to, current or prior drug charges, and drug\r\n history.

Physical and social\r\nconditions were assessed on residential face blocks surrounding a new\r\nsubdivision that was built as a revitalization effort. Data were\r\ncollected before and after the completion of the new subdivision to\r\nassess the effects of the subdivision and of more proximal social and\r\nphysical conditions on residents' blocks in order to understand\r\nimportant revitalization outcomes of crime, fear, and housing\r\nsatisfaction and conditions. The study also highlighted place\r\nattachment of residents as a psychological strength that deserved\r\ngreater attention. The research site consisted of a neighborhood\r\nlocated on the near west side of Salt Lake City that had been\r\nexperiencing gradual decline. The neighborhood surrounded a new\r\n84-unit single family detached housing subdivision, which was built in\r\n1995 with money from a HUD demonstration grant. The study began in\r\n1993 with a systematic observational assessment of crime and\r\nfear-related physical features on 59 blocks of the older neighborhood\r\nsurrounding the planned housing site and 8 sampled addresses on each\r\nblock, followed by interviews with surrounding block residents during\r\n1994-1995, interviews with residents in the newly built housing in\r\n1997, and interviews and physical condition assessments on the\r\nsurrounding blocks in 1998-1999. Police crime report and city\r\nbuilding permit data for the periods during and immediately following\r\nboth waves of data collection were obtained and matched to sample\r\naddresses. Variables in Parts 1 and 2, Environmental and Survey Data\r\nfor Older Subdivision, focus on distance of respondent's home to the\r\nsubdivision, psychological proximity to the subdivision, if new\r\nhousing was in the respondent's neighborhood, nonresidential\r\nproperties on the block, physical incivilities, self-reported past\r\nvictimization, fear of crime, place attachment, collective efficacy\r\n(neighboring, participation, social control, sense of community),\r\nrating of neighborhood qualities, whether block neighbors had improved\r\nproperty, community confidence, perceived block crime problems,\r\nobserved conditions, self-reported home repairs and improvements,\r\nbuilding permits, and home satisfaction. Demographic variables for\r\nParts 1 and 2 include income, home ownership, ethnicity, religion,\r\ngender, age, marital status, if the resident lived in a house,\r\nhousehold size, number of children in the household, and length of\r\nresidence. Variables in Part 3, Environmental and Survey Data for\r\nIntervention Site, include neighborhood qualities and convenience,\r\nwhether the respondent's children would attend a local school, and\r\nvariables similar to those in Parts 1 and 2.

The primary question motivating this research was:\r\nCan the criminal justice system help to heal the harm of the\r\nbereaved's loss? The three main goals of this study were to examine:\r\n(1) bereaveds' perceptions of and experiences with the criminal\r\njustice system and its professionals, (2) the ways criminal justice\r\nprofessionals perceive and manage the bereaved, and (3) the nature of\r\nthe association between the criminal justice system and bereaveds'\r\npsychological well-being. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews\r\nconducted in June through December 2000 with two different groups of\r\npeople. The first group represented individuals who had lost loved\r\nones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts\r\n1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised county criminal\r\njustice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court\r\njudges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates).\r\nFor Parts 1-33, interviewees were asked a series of open-ended\r\nquestions about the criminal justice system, including how they\r\nlearned about the death and the current disposition of the murder\r\ncase. They also were asked what they would change about the criminal\r\njustice system's treatment of them. The bereaved were further asked\r\nabout their sex, age, race, education, marital status, employment\r\nstatus, income, and number of children. Additional questions were\r\nasked regarding the deceased's age at the time of the murder, race,\r\nrelationship to interviewee, and the deceased's relationship to the\r\nmurderer, if known. For Parts 34-55, respondents were asked about\r\ntheir job titles, years in those positions, number of murder cases\r\nhandled in the past year, number of murder cases handled over the\r\ncourse of their career, and whether they thought the criminal justice\r\nsystem could help to heal the harm of people who had lost loved ones\r\nto murder. All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later\r\ntranscribed by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of\r\nindividuals, neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other\r\nidentifiable names with pseudonyms.",

The primary question motivating this research was:\r\nCan the criminal justice system help to heal the harm of the\r\nbereaved's loss? The three main goals of this study were to examine:\r\n(1) bereaveds' perceptions of and experiences with the criminal\r\njustice system and its professionals, (2) the ways criminal justice\r\nprofessionals perceive and manage the bereaved, and (3) the nature of\r\nthe association between the criminal justice system and bereaveds'\r\npsychological well-being. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews\r\nconducted in June through December 2000 with two different groups of\r\npeople. The first group represented individuals who had lost loved\r\nones to murder between 1994 and 1998 in one county in Texas (Parts\r\n1-33). The second group (Parts 34-55) was comprised county criminal\r\njustice professionals (murder detectives, prosecutors, criminal court\r\njudges, victim's service counselors, and victim's rights advocates).\r\nFor Parts 1-33, interviewees were asked a series of open-ended\r\nquestions about the criminal justice system, including how they\r\nlearned about the death and the current disposition of the murder\r\ncase. They also were asked what they would change about the criminal\r\njustice system's treatment of them. The bereaved were further asked\r\nabout their sex, age, race, education, marital status, employment\r\nstatus, income, and number of children. Additional questions were\r\nasked regarding the deceased's age at the time of the murder, race,\r\nrelationship to interviewee, and the deceased's relationship to the\r\nmurderer, if known. For Parts 34-55, respondents were asked about\r\ntheir job titles, years in those positions, number of murder cases\r\nhandled in the past year, number of murder cases handled over the\r\ncourse of their career, and whether they thought the criminal justice\r\nsystem could help to heal the harm of people who had lost loved ones\r\nto murder. All interviews (Parts 1-55) were tape-recorded and later\r\ntranscribed by the interviewer, who replaced actual names of\r\nindividuals, neighborhoods, cities, counties, or any other\r\nidentifiable names with pseudonyms.",

Spectrum Behavioral Services, Inc. (SBC) was subcontracted to\r\nimplement the program, which was located at the Maine Correctional\r\nFacility in South Windham and the Pre-Release Center in Hallowell. The\r\nUnited States Department of Justice Residential Substance Abuse\r\nTreatment (RSAT) funded the initiative. This study was undertaken as a\r\nprocess evaluation of the program. To accomplish the aims of the\r\nprocess evaluation, research staff examined both program and\r\nclient-level data that were collected throughout the first 15 months\r\nof the Key Maine TC's operation, a period that included the initial\r\nstart-up period for the TTP. Part 1, Baseline Data, contains\r\ninformation on inmates, including age, ethnic group, education level,\r\ntiming of all diplomas or degrees they had received, reasons for\r\nstopping school, marital and/or relationship status and history, and\r\nnumber and ages of children. The file also includes information on the\r\nlast six months before being incarcerated, such as attendance at\r\nreligious services, kind of housing and time spent there, as well as\r\nwhom they lived with and the behavior of the inmate and their living\r\ncompanions in terms of alcohol and drug use. Also, there is\r\ninformation about how respondents supported themselves financially,\r\nincluding employment status and job information, such as number of\r\ndays worked, number of jobs, part-time or full-time status, income,\r\nsupplemental income, drug and alcohol use effects on employment, and\r\nwhether they had dependants to support. In addition to information on\r\nthe six months before incarceration, the file provides information on\r\nthe inmate's substance abuse behaviors over his lifetime, including\r\nspecific drugs used, the frequency used, and the age at which use of\r\nparticular substances began. Information on substance abuse behaviors,\r\nsuch as specific substances used and frequency used in the last 30\r\ndays, is also recorded. Other variables in Part 1 focus on whether\r\ninmates' substance abuse had caused problems in major areas of their\r\nlives, such as family, employment, school, physical and mental health,\r\nrelationships, and other substance abuse treatment received, including\r\nthe type of treatment, duration of treatment, main substance abused,\r\nand reasons for entering treatment. Self-report data are available on\r\neach inmate's lifetime history of illegal activities, including, but\r\nnot limited to, arrest history. This includes the offense(s) for which\r\nthe inmate was currently serving time, as well as past offenses, jail\r\ntime served, number of times incarcerated, illegal activities in which\r\nthe inmate engaged during the last six months before incarceration,\r\nand time spent in probation during the last six months before\r\nincarceration. Information on visitors received during time in jail\r\nand contact (phone calls and letters) with others while in jail are\r\nincluded, as well as personal history information concerning the\r\ninmate's relationship with family and the activities they engaged in\r\ntogether. There is information on the friends the inmate had during\r\nthe six months before incarceration, such as their education level,\r\nemployment status, and relationship with family. Additional variables\r\ninclude whether the inmate reported having a history of child abuse,\r\nwith details such as age at time of abuse, relationship with the\r\nabuser, frequency of abuse, perceived association of child abuse\r\nhistory to the inmate's substance abuse, the inmate's history as both\r\nvictim of and perpetrator of violent crimes and weapon use, the\r\ninmate's sexual activity during the six months before incarceration,\r\nand his opinions about the chances of contracting HIV/AIDS. Other\r\nitems pertain to behaviors that increase the risk of contracting\r\nHIV/AIDS and the inmates' feelings about HIV/AIDS, such as whether\r\nthey worried about contracting the virus, whether they would want to\r\nknow if they had the virus, whether they knew how to protect\r\nthemselves, whether they had altered their behavior to reduce their\r\nchances of infection, and their perceptions regarding the likelihood\r\nof contracting HIV/AIDS. Part 1 data also provide information on\r\ninmates' physical and mental health, along with medications taken and\r\ndiagnosed mental disorders. Interviewers' ratings concerning the\r\ninmates' behavior during the interview and whether the interviewer\r\nbelieved the inmates would complete the program are assessed across 16\r\nareas. Part 2, Retention Data, indicates how long inmates spent in the\r\nprogram and the reason for their discharge. Part 3, Score Data,\r\nprovides the inmates' psychological and motivational scores for the\r\nshort self-esteem index, the short depression index, motivation and\r\nreadiness and treatment engagement, and when they were tested. Also\r\nincluded are scores for counselor rapport and counselor\r\ncompetence. Part 4, Services Data, records the number of times an\r\ninmate had used particular services, such as clinical groups, clinical\r\nsupervision, educational sessions, encounter groups, group counseling\r\nsessions, individual counseling sessions, seminars, and 12-step\r\nsessions.",

-            "description": "The Colorado Springs Police Department formed a\r\n nontraditional domestic violence unit in 1996 called the Domestic\r\n Violence Enhanced Response Team (DVERT). This unit involved a\r\n partnership and collaboration with the Center for the Prevention of\r\n Domestic Violence, a private, nonprofit victim advocacy organization,\r\n and 25 other city and county agencies. DVERT was unique in its focus\r\n on the safety of the victim over the arrest and prosecution of the\r\n batterer. It was also different from the traditional police model for\r\n a special unit because it was a systemic response to domestic violence\r\n situations that involved the coordination of criminal justice, social\r\n service, and community-based agencies. This study is an 18-month\r\n evaluation of the DVERT unit. It was designed to answer the following\r\n research and evaluation questions: (1) What were the activities of\r\n DVERT staff? (2) Who were the victims and perpetrators of domestic\r\n violence? (3) What were the characteristics of domestic\r\n violence-related incidents in Colorado Springs and surrounding\r\n jurisdictions? (4) What was the nature of the intervention and\r\n prevention activities of DVERT? (5) What were the effects of the\r\n intervention? (6) What was the nature and extent of the collaboration\r\n among criminal justice agencies, victim advocates, and city and county\r\n human services agencies? (7) What were the dynamics of the\r\n collaboration? and (8) How successful was the collaboration? At the\r\n time of this evaluation, the DVERT program focused on three levels of\r\n domestic violence situations: Level I included the most lethal\r\n situations in which a victim might be in serious danger, Level II\r\n included moderately lethal situations in which the victim was not in\r\n immediate danger, and Level III included lower lethality situations in\r\n which patrol officers engaged in problem-solving. Domestic violence\r\n situations came to the attention of DVERT through a variety of\r\n mechanisms. Most of the referrals came from the Center for the\r\n Prevention of Domestic Violence. Other referrals came from the\r\n Department of Human Services, the Humane Society, other law\r\n enforcement agencies, or city service agencies. Once a case was\r\n referred to DVERT, all relevant information concerning criminal and\r\n prosecution histories, advocacy, restraining orders, and human\r\n services documentation was researched by appropriate DVERT member\r\n agencies. Referral decisions were made on a weekly basis by a group\r\n of six to eight representatives from the partner agencies. From its\r\n inception in May 1996 to December 31, 1999, DVERT accepted 421 Level I\r\n cases and 541 Level II cases. Cases were closed or deactivated when\r\n DVERT staff believed that the client was safe from harm. Parts 1-4\r\n contain data from 285 Level I DVERT cases that were closed between\r\n July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1999. Parts 5-8 contain data from 515\r\n Level II cases from 1998 and 1999 only, because data were more\r\n complete in those two years. Data were collected from (1) police\r\n records of the perpetrator and victim, including calls for service,\r\n arrest reports, and criminal histories, (2) DVERT case files,\r\n and (3) Center for the Prevention of Domestic Violence files on\r\n victims. Coding sheets were developed to capture the information\r\n within these administrative documents. Part 1 includes data on whether\r\n the incident produced injuries or a risk to children, whether the\r\n victim, children, or animals were threatened, whether weapons were\r\n used, if there was stalking or sexual abuse, prior criminal history,\r\n and whether there was a violation of a restraining order. For Part 2\r\n data were gathered on the date of case acceptance to the DVERT program\r\n and deactivation, if the offender was incarcerated, if the victim was\r\n in a new relationship or had moved out of the area, if the offender\r\n had moved or was in treatment, if the offender had completed a\r\n domestic violence class, and if the offender had served a\r\n sentence. Parts 3 and 4 contain information on the race, date of\r\n birth, gender, employment, and relationship to the victim or offender\r\n for the offenders and victims, respectively. Part 5 includes data on\r\n the history of emotional, physical, sexual, and child abuse, prior\r\n arrests, whether the victim took some type of action against the\r\n offender, whether substance abuse was involved, types of injuries that\r\n the victim sustained, whether medical care was necessary, whether a\r\n weapon was used, restraining order violations, and incidents of\r\n harassment, criminal trespassing, telephone threats, or\r\n kidnapping. Part 6 variables include whether the case was referred to\r\n and accepted in Level I and whether a DVERT advocate made contact on\r\n the case. Part 7 contains information on the offenders' race and\r\n gender. Part 8 includes data on the victims' date of birth, race, and\r\ngender.",

It was also different from the traditional police model for\r\n a special unit because it was a systemic response to domestic violence\r\n situations that involved the coordination of criminal justice, social\r\n service, and community-based agencies. This study is an 18-month\r\n evaluation of the DVERT unit. It was designed to answer the following\r\n research and evaluation questions: (1) What were the activities of\r\n DVERT staff? (2) Who were the victims and perpetrators of domestic\r\n violence? (3) What were the characteristics of domestic\r\n violence-related incidents in Colorado Springs and surrounding\r\n jurisdictions? (4) What was the nature of the intervention and\r\n prevention activities of DVERT? (5) What were the effects of the\r\n intervention? (6) What was the nature and extent of the collaboration\r\n among criminal justice agencies, victim advocates, and city and county\r\n human services agencies? (7) What were the dynamics of the\r\n collaboration? and (8) How successful was the collaboration? At the\r\n time of this evaluation, the DVERT program focused on three levels of\r\n domestic violence situations: Level I included the most lethal\r\n situations in which a victim might be in serious danger, Level II\r\n included moderately lethal situations in which the victim was not in\r\n immediate danger, and Level III included lower lethality situations in\r\n which patrol officers engaged in problem-solving. Domestic violence\r\n situations came to the attention of DVERT through a variety of\r\n mechanisms. Most of the referrals came from the Center for the\r\n Prevention of Domestic Violence. Other referrals came from the\r\n Department of Human Services, the Humane Society, other law\r\n enforcement agencies, or city service agencies. Once a case was\r\n referred to DVERT, all relevant information concerning criminal and\r\n prosecution histories, advocacy, restraining orders, and human\r\n services documentation was researched by appropriate DVERT member\r\n agencies. Referral decisions were made on a weekly basis by a group\r\n of six to eight representatives from the partner agencies. From its\r\n inception in May 1996 to December 31, 1999, DVERT accepted 421 Level I\r\n cases and 541 Level II cases. Cases were closed or deactivated when\r\n DVERT staff believed that the client was safe from harm. Parts 1-4\r\n contain data from 285 Level I DVERT cases that were closed between\r\n July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1999. Parts 5-8 contain data from 515\r\n Level II cases from 1998 and 1999 only, because data were more\r\n complete in those two years. Data were collected from (1) police\r\n records of the perpetrator and victim, including calls for service,\r\n arrest reports, and criminal histories, (2) DVERT case files,\r\n and (3) Center for the Prevention of Domestic Violence files on\r\n victims. Coding sheets were developed to capture the information\r\n within these administrative documents. Part 1 includes data on whether\r\n the incident produced injuries or a risk to children, whether the\r\n victim, children, or animals were threatened, whether weapons were\r\n used, if there was stalking or sexual abuse, prior criminal history,\r\n and whether there was a violation of a restraining order. For Part 2\r\n data were gathered on the date of case acceptance to the DVERT program\r\n and deactivation, if the offender was incarcerated, if the victim was\r\n in a new relationship or had moved out of the area, if the offender\r\n had moved or was in treatment, if the offender had completed a\r\n domestic violence class, and if the offender had served a\r\n sentence. Parts 3 and 4 contain information on the race, date of\r\n birth, gender, employment, and relationship to the victim or offender\r\n for the offenders and victims, respectively. Part 5 includes data on\r\n the history of emotional, physical, sexual, and child abuse, prior\r\n arrests, whether the victim took some type of action against the\r\n offender, whether substance abuse was involved, types of injuries that\r\n the victim sustained, whether medical care was necessary, whether a\r\n weapon was used, restraining order violations, and incidents of\r\n harassment, criminal trespassing, telephone threats, or\r\n kidnapping. Part 6 variables include whether the case was referred to\r\n and accepted in Level I and whether a DVERT advocate made contact on\r\n the case. Part 7 contains information on the offenders' race and\r\n gender. Part 8 includes data on the victims' date of birth, race, and\r\ngender.",

The NSFH was designed to cover a broad range of family\r\nstructures, processes, and relationships with a large enough sample to\r\npermit subgroup analysis.

Since the study\r\ndesign included oversamples of previously understudied groups (i.e.,\r\nBlacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans), racial and ethnic comparisons were\r\npossible. In both waves of the NSFH several identical questions were\r\nasked regarding marital conflicts. Both married and cohabiting\r\nrespondents were asked how often they used various tactics including\r\nheated arguments and hitting or throwing things at each other to\r\nresolve their conflicts. In addition, respondents were asked if any of\r\ntheir arguments became physical, how many of their fights resulted in\r\neither the respondent or their partner hitting, shoving, or throwing\r\nthings, and if any injuries resulted as a consequence of these\r\nfights. This data collection consists of the SPSS syntax used to\r\nrecode variables from the original NSFH dataset. In addition, new\r\nvariables, including both composite variables (e.g., self-esteem,\r\nhostility, depression) and husband and wife versions of the variables\r\n(using information from both respondent and partner), were\r\nconstructed. New variables were grouped into the following categories:\r\ndemographic, personality, alcohol and drug use, relationship stages,\r\ngender role attitudes, division of labor, fairness in household\r\nchores, social support, and isolation. Psychological well-being scales\r\nwere created to measure autonomy, positive relations with others,\r\npurpose in life, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and personal\r\ngrowth. Additional scales were created to measure relationship\r\nconflict, sex role gender attitudes, personal mastery, alcohol use,\r\nand hostility. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and the Center for\r\nEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were also utilized.",

In addition, respondents were asked if any of\r\ntheir arguments became physical, how many of their fights resulted in\r\neither the respondent or their partner hitting, shoving, or throwing\r\nthings, and if any injuries resulted as a consequence of these\r\nfights. This data collection consists of the SPSS syntax used to\r\nrecode variables from the original NSFH dataset. In addition, new\r\nvariables, including both composite variables (e.g., self-esteem,\r\nhostility, depression) and husband and wife versions of the variables\r\n(using information from both respondent and partner), were\r\nconstructed. New variables were grouped into the following categories:\r\ndemographic, personality, alcohol and drug use, relationship stages,\r\ngender role attitudes, division of labor, fairness in household\r\nchores, social support, and isolation. Psychological well-being scales\r\nwere created to measure autonomy, positive relations with others,\r\npurpose in life, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and personal\r\ngrowth. Additional scales were created to measure relationship\r\nconflict, sex role gender attitudes, personal mastery, alcohol use,\r\nand hostility. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and the Center for\r\nEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were also utilized.",

Moreover, researchers wanted\r\nto determine whether (1) prosecution without the victim's cooperation\r\nwas feasible with appropriate increases in resources, (2) implementing\r\na no-drop policy resulted in increased convictions and fewer\r\ndismissals, (3) the number of trials would increase in jurisdictions\r\nwhere no-drop was adopted as a result of the prosecutor's demand for a\r\nplea in cases in which victims were uncooperative or unavailable, and\r\n(4) prosecutors would have to downgrade sentence demands to persuade\r\ndefense attorneys to negotiate pleas in the new context of a no-drop\r\npolicy. Statutes implemented in San Diego, California, were designed\r\nto make it easier to admit certain types of evidence and thereby to\r\nincrease the prosecutor's chances of succeeding in trials without\r\nvictim cooperation. To assess the impact of these statutes,\r\nresearchers collected official records data on a sample of domestic\r\nviolence cases in which disposition occurred between 1996 and 2000 and\r\nresulted in no trial (Part 1), and cases in which disposition occurred\r\nbetween 1996 and 1999, and resulted in a trial (Part 2). In Everett,\r\nWashington (Part 3), Klamath Falls, Oregon (Part 4), and Omaha,\r\nNebraska (Part 5), researchers collected data on all domestic violence\r\ncases in which disposition occurred between 1996 and 1999 and resulted\r\nin a trial. Researchers also conducted telephone interviews in the\r\nfour sites with domestic violence victims whose cases resolved under\r\nthe no-drop policy (Part 6) in the four sites. Variables for Part 1\r\ninclude defendant's gender, court outcome, whether the defendant was\r\nsentenced to probation, jail, or counseling, and whether the\r\ncounseling was for batterer, drug, or anger management. Criminal\r\nhistory, other domestic violence charges, and the relationship between\r\nthe victim and defendant are also included. Variables for Part 2\r\ninclude length of trial and outcome, witnesses for the prosecution,\r\ndefendant's statements to the police, whether there were photos of the\r\nvictim's injury, the scene, or the weapon, and whether medical experts\r\ntestified. Criminal history and whether the defendant underwent\r\npsychological evaluation or counseling are also included. Variables\r\nfor Parts 3-5 include the gender of the victim and defendant,\r\nrelationship between victim and defendant, top charges and outcomes,\r\nwhether the victim had to be subpoenaed, types of witnesses, if there\r\nwas medical evidence, type of weapon used, if any, whether the\r\ndefendant confessed, any indications that the prosecutor talked to the\r\nvictim, if the victim was in court on the disposition date, the\r\ndefendant's sentence, and whether the sentence included electronic\r\nsurveillance, public service, substance abuse counseling, or other\r\ngeneral counseling. Variables for Part 6 include relationship between\r\nvictim and defendant, whether the victim wanted the defendant to be\r\narrested, whether the defendant received treatment for alcohol, drugs,\r\nor domestic violence, if the court ordered the defendant to stay away\r\nfrom the victim, and if the victim spoke to anyone in the court\r\nsystem, such as the prosecutor, detective, victim advocate, defense\r\nattorney, judge, or a probation officer. The victim's satisfaction with\r\nthe police, judge, prosecutor, and the justice system, and whether the\r\ndefendant had continued to threaten, damage property, or abuse the\r\nvictim verbally or physically are also included.

The program provided grants to states to be used to\r\nincrease the capacity of state correctional systems to confine serious\r\nand violent offenders. This national evaluation addressed four broad\r\nareas: (1) How had the federal government implemented the law? How\r\nmuch money had been made available and what were the criteria for\r\ndisbursement? (2) How had the states reacted legislatively to the law?\r\nDid states adopt truth-in-sentencing or statutes having equivalent\r\neffect? (3) How had the state VOI/TIS money been spent and for what?\r\nHow much did it increased prison capacities? (4) Did the law increase\r\nthe number of admissions, length of sentences, and terms served for\r\nviolent offenders? In addition to these four major areas, the study\r\nlooked at related areas of interest, such as the impact of VOI/TIS and\r\nother \"get tough\" legislation on prosecutorial and judicial attitudes,\r\npolicies, and practices. It also examined state spending on\r\ncorrections, particularly for construction. The researchers\r\ncollaborated with the American Correctional Association (ACA), the\r\nAmerican Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI), and the Justice\r\nManagement Institute (JMI) to conduct special surveys among state\r\ncorrectional officials, prosecutors, and judges. The ACA surveyed\r\nstate departments of correction in the summer of 1998. States were\r\nasked to indicate the extent of changes in a number of prison\r\noperations and activities since 1996, when VOI/TIS funds became\r\navailable. In the summer of 1999 the APRI surveyed prosecutors\r\nnationwide to ascertain their perceptions of the effects of \"get\r\ntough\" legislation (including TIS) on a number of dimensions. In the\r\nfall of 1999, the JMI surveyed judges nationwide on their impressions\r\nof the effectiveness of several \"get tough\" measures in their states,\r\nincluding VOI/TIS. In Part 1, American Correctional Association Survey\r\nData, state correction departments were questioned on the amount of\r\nVOI/TIS funds spent by their state since 1996, number of beds added\r\nusing VOI/TIS funds and in what types of facilities, how VOI/TIS funds\r\nwere used to increase number of beds, average prison sentences in 1993\r\nand 1998 for different types of offenses, average time actually served\r\nin 1993 and 1998 for those offenses, the effects of VOI/TIS on prison\r\nand jail admissions for different types of offenders, and its effects\r\non the composition of the prison population, prison inmate activities\r\nand programs, prison staffing, and prison operations. In Part 2,\r\nAmerican Prosecutors Research Institute Survey Data, prosecutors were\r\nquestioned about what \"get tough\" policies their states had enacted,\r\nthe efficacy of \"get tough\" policies in achieving their goals, whether\r\nthese policies had unanticipated or negative consequences, expected\r\nresults of these policies, the percentage of cases to which these\r\npolicies applied, the extent to which these policies had helped\r\naccomplish their office's goals, the effects of \"get tough\" policies\r\non budget and resources, sentences and time actually served, and the\r\ncriminal justice process, the size of their jurisdiction, and the\r\nnumber of staff in their office. In Part 3, Justice Management\r\nInstitute Survey Data, judges were questioned about whether their\r\nstate had enacted \"get tough\" policies in the past ten years, what\r\nkinds of policies were adopted, their effect on the efficiency of case\r\nprocessing, the formal positions of the Judicial Council and Judges\r\nAssociation on the policies, whether the respondent or other judges\r\nhad input into the policies, how likely \"get tough\" policies were to\r\nachieve certain goals, what results the respondent expected from the\r\npolicies, the impact of the policies on the criminal justice process,\r\nyears experience on the bench, the percentage of their caseload that\r\ninvolved criminal cases, whether they handled civil, family\r\nlaw/domestic relations, or juvenile cases, and the population of their\r\njurisdiction.",

The program provided grants to states to be used to\r\nincrease the capacity of state correctional systems to confine serious\r\nand violent offenders. This national evaluation addressed four broad\r\nareas: (1) How had the federal government implemented the law? How\r\nmuch money had been made available and what were the criteria for\r\ndisbursement? (2) How had the states reacted legislatively to the law?\r\nDid states adopt truth-in-sentencing or statutes having equivalent\r\neffect? (3) How had the state VOI/TIS money been spent and for what?\r\nHow much did it increased prison capacities? (4) Did the law increase\r\nthe number of admissions, length of sentences, and terms served for\r\nviolent offenders?

Victim assistance programs came\r\n into being when it was discovered that, in addition to the physical,\r\n emotional, and financial impact of a crime, victims often experience a\r\n \"second victimization\" because of insensitive treatment by the\r\n criminal justice system. Specifically, this study sought to answer the\r\n following questions: (1) What are the current staffing levels of\r\n victim assistance programs? (2) What types of victims come to the\r\n attention of the programs? (3) What types of services are provided to\r\n victims? and (4) What are the operational and training needs of victim\r\n assistance programs? The survey was sent to 519 police departments,\r\n sheriff departments, and prosecutor's offices identified as having\r\n victim assistance programs. Also, 172 independent full-service\r\n agencies that were believed to provide referral or direct services to\r\n victims (not just advocacy) were also sent surveys. Variables on\r\n staffing levels include the number of full-time, part-time, and\r\n volunteer personnel, and the education and years of experience of paid\r\n staff. Victim information includes the number of victims served for\r\n various types of crime, and the percent of victims served identified\r\n by race/ethnicity and by age characteristics (under 16 years old,\r\n 17-64 years old, and over 65 years old). Variables about services\r\n include percent estimates on the number of victims receiving various\r\n types of assistance, such as information on their rights, information\r\n on criminal justice processes, \"next-day\" crisis counseling,\r\n short-term supportive counseling, or transportation. Other data\r\n gathered include the number of victims for which the agency arranged\r\n emergency loans, accompanied to line-ups, police or prosecutor\r\n interviews, or court, assisted in applying for state victim\r\n compensation, prepared victim impact statements, notified of court\r\n dates or parole hearings, or made referrals to social service agencies\r\n or mental health agencies. Information is also presented on training\r\n provided to criminal justice, medical, mental health, or other victim\r\n assistance agency personnel, and whether the agency conducted\r\n community or public school education programs. Agencies ranked their\r\n need for more timely victim notification of various criminal justice\r\n events, improvement or implementation of various forms of victim and\r\n public protection, and improvement of victim participation in various\r\n stages of the criminal justice process. Agencies also provided\r\n information on training objectives for their agency, number of hours\r\n of mandatory pre-service and in-service training, types of information\r\n provided during the training of their staff, sources for their\r\n training, and the priority of additional types of training for their\r\n staff. Agency variables include type of agency, year started, and\r\nbudget information.",

Victim assistance programs came\r\n into being when it was discovered that, in addition to the physical,\r\n emotional, and financial impact of a crime, victims often experience a\r\n \"second victimization\" because of insensitive treatment by the\r\n criminal justice system. Specifically, this study sought to answer the\r\n following questions: (1) What are the current staffing levels of\r\n victim assistance programs? (2) What types of victims come to the\r\n attention of the programs? (3) What types of services are provided to\r\n victims? and (4) What are the operational and training needs of victim\r\n assistance programs? The survey was sent to 519 police departments,\r\n sheriff departments, and prosecutor's offices identified as having\r\n victim assistance programs. Also, 172 independent full-service\r\n agencies that were believed to provide referral or direct services to\r\n victims (not just advocacy) were also sent surveys. Variables on\r\n staffing levels include the number of full-time, part-time, and\r\n volunteer personnel, and the education and years of experience of paid\r\n staff. Victim information includes the number of victims served for\r\n various types of crime, and the percent of victims served identified\r\n by race/ethnicity and by age characteristics (under 16 years old,\r\n 17-64 years old, and over 65 years old). Variables about services\r\n include percent estimates on the number of victims receiving various\r\n types of assistance, such as information on their rights, information\r\n on criminal justice processes, \"next-day\" crisis counseling,\r\n short-term supportive counseling, or transportation. Other data\r\n gathered include the number of victims for which the agency arranged\r\n emergency loans, accompanied to line-ups, police or prosecutor\r\n interviews, or court, assisted in applying for state victim\r\n compensation, prepared victim impact statements, notified of court\r\n dates or parole hearings, or made referrals to social service agencies\r\n or mental health agencies. Information is also presented on training\r\n provided to criminal justice, medical, mental health, or other victim\r\n assistance agency personnel, and whether the agency conducted\r\n community or public school education programs. Agencies ranked their\r\n need for more timely victim notification of various criminal justice\r\n events, improvement or implementation of various forms of victim and\r\n public protection, and improvement of victim participation in various\r\n stages of the criminal justice process. Agencies also provided\r\n information on training objectives for their agency, number of hours\r\n of mandatory pre-service and in-service training, types of information\r\n provided during the training of their staff, sources for their\r\n training, and the priority of additional types of training for their\r\n staff. Agency variables include type of agency, year started, and\r\nbudget information.",

One-sixth of the\r\n organization serving approximately one-sixth of the community was used\r\n as a test site for the new community policing approach.

For the first part of the program evaluation, attitude\r\n changes among officers working in the EPD were compared with those of\r\n officers working in the rest of the police department.

Part 2, Commissioned Personnel Data, Wave 2, consists of\r\n responses from 264 police officers who completed a Wave 2 survey in\r\n December 1988, and Part 3, Commissioned Personnel Data, Wave 3,\r\n supplies responses from 230 police officers who completed a Wave 3\r\n survey in December 1989. Although the analysis was to be based on a\r\n panel design, efforts were made to survey all commissioned personnel\r\n during each survey administration period. Police personnel provided\r\n their assessments on how successfully quality leadership had been\r\n implemented, the extent to which they worked closely with and received\r\n feedback from other officers, the amount of their interaction with\r\n detectives, the amount of time available for problem-solving, ease of\r\n arranging schedules, safety of working conditions, satisfaction with\r\n working conditions, type of work they performed, their supervisor,\r\n commitment to the department, attitudes related to community policing\r\n and problem-solving, perception of their relationship with the\r\n community, views of human nature, attitudes toward change, attitudes\r\n toward decentralization, and demographic information.

Data for Wave 1 consist of personal interviews with a random\r\n sample of 1,166 Madison residents in February and March 1988, prior to\r\n the opening of the EPD station. During the second wave, Wave 1\r\n respondents were interviewed by telephone in February and March\r\n 1990. Residents provided their perceptions of police presence,\r\n frequency and quality of police-citizen contacts, estimates of the\r\n magnitude of various problems in their neighborhoods, evaluation of\r\n the problem-solving efforts of the police, perception of neighborhood\r\n conditions, levels of fear of crime, personal experience of\r\n victimization, knowledge of victimization of other residents, and\r\ndemographic information.",

At the local level in each sampled county, survey\r\n questionnaires were distributed to police chiefs of the largest city,\r\n sheriffs, jail administrators, prosecutors, public defenders, chief\r\n trial court judges, trial court administrators (where applicable), and\r\n probation and parole agency heads. Data were collected at the state\r\n level through surveys sent to attorneys general, commissioners of\r\n corrections, prison wardens, state court administrators, and directors\r\n of probation and parole. For the 1992-1994 survey, 13 separate\r\n questionnaires were used. Police chiefs and sheriffs received the same\r\n survey instruments, with a screening procedure employed to identify\r\n sheriffs who handled law enforcement responsibilities. Of the 411\r\n counties selected, 264 counties also employed trial court\r\n administrators. Judges and trial court administrators received\r\n identical survey instruments. A total of 546 surveys were mailed to\r\n probation and parole agencies, with the same questions asked of state\r\n and local officers. Counties that had separate agencies for probation\r\n and parole were sent two surveys. All survey instruments were divided\r\n into sections on workload (except that the wardens, jail\r\n administrators, and corrections commissioners were sent a section on\r\n jail use and crowding instead), staffing, operations and procedures,\r\n and background. The staffing section of each survey queried\r\n respondents on recruitment, retention, training, and number of\r\n staff. The other sections varied from instrument to instrument, with\r\n questions tailored to the responsibilities of the particular\r\n agency. Most of the questionnaires asked about use of automated\r\n information systems, programs, policies, or aspects of the facility or\r\n security needing improvement, agency responsibilities and\r\n jurisdictions, factors contributing to workload increases, budget,\r\n number of fulltime employees and other staff, and contracted\r\n services. Questions specific to police chiefs and sheriffs included\r\n activities aimed at drug problems and whether they anticipated\r\n increases in authorized strength in officers. Jail administrators,\r\n corrections commissioners, and wardens were asked about factors\r\n contributing to jail crowding, alternatives to jail, medical services\r\n offered, drug testing and drug-related admissions, and inmate\r\n classification. Topics covered by the surveys for prosecutors, public\r\n defenders, judges, and state and trial court administrators included\r\n types of cases handled, case timeliness, diversion and sentencing\r\n alternatives, and court and jury management. State and local probation\r\n and parole agency directors were asked about diagnostic tools,\r\n contracted services, and drug testing. Attorneys general were queried\r\n about operational issues, statutory authority, and legal services and\r\nsupport provided to state and local criminal justice agencies.",

The goal of\r\nthe Denver NEPHU was to reduce the availability of narcotics in and\r\naround the city's public housing areas by increasing drug arrests.\r\nNEPHU's six full-time officers made investigations and gathered\r\nintelligence leading to on-street arrests and search warrants. The\r\nunit also operated a special telephone Drug Hotline and met regularly\r\nwith tenant councils in the developments to improve community\r\nrelations.

The\r\n objectives were to collect data on domestic violence in greater detail\r\n than previously possible, conduct various analyses on this\r\n information, and determine how the findings could best be used to\r\n improve the police, prosecutorial, and social service responses to\r\n domestic violence. Data for 1993 are a stratified random sample of\r\n reported domestic violence incidents occurring throughout the\r\n year. The sample represents approximately 27 percent of the domestic\r\n violence incidents reported in 1993 for the two districts studied, B3\r\n and D4. The 1994 data include all reported incidents occurring in the\r\n two districts during the period May to July. After the incident\r\n selection process was completed, data were collected from police\r\n incident reports, follow-up investigation reports, criminal history\r\n reports, and court dockets. Variables include arrest offenses, time of\r\n incident, location of incident, witnesses (including children), nature\r\n and extent of injuries, drug and alcohol use, history of similar\r\n incidents, whether there were restraining orders in effect, and basic\r\n demographic information on victims and offenders. Criminal history\r\n information was coded into five distinct categories: (1) violent\r\n offenses, (2) nonviolent offenses, (3) domestic violence offenses, (4)\r\ndrug/alcohol offenses, and (5) firearms offenses.",

The\r\n objectives were to collect data on domestic violence in greater detail\r\n than previously possible, conduct various analyses on this\r\n information, and determine how the findings could best be used to\r\n improve the police, prosecutorial, and social service responses to\r\n domestic violence. Data for 1993 are a stratified random sample of\r\n reported domestic violence incidents occurring throughout the\r\n year. The sample represents approximately 27 percent of the domestic\r\n violence incidents reported in 1993 for the two districts studied, B3\r\n and D4. The 1994 data include all reported incidents occurring in the\r\n two districts during the period May to July. After the incident\r\n selection process was completed, data were collected from police\r\n incident reports, follow-up investigation reports, criminal history\r\n reports, and court dockets. Variables include arrest offenses, time of\r\n incident, location of incident, witnesses (including children), nature\r\n and extent of injuries, drug and alcohol use, history of similar\r\n incidents, whether there were restraining orders in effect, and basic\r\n demographic information on victims and offenders. Criminal history\r\n information was coded into five distinct categories: (1) violent\r\n offenses, (2) nonviolent offenses, (3) domestic violence offenses, (4)\r\ndrug/alcohol offenses, and (5) firearms offenses.",

-            "description": "The purpose of this evaluation was to assess whether the STOP (Services/Training/Officers/Prosecution) Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program's financial support for direct victim services offered through private nonprofit victim service agencies helped victims of domestic violence and sexual assault improve their safety and well-being, and work successfully with the legal system and other relevant agencies.\r\nResearchers selected eight states whose state STOP agency had different levels of emphasis on creating collaborative structures in local service networks to help victims. Researchers collected information, as of November 15, 1999, about 201 nonprofit victim service agencies receiving STOP funding to deliver direct services, their services, and their community linkages. A Program Survey, Part\r\n1 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Fax to Subgrantees Data) and Part 2 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Telephone Interview with Subgrantees Data) completed in spring 2000 used telephone interviews with the person most knowledgeable about STOP-funded activities to obtain this information. The sample included 201 nonprofit victim service agencies that were nationally representative of all private nonprofit victim service agencies receiving STOP funds for direct services.\r\nAmong the purposes of the Program Survey data was selecting the communities in the eight focal states to include in the final stage of the study design -- the Help Seeker and the Community sample (Parts 3 and 4, respectively).\r\nThe Help Seeker (Part 3) sample consisted of 958 women recruited from nonprofit victim service and legal system agencies who had contacted those agencies for assistance related to experiences of domestic violence and/or sexual assault.\r\nThey were interviewed between June and October 2001.\r\nThe Community sample (Part 4) was a random sample of 673 women in their communities who were 18 to 35 years of age. The sample was selected using random digit dialing (RDD), screening for women aged 18 to 35 in the victim service program catchment area from which researchers drew the Help Seeker sample. The women in the Community sample were interviewed between November 2001 and February 2002.\r\nThe women's data were then linked to Program Survey data from their own community.  Across the 4 data files there are 2,947 variables.\r\nPart 1 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Fax to Subgrantees Data) contains information related to the role of the agency which received STOP funding, the characteristics of employees and volunteers of the agency, and the characteristics of victims the agency served. The data also include how many victims of domestic violence the agency assisted with obtaining protective/restraining orders and the number of victims helped through criminal justice advocacy activities.  The agency approximated how many referrals they received from other sources and how many referrals they made to other agencies/organizations. There were also questions related to the STOP grant(s) received by the agencies and the agencies were asked about their data collection and evaluation efforts and in what form this information was maintained.\r\nPart 2 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Telephone Interview with Subgrantees Data) contains background information regarding the agency and the respondent answering questions on behalf of the agency.  Respondents were also asked whether their agency conducted needs assessments to identify community needs with respect to violence against women, to identify service solutions to meet those needs, and to summarize their STOP project goals and activities.  The data file also includes questions about referrals and how their agency's STOP project related to other activities of the agency.  Additionally, the respondent answered questions related to the coordination and communication between their agency, law enforcement, prosecution, and victim service agencies.  There were also general community questions, and the respondent provided outreach information.  Respondents were also asked a series of questions about their agency's contact with the state STOP administrator.\r\nPart 3 (Study of Women's Services -- Help Seeker Sample Data) and Part 4 (Study of Women's Services -- Community Sample Data) asked women about their demographic background, their intimate relationships, the types of violence they had experienced with intimate partners, and whether or not they had been sexually assaulted and the circumstances around such experiences.  Respondents in these data files were also asked if they were familiar with the victim service agencies in their community.  In addition, the women were asked if they had used any victim service or legal system agencies in the community.  Also included is the extent to which respondents felt the staff of victim service and legal system agencies behaved positively or negatively toward them, how effective they found the help from the legal system to be, how helpful they found the activities provided by victim service agencies to be, and how much control they felt they had over the services provided from victim service and legal system agencies.  The respondents were also asked if they would ever use these agencies again if they needed to, how satisfied they were with the outcome of the legal system case, how satisfied they were with their lives in general, and how much social support they received from people in their lives.

Researchers collected information, as of November 15, 1999, about 201 nonprofit victim service agencies receiving STOP funding to deliver direct services, their services, and their community linkages. A Program Survey, Part\r\n1 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Fax to Subgrantees Data) and Part 2 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Telephone Interview with Subgrantees Data) completed in spring 2000 used telephone interviews with the person most knowledgeable about STOP-funded activities to obtain this information. The sample included 201 nonprofit victim service agencies that were nationally representative of all private nonprofit victim service agencies receiving STOP funds for direct services.\r\nAmong the purposes of the Program Survey data was selecting the communities in the eight focal states to include in the final stage of the study design -- the Help Seeker and the Community sample (Parts 3 and 4, respectively).\r\nThe Help Seeker (Part 3) sample consisted of 958 women recruited from nonprofit victim service and legal system agencies who had contacted those agencies for assistance related to experiences of domestic violence and/or sexual assault.\r\nThey were interviewed between June and October 2001.\r\nThe Community sample (Part 4) was a random sample of 673 women in their communities who were 18 to 35 years of age. The sample was selected using random digit dialing (RDD), screening for women aged 18 to 35 in the victim service program catchment area from which researchers drew the Help Seeker sample. The women in the Community sample were interviewed between November 2001 and February 2002.\r\nThe women's data were then linked to Program Survey data from their own community.  Across the 4 data files there are 2,947 variables.\r\nPart 1 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Fax to Subgrantees Data) contains information related to the role of the agency which received STOP funding, the characteristics of employees and volunteers of the agency, and the characteristics of victims the agency served. The data also include how many victims of domestic violence the agency assisted with obtaining protective/restraining orders and the number of victims helped through criminal justice advocacy activities.  The agency approximated how many referrals they received from other sources and how many referrals they made to other agencies/organizations. There were also questions related to the STOP grant(s) received by the agencies and the agencies were asked about their data collection and evaluation efforts and in what form this information was maintained.\r\nPart 2 (Victim Impact Program Survey -- Telephone Interview with Subgrantees Data) contains background information regarding the agency and the respondent answering questions on behalf of the agency.  Respondents were also asked whether their agency conducted needs assessments to identify community needs with respect to violence against women, to identify service solutions to meet those needs, and to summarize their STOP project goals and activities.  The data file also includes questions about referrals and how their agency's STOP project related to other activities of the agency.  Additionally, the respondent answered questions related to the coordination and communication between their agency, law enforcement, prosecution, and victim service agencies.  There were also general community questions, and the respondent provided outreach information.  Respondents were also asked a series of questions about their agency's contact with the state STOP administrator.\r\nPart 3 (Study of Women's Services -- Help Seeker Sample Data) and Part 4 (Study of Women's Services -- Community Sample Data) asked women about their demographic background, their intimate relationships, the types of violence they had experienced with intimate partners, and whether or not they had been sexually assaulted and the circumstances around such experiences.  Respondents in these data files were also asked if they were familiar with the victim service agencies in their community.  In addition, the women were asked if they had used any victim service or legal system agencies in the community.  Also included is the extent to which respondents felt the staff of victim service and legal system agencies behaved positively or negatively toward them, how effective they found the help from the legal system to be, how helpful they found the activities provided by victim service agencies to be, and how much control they felt they had over the services provided from victim service and legal system agencies.  The respondents were also asked if they would ever use these agencies again if they needed to, how satisfied they were with the outcome of the legal system case, how satisfied they were with their lives in general, and how much social support they received from people in their lives.

Eligibility for participation in the study was limited to adult women over the age of 17 who were Ahtna shareholders or descendents of Ahtna shareholders and who lived in one of eight Ahtna villages (Mentasta Lake, Chitina, Cantwell, Copper Center, Gulkana, Gakona, Tazlina, and Chistochina) in the Copper River Basin of Alaska. The Ahtna Corporation provided research staff with a list of 185 women who met the eligibiltiy criteria. The list from the Ahtna Corporation did not include individuals born after 1972 who had not yet inherited shares in the Ahtna Corporation. With the assistance of subjects and village officials, researchers utilized snowball sampling to identify female Ahtna descendents over the age of 17 within the region. These subjects were recruited through face-to-face contact with project staff. Each of the 185 women on the list of eligible participants that researchers received from the Ahtna Corporation was sent a personal letter in 2003 inviting her to participate in the study. Included in the letter was the interview consent form. A few weeks after mailing, research staff contacted those women who had responded to the mailing to review methods for completing the survey and begin scheduling interviews. Study participants completed the Main Victimization Survey (Part 1) (n = 109), and if the respondent reported a violent incident, a Detailed Physical Assault Incident Report (Part 2) (n = 186) was completed for each offender that had assaulted the survey respondent. All respondents were paid 25 dollars for their participation in the survey and all of the interviewers were female. The Main Victimization Survey (Part 1) includes variables about physical violence the respondent experienced as an adult, how many times the violence occured, and the relationship between the respondent and the offender. The survey also included questions about cultural identity, involvement in the community, and the respondent's living conditions. Demographic variables include marital status, employment, income, and alcohol use. Questions were also included to gather respondents' opinions on health and social services delivery to Ahtna women in the Copper River region. The Detailed Physical Assault Incident Report (Part 2) includes variables about the victim/offender relationship, the time and place of the victimization, the amount of physical harm done in the victimization, whether alcohol or other drugs were involved in the victimization, whether formal assistance (i.e., police, medical treatment) was sought, the victim's perceptions of and satisfaction with the formal system response, the reasons for reporting or not reporting the offense, and if the victim attempted to obtain shelter from further victimization.",

-            "description": "The Judicial Oversight Demonstration (JOD) was designed to test the feasibility and impact of a coordinated response to intimate partner violence (IPV) that involved the courts and justice agencies in a central role. The primary goals were to protect victim safety, hold offenders accountable, and reduce repeat offending. The two primary evaluation objectives were: (1) to test the impact of JOD interventions on victim safety, offender accountability, and recidivism, and (2) to learn from the experiences of well-qualified sites who were given resources and challenged to build a collaboration between the courts and community agencies to respond to intimate partner violence.  Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Washtenaw County, Michigan, participated in a quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of the program. IPV cases reaching disposition during the JOD were compared to similar cases reaching disposition in Lowell, Massachusetts, and Ingham County, Michigan. All IPV cases reaching disposition from approximately January 2003 to November 2004 (see Study Time Periods and Time Frames) were reviewed and included in the sample if appropriate. To be eligible for the sample, cases had to involve: (1) criminal IPV charges; (2) victims and offenders age 18 or older; and (3) victims and offenders who lived in the target jurisdiction at the time of case disposition. Cases that reached disposition more than a year after the incident were excluded to limit loss of data due to poor recall of the facts of the incident and police response. The evaluation design of JOD in Milwaukee differed from that of the other two sites. The evaluation in Milwaukee was based on a quasi-experimental comparison of offenders convicted of IPV and ordered to probation during JOD (January 1, 2001, to May 21, 2002) and before JOD (October 8, 1997, to December 21, 1999). This design was selected when early plans for an experimental design had to be abandoned and no comparable contemporaneous comparison group could be identified. Data for this evaluation were collected from court and prosecutors' records of case and defendant characteristics, probation files on offender supervision practices, and official records of rearrest, but do not include interviews with victims or offenders. This data collection has 20 data files containing 3,578 cases and 4,092 variables.  The data files contain information related to each site's Batterer Intervention Programs (Parts 1, 8, and 15), court data (Parts 2, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18), law enforcement (Parts 3, 11, and 17), and victim data (Parts 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 19).  The Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Washtenaw County, Michigan, Impact Evaluation Data (Part 7) include baseline and follow-up information for the offender and the victim.  The data file also contains Probation Supervision Performance Reports, Victim Services Logs, and Case Incident Fact Sheet information.  The Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Impact Evaluation Data (Part 20) include information related to the offender and the victim such as age, race, and sex, as well as arrest records including charges filed.",

+            "description": "The Judicial Oversight Demonstration (JOD) was designed to test the feasibility and impact of a coordinated response to intimate partner violence (IPV) that involved the courts and justice agencies in a central role. The primary goals were to protect victim safety, hold offenders accountable, and reduce repeat offending. The two primary evaluation objectives were: (1) to test the impact of JOD interventions on victim safety, offender accountability, and recidivism, and (2) to learn from the experiences of well-qualified sites who were given resources and challenged to build a collaboration between the courts and community agencies to respond to intimate partner violence.  Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Washtenaw County, Michigan, participated in a quasi-experimental evaluation of the impact of the program. IPV cases reaching disposition during the JOD were compared to similar cases reaching disposition in Lowell, Massachusetts, and Ingham County, Michigan. All IPV cases reaching disposition from approximately January 2003 to November 2004 (see Study Time Periods and Time Frames) were reviewed and included in the sample if appropriate. To be eligible for the sample, cases had to involve: (1) criminal IPV charges; (2) victims and offenders age 18 or older; and (3) victims and offenders who lived in the target jurisdiction at the time of case disposition. Cases that reached disposition more than a year after the incident were excluded to limit loss of data due to poor recall of the facts of the incident and police response. The evaluation design of JOD in Milwaukee differed from that of the other two sites. The evaluation in Milwaukee was based on a quasi-experimental comparison of offenders convicted of IPV and ordered to probation during JOD (January 1, 2001, to May 21, 2002) and before JOD (October 8, 1997, to December 21, 1999). This design was selected when early plans for an experimental design had to be abandoned and no comparable contemporaneous comparison group could be identified. Data for this evaluation were collected from court and prosecutors' records of case and defendant characteristics, probation files on offender supervision practices, and official records of rearrest, but do not include interviews with victims or offenders. This data collection has 20 data files containing 3,578 cases and 4,092 variables.  The data files contain information related to each site's Batterer Intervention Programs (Parts 1, 8, and 15), court data (Parts 2, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18), law enforcement (Parts 3, 11, and 17), and victim data (Parts 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 19).  The Dorchester, Massachusetts, and Washtenaw County, Michigan, Impact Evaluation Data (Part 7) include baseline and follow-up information for the offender and the victim.  The data file also contains Probation Supervision Performance Reports, Victim Services Logs, and Case Incident Fact Sheet information.  The Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Impact Evaluation Data (Part 20) include information related to the offender and the victim such as age, race, and sex, as well as arrest records including charges filed.",

-            "description": "In the mid-1980s New York City officials developed an intervention program, the Domestic Violence Intervention Education Project (DVIEP), to reduce repeat incidents of family abuse. The program posited that repeat victimization would decline as victims extracted themselves from self-defeating relationships or by working with social services and criminal justice staff to develop strategies to end the abuse while staying in the relationship. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the DVIEP model in reducing repeat instances of family violence. Between 1987 and 1997, three separate, randomized field experiments in New York City's public housing projects evaluated whether or not the DVIEP program reduced the rate of subsequent victimization. All three studies tested the same intervention model: persons who reported family violence to the police were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive a follow-up visit from a domestic violence prevention police officer and a social worker. For this study, researchers concatenated the micro data from the 3 experiments into a single, 1,037 case dataset that contains identical treatment and control measures, and nearly identical outcome measures. Of the 1,037 total cases in the study, 434 are from the 1987 Domestic Violence Study, 406 are from the Elder Abuse study, EFFECTIVENESS OF A JOINT POLICE AND SOCIAL SERVICES RESPONSE TO ELDER ABUSE IN MANHATTAN [NEW YORK CITY], NEW YORK, 1996-1997 (ICPSR 3130), and 197 are from the Domestic Violence Arrestee Study in Manhattan's Police Services Area 2 (PSA2). The resulting data collection contains a total of 31 variables including which study (1987 Domestic Violence Study, Elder Abuse Study, or Domestic Violence Arrestee Study) the respondent participated in, whether the respondent was part of the experimental group or the control group, whether the respondent received public education or a home visit by a DVIEP team, the number of DVIEP services the respondent used, and whether the respondent completed a final interview with a DVIEP team after six months of tracking. Additionally, variables include the victim's age, whether the perpetrator of domestic abuse was a romantic partner of the victim, the number of incidents reported to the police, the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) violence score, and the number of days until the first new incident of domestic abuse.",

More specifically, it was the task of this research project to evaluate the extant actuarials in a sample of sexual offenders on whom long-term follow-up data were available. Researchers attempted to assess the comparative accuracy of the major risk instruments over time and over subsamples, explore their underlying factor structure, examine the accuracy of a new assessment protocol, and explore the potential for generating improved predictive instruments. The sample was drawn from an earlier study in which researchers had followed 599 offenders who had been referred to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC) for evaluation between 1959 and 1984. Of these, 266 (the Bridgewater Treatment [BT] sample) had been committed to MTC as \"sexually dangerous\" and subsequently released, and 333 (the Bridgewater Observation [BO] sample) had been determined not to be sexually dangerous and returned to finish their sentences.  There were two sources of data for the study. The first source was the offender's MTC clinical and criminal archival records. The second comprised four record sources that were accessed to obtain comprehensive follow-up data.  In this study, researchers coded these records both on modern empirically-derived, mechanical actuarials that have been developed since 1997 for predicting sexual recidivism, and on a new experimental measure. Two coding teams were created. In general Team A was responsible for (a) purifying, redacting, and scanning detailed copies of offenders' files, (b) classifying all BO sample using both the MTC typologies and the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder categories, and (c) classifying a subset of the BT sample using the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder categories.  Team B was responsible for coding all actuarials and the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised on all offenders in the study, and for classifying all BT sample using the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder categories.",

It was designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency, adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the project also provided a detailed look at the environments in which these social behaviors take place by collecting substantial amounts of data about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and resources.\r\nPHDCN was directed from the Harvard School of Public Health, and funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, the National Institute of Mental Health, the U.S. Department of Education, and the Administration for Children, Youth and Families.\r\nThe project design consisted of two major components. The first was an intensive study of Chicago's neighborhoods, particularly the social, economic, organizational, political, and cultural structures and the dynamic changes that take place in the structures over time. The second component was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults over time to examine the changing circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics, that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial behaviors.\r\nFor more information about the PHDCN series, please visit NACJD's\u00a0PHDCN Resource Guide.\u00a0",

Four prior waves of data have been collected (2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006). Data were collected from adolescent respondents through structured in-home interviews utilizing laptop computers. In addition, the fifth wave, conducted in 2011 when the participants were young adults, builds on prior waves by adding quantitative and qualitative assessments of intimate partner violence (IPV).\r\nWave 1 and Wave 2 are available through DSDR and can be applied for together.

The intent was to accumulate a forensic skeletal\r\nsample large and diverse enough to reflect different socioeconomic\r\ngroups of the general population from different geographical regions\r\nof the country in order to enable researchers to revise the standards\r\nbeing used for forensic skeletal identification. The database is\r\ncomposed of eight data files, comprising four categories. The primary\r\n\"biographical\" or \"identification\" files (Part 1, Demographic\r\nData, and Part 2, Geographic and Death Data) comprise the first\r\ncategory of information and pertain to the positive identification of\r\neach of the 1,514 data records in the database. Information in Part 1\r\nincludes sex, ethnic group affiliation, birth date, age at death,\r\nheight (living and cadaver), and weight (living and\r\ncadaver). Variables in Part 2 pertain to the nature of the remains,\r\nmeans and sources of identification, city and state/country born,\r\noccupation, date missing/last seen, date of discovery, date of death,\r\ntime since death, cause of death, manner of death, deposit/exposure of\r\nbody, area found, city, county, and state/country found, handedness,\r\nand blood type. The Medical History File (Part 3) represents the\r\nsecond category of information and contains data on the documented\r\nmedical history of the individual. Variables in Part 3 include general\r\ncomments on medical history as well as comments on congenital\r\nmalformations, dental notes, bone lesions, perimortem trauma, and\r\nother comments. The third category consists of an inventory file (Part\r\n4, Skeletal Inventory Data) in which data pertaining to the specific\r\ncontents of the database are maintained. This includes the inventory\r\nof skeletal material by element and side (left and right), indicating\r\nthe condition of the bone as either partial or complete. The variables\r\nin Part 4 provide a skeletal inventory of the cranium, mandible,\r\ndentition, and postcranium elements and identify the element as\r\ncomplete, fragmentary, or absent. If absent, four categories record\r\nwhy it is missing. The last part of the database is composed of three\r\nskeletal data files, covering quantitative observations of age-related\r\nchanges in the skeleton (Part 5), cranial measurements (Part 6), and\r\npostcranial measurements (Part 7). Variables in Part 5 provide\r\nassessments of epiphyseal closure and cranial suture closure (left and\r\nright), rib end changes (left and right), Todd Pubic Symphysis,\r\nSuchey-Brooks Pubic Symphysis, McKern & Steward--Phases I, II, and\r\nIII, Gilbert & McKern--Phases I, II, and III, auricular surface, and\r\ndorsal pubic pitting (all for left and right). Variables in Part 6\r\ninclude cranial measurements (length, breadth, height) and mandibular\r\nmeasurements (height, thickness, diameter, breadth, length, and angle)\r\nof various skeletal elements. Part 7 provides postcranial measurements\r\n(length, diameter, breadth, circumference, and left and right, where\r\nappropriate) of the clavicle, scapula, humerus, radius, ulna, scarum,\r\ninnominate, femur, tibia, fibula, and calcaneus.

RCCC is a\r\ncounty jail for prisoners sentenced up to one year in custody. The\r\nOffice Technology Training program, one of several training programs\r\nfor inmates at RCCC, was designed to familiarize students with the use\r\nof computers in an office or business setting and to provide specific\r\ninstruction in several types of common office software, including word\r\nprocessing and desktop publishing. The purpose of the evaluation\r\nresearch was (1) to refine the process of determining what types of\r\ntraining should be funded and (2) to establish research-based\r\nevaluation protocols for local jail inmate training programs. Data\r\nwere collected on participants in the Office Technology Training\r\nclass, on a control group that matched the participants in terms of\r\ndemographic characteristics, and on a smaller group of nonparticipants\r\nwho had signed up for the training program but did not\r\nparticipate. Part 1, Treatment and Control Group Data, contains\r\nadministrative and survey data on both the trainees and the control\r\ngroup, while Part 2, Nonparticipant Data, includes administrative and\r\nsurvey data on the inmates who registered for the training but did not\r\nparticipate in the program. The survey consisted of an evaluation form\r\nfilled out by inmates who participated in the training at RCCC,\r\nindicating their prior experience with computers and software,\r\nevaluating the training they received, and assessing whether the new\r\nskills would be helpful in securing employment upon their\r\nrelease. Administrative records on all respondents (trainees, control,\r\nand nonparticipants) were collected from four sources: a supplemental\r\nform on inmates' employment, a probation report that provided personal\r\nand criminal histories, a risk assessment form, and a follow-up form\r\ncompleted by the probation officer within one week of the six-month\r\nanniversary of the inmate's release from RCCC. Variables from the\r\nsupplemental form included employment type and wages. The probation\r\nreport covered employment, education, military history, marital\r\nstatus, substance abuse, domestic violence, gang behavior, psychiatric\r\nhistory, child abuse history, and criminal histories as juveniles and\r\nadults. Data on attitude, alcohol and drug problems, number of felony\r\nconvictions, probation periods and violations, types of offenses, and\r\nhistory of institutionalization were taken from the risk assessment\r\nform. The follow-up form gathered information on release, disciplinary\r\nactions at RCCC, opinions about the Office Technology Training\r\nprogram, substance abuse, new arrests and convictions, gang behavior,\r\njob training, employment type, hourly wage, job satisfaction, and use\r\nof computers on the job. Additional administrative records data on\r\ntrainees and nonparticipants were gathered from the class registration\r\nform, including gender, education, birth date, ethnicity, language\r\nspoken, occupation, Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) scores, and\r\nclass assignments. Other data on trainees came from an evaluation\r\nform filled out by the students' instructor upon their completion of the\r\nOffice Technology class.

Survey data were obtained from students, teachers,\r\nand principals in each of the 44 junior and senior high schools in a\r\ncounty in Ohio that agreed to participate in the study. The data\r\nrepresent roughly a six-month time frame. Students in grades 7 through\r\n12 were anonymously surveyed in February 1994. The Student Survey (Part 1)\r\nwas randomly distributed to approximately half of the students in all\r\nclassrooms in each school. The other half of the students received a\r\ndifferent survey that focused on drug use among students (not\r\navailable with this collection). The teacher (Part 2) and principal\r\n(Part 3) surveys were completed at the same time as the student\r\nsurvey. The principal survey included both closed-ended and open-ended\r\nquestions, while all questions on the student and teacher surveys were\r\nclosed-ended, with a finite set of answers from which to choose. The\r\nthree questionnaires were designed to gather respondent demographics,\r\nperceptions about school discipline and control, information about\r\nweapons and gangs in the school, and perceptions about school crime,\r\nincluding personal victimization and responses to victimization. All\r\nthree surveys asked whether the school had a student court and, if so,\r\nwhat sanctions could be imposed by the student court for various forms\r\nof student misconduct. The student survey and teacher surveys also\r\nasked about the availability at school of various controlled\r\ndrugs. The student survey elicited information about the student's\r\nfear of crime in the school and on the way to and from school,\r\navoidance behaviors, and possession of weapons for protection. Data\r\nwere also obtained from the principals on each school's\r\nsuspension/expulsion rate, the number and type of security guards\r\nand/or devices used within the school, and other school safety\r\nmeasures. In addition to the surveys, census data were acquired for a\r\none-quarter-mile radius around each participating school's campus,\r\nproviding population demographics, educational attainment, employment\r\nstatus, marital status, income levels, and area housing\r\ninformation. Also, arrest statistics for six separate crimes (personal\r\ncrime, property crime, simple assault, disorderly conduct,\r\ndrug/alcohol offenses, and weapons offenses) for the reporting\r\ndistrict in which each school was located were obtained from local police\r\ndepartments. Finally, the quality of the immediate neighborhood was\r\nassessed by means of a \"windshield\" survey in which the researchers\r\nconducted a visual inventory of various neighborhood characteristics:\r\ntype and quality of housing in the area, types of businesses, presence\r\nof graffiti and gang graffiti, number of abandoned cars, and the\r\nnumber and perceived age of pedestrians and people loitering in the\r\narea.

To that end, the DTE program provided random, weekly drug\r\n tests to all clients in the program. These urinalysis tests allowed\r\n DTE to monitor each client's compliance with release conditions and\r\n progress in treatment programs, and to intervene appropriately when a\r\n client showed signs of a drug abuse problem.

This study was a program evaluation of two of DTE's\r\n divisions: the Pretrial Release Supervision Program (PRSP) and the\r\n probation and parole program. The pretrial division was chosen because\r\n it was the first opportunity for the criminal justice system to\r\n supervise and control the drug use of potential DTE clients. The\r\n probation and parole program was selected for three reasons: it was\r\n the largest component of the DTE program, it linked the pretrial and\r\n post-sentence DTE programs, and the experience of this program could\r\n be readily applied to the development of other such programs in other\r\n jurisdictions. The programs were evaluated using administrative data\r\n collected by corrections technicians, case managers, probation and\r\n parole officers, and the DTE central office. Part 1 (Pretrial Data)\r\n variables include dates of entry into and exit from the program,\r\n number of drug tests, number of positive tests for various drugs, type\r\n of offense and arrest date for each offense, and need assessment\r\n rating for medical, employment, legal, family, psychological, and drug\r\n addiction problems. Part 2 (Probation and Parole Data) variables\r\n include a probation or parole indicator, prior drug arrests, prior\r\n non-drug arrests, prior convictions, technical violations, drug use,\r\n and new drug crimes committed during the program.

The pretrial division was chosen because\r\n it was the first opportunity for the criminal justice system to\r\n supervise and control the drug use of potential DTE clients. The\r\n probation and parole program was selected for three reasons: it was\r\n the largest component of the DTE program, it linked the pretrial and\r\n post-sentence DTE programs, and the experience of this program could\r\n be readily applied to the development of other such programs in other\r\n jurisdictions. The programs were evaluated using administrative data\r\n collected by corrections technicians, case managers, probation and\r\n parole officers, and the DTE central office. Part 1 (Pretrial Data)\r\n variables include dates of entry into and exit from the program,\r\n number of drug tests, number of positive tests for various drugs, type\r\n of offense and arrest date for each offense, and need assessment\r\n rating for medical, employment, legal, family, psychological, and drug\r\n addiction problems. Part 2 (Probation and Parole Data) variables\r\n include a probation or parole indicator, prior drug arrests, prior\r\n non-drug arrests, prior convictions, technical violations, drug use,\r\n and new drug crimes committed during the program. Demographic\r\nvariables for both files include age, race, and gender.",

In Part 1, the\r\nresearchers conducted a national survey of 750 law enforcement\r\nspecialists and prosecutors to get a general overview of Soviet emigre\r\ncrime in the United States. For Parts 2-14, the researchers wanted to\r\nlook particularly at the character, operations, and structure, as well\r\nas the criminal ventures and enterprises, of Soviet emigre crime\r\nnetworks in the New York-New Jersey-Pennsylvania region. They were\r\nalso interested in any international criminal connections to these\r\nnetworks, especially with the former Soviet Union. The investigators\r\nfocused particularly on identifying whether these particular networks\r\nmet the following criteria commonly used to define organized crime:\r\n(1) some degree of hierarchical structure within the network, (2)\r\ncontinuity of that structure over time, (3) use of corruption and\r\nviolence to facilitate and protect criminal activities, (4) internal\r\ndiscipline within the network structure, (5) involvement in multiple\r\ncriminal enterprises that are carried out with a degree of criminal\r\nsophistication, (6) involvement in legitimate businesses, and (7)\r\nbonding among participants based upon shared ethnicity.

-            "description": "This study's purpose was twofold: to investigate the nature\r\n of police patrol work in a community policing context and to\r\n field-test data collection instruments designed for systematic social\r\n observation. The project, conducted in Richmond, Virginia, where its\r\n police department was in the third year of a five-year plan to\r\n implement community policing, was designed as a case study of one\r\n police department's experience with community policing, focusing on\r\n officers in the patrol division. A team of eight researchers conducted\r\n observations with the police officers in the spring and summer of\r\n 1992. A total of 120 officers were observed during 125 observation\r\n sessions. Observers accompanied officers throughout their regular work\r\n shifts, taking brief field notes on officers' activities and\r\n encounters with the public. All of an observed officer's time during\r\n the shift was accounted for by either encounters or activities. Within\r\n 15 hours of the completion of the ridealong, the observer prepared a\r\n detailed narrative account of events that occurred during the\r\n ridealong and coded key items associated with these events. The study\r\n generated five nested quantitative datasets that can be linked by\r\n common variables. Part 1, Ridealong Data, provides information\r\n pertinent to the 125 observation sessions or \"rides.\" Part 2, Activity\r\n Data, focuses on 5,576 activities conducted by officers when not\r\n engaged in encounters. Data in Part 3, Encounter Data, describe 1,098\r\n encounters with citizens during the ridealongs. An encounter was\r\n defined as a communication between officers and citizens that took\r\n over one minute, involved more than three verbal exchanges between an\r\n officer and a citizen, or involved significant physical contact\r\n between the officer and citizen. Part 4, Citizen Data, provides data\r\n relevant to each of the 1,630 citizens engaged by police in the\r\n encounters. Some encounters involved more than one citizen. Part 5,\r\n Arrest Data, was constructed by merging Parts 1, 3, and 4, and\r\n provides information on 451 encounters that occurred during the\r\n ridealongs in which the citizen was suspected of some criminal\r\n mischief. All identification variables in this collection were created\r\n by the researchers for this project. Variables from Part 1 include\r\n date, start time, end time, unit, and beat assignment of the\r\n observation session, and the primary officer's and secondary officer's\r\n sex, race/ethnicity, years as an officer, months assigned to precinct\r\n and beat, hours of community policing training, and general\r\n orientation to community policing. Variables in Part 2 specify the\r\n time the activity began and ended, who initiated the activity, type,\r\n location, and visibility of the activity, involvement of the officer's\r\n supervisor during the activity, and if the activity involved\r\n problem-solving, or meeting with citizens or other community\r\n organizations. Part 3 variables include time encounter began and\r\n ended, who initiated the encounter, primary and secondary officer's\r\n energy level and mood before the encounter, problem as radioed by\r\n dispatcher, and problem as it appeared at the beginning of the\r\n encounter and at the end of the encounter. Information on the location\r\n of the encounter includes percent of time at initial location,\r\n visibility, officer's prior knowledge of the initial location, and if\r\n the officer anticipated violence at the scene. Additional variables\r\n focus on the presence of a supervisor, other police officers, service\r\n personnel, bystanders, and participants, if the officer filed or\r\n intended to file a report, if the officer engaged in problem-solving,\r\n and factors that influenced the officer's actions. Citizen information\r\n in Part 4 includes sex, age, and race/ethnicity of the citizen, role\r\n in the encounter, if the citizen appeared to be of low income, under\r\n the use of alcohol or drugs, or appeared to have a mental disorder or\r\n physical injury or illness, if the citizen was representing an\r\n establishment, if the citizen lived, worked, or owned property in the\r\n police beat, and if the citizen had a weapon. Also presented are\r\n various aspects of the police-citizen interaction, such as evidence\r\n considered by the officer, requests and responses to each other, and\r\n changes in actions during the encounter. Variables in Part 5 record\r\n the officer's orientation toward community policing, if the suspect\r\n was arrested or cited, if the offense was serious or drug-related,\r\n amount of evidence, if the victim requested that the suspect be\r\n arrested, if the victim was white, Black, and of low income, and if\r\n the suspect represented an organization. Information on the suspect\r\n includes gender, race, sobriety level, if of low income, if 19 years\r\n old or less, if actively resistant, if the officer knew the suspect\r\n adversarially, and if the suspect demonstrated conflict with\r\n others. Some items were recoded for the particular analyses for which\r\nthe Arrest Data were constructed.",

Within\r\n 15 hours of the completion of the ridealong, the observer prepared a\r\n detailed narrative account of events that occurred during the\r\n ridealong and coded key items associated with these events. The study\r\n generated five nested quantitative datasets that can be linked by\r\n common variables. Part 1, Ridealong Data, provides information\r\n pertinent to the 125 observation sessions or \"rides.\" Part 2, Activity\r\n Data, focuses on 5,576 activities conducted by officers when not\r\n engaged in encounters. Data in Part 3, Encounter Data, describe 1,098\r\n encounters with citizens during the ridealongs. An encounter was\r\n defined as a communication between officers and citizens that took\r\n over one minute, involved more than three verbal exchanges between an\r\n officer and a citizen, or involved significant physical contact\r\n between the officer and citizen. Part 4, Citizen Data, provides data\r\n relevant to each of the 1,630 citizens engaged by police in the\r\n encounters. Some encounters involved more than one citizen. Part 5,\r\n Arrest Data, was constructed by merging Parts 1, 3, and 4, and\r\n provides information on 451 encounters that occurred during the\r\n ridealongs in which the citizen was suspected of some criminal\r\n mischief. All identification variables in this collection were created\r\n by the researchers for this project. Variables from Part 1 include\r\n date, start time, end time, unit, and beat assignment of the\r\n observation session, and the primary officer's and secondary officer's\r\n sex, race/ethnicity, years as an officer, months assigned to precinct\r\n and beat, hours of community policing training, and general\r\n orientation to community policing. Variables in Part 2 specify the\r\n time the activity began and ended, who initiated the activity, type,\r\n location, and visibility of the activity, involvement of the officer's\r\n supervisor during the activity, and if the activity involved\r\n problem-solving, or meeting with citizens or other community\r\n organizations. Part 3 variables include time encounter began and\r\n ended, who initiated the encounter, primary and secondary officer's\r\n energy level and mood before the encounter, problem as radioed by\r\n dispatcher, and problem as it appeared at the beginning of the\r\n encounter and at the end of the encounter. Information on the location\r\n of the encounter includes percent of time at initial location,\r\n visibility, officer's prior knowledge of the initial location, and if\r\n the officer anticipated violence at the scene. Additional variables\r\n focus on the presence of a supervisor, other police officers, service\r\n personnel, bystanders, and participants, if the officer filed or\r\n intended to file a report, if the officer engaged in problem-solving,\r\n and factors that influenced the officer's actions. Citizen information\r\n in Part 4 includes sex, age, and race/ethnicity of the citizen, role\r\n in the encounter, if the citizen appeared to be of low income, under\r\n the use of alcohol or drugs, or appeared to have a mental disorder or\r\n physical injury or illness, if the citizen was representing an\r\n establishment, if the citizen lived, worked, or owned property in the\r\n police beat, and if the citizen had a weapon. Also presented are\r\n various aspects of the police-citizen interaction, such as evidence\r\n considered by the officer, requests and responses to each other, and\r\n changes in actions during the encounter. Variables in Part 5 record\r\n the officer's orientation toward community policing, if the suspect\r\n was arrested or cited, if the offense was serious or drug-related,\r\n amount of evidence, if the victim requested that the suspect be\r\n arrested, if the victim was white, Black, and of low income, and if\r\n the suspect represented an organization. Information on the suspect\r\n includes gender, race, sobriety level, if of low income, if 19 years\r\n old or less, if actively resistant, if the officer knew the suspect\r\n adversarially, and if the suspect demonstrated conflict with\r\n others. Some items were recoded for the particular analyses for which\r\nthe Arrest Data were constructed.",

The project assessed the role that gangs play in the lives\r\n of youth whose living conditions are otherwise comparable. In order to\r\n study the criminal behavior of gangs, investigators sought to\r\n interview 50 gang members and 50 non-gang, at-risk youth at two sites\r\n in Colorado and one site in Florida. A large portion of the interview\r\n questions asked in both the gang member interview and the at-risk\r\n youth interview were parallel. The following variables appear in both\r\n the gang member and at-risk youth files (Parts 1 and 2 respectively)\r\n created for this data collection: gang popularity variables\r\n (respondents' perceptions of the positive and negative attributes of a\r\n gang, and why gangs endure over time), drug involvement variables\r\n (whether respondents or fellow members/friends sold various types of\r\n drugs, why selling drugs increases a person's \"juice\", the drug source\r\n organization, and where they traveled to get the drugs), criminal\r\n history variables (the reasons why respondents believed they were able\r\n to get away with crimes, their first arrest age, and their most\r\n serious arrest charge), personal activity variables (whether\r\n respondents or fellow members/friends participated in dances, sporting\r\n events, fighting, drug use or selling, shoplifting, assaulting people,\r\n or burglarizing homes), variables concerning the future (whether\r\n respondents would join a gang again/join a gang today, why some gangs\r\n survive and others don't, and how respondents see their future), and\r\n demographic variables (respondents' age, sex, race, city,\r\n neighborhood, school, school status, type of work, marital status, and\r\n relationship with parent(s)). In addition, Part 1, the Gang Member\r\n Data, contains gang status variables (gang symbols, gang nickname,\r\n gang turf, and how members define a gang) and gang membership\r\n variables (roles of the respondents within the gang, why members join\r\n a gang, what the most important gang rule is, and what happens to\r\n those who refuse the gang). Part 2, At-Risk Youth Data, contains\r\n additional variables on gang contact (the names of gangs who had\r\n approached the respondents, methods used to try to get the youths to\r\n join, how the youths refused the gang, and what happened as a result\r\n of refusing) and prevention (how at-risk youth would advise a young\r\n person to react if approached by a gang, and what the youths felt was\r\nthe best way to prepare children to deal with gangs).",

This study was undertaken to examine and evaluate the\r\neffects and outcomes of Project ROAR as it was implemented in the\r\nParsons' Public Housing Complex, located in downtown Spokane,\r\nWashington. In addition, the study sought to determine to what extent\r\nthe project as implemented reflected Project ROAR as originally\r\nconceived, and whether Project ROAR could be considered a\r\ncomprehensive community policing crime prevention program. Further,\r\nthe study attempted to determine what effects this collaborative\r\nanti-crime program might have on: (1) residents' perceptions of the\r\nquality of their neighborhood life, including perceptions of\r\nneighborhood inhabitants, satisfaction with their neighborhood, fear\r\nof crime, and neighborhood physical and social disorder, (2) objective\r\nmeasures of physical and social disorder, (3) levels of neighborhood\r\ncrime, and (4) subjective perceptions of the level and quality of\r\npolicing services. To assess the implementation and short-term impacts\r\nof Project ROAR, data were collected from various sources. First, four\r\nwaves of face-to-face interviews were conducted with Parsons' Public\r\nHousing residents at approximately six-month intervals: April 1994,\r\nDecember 1994, May 1995, and November 1995 (Part 1, Public Housing\r\nResidents Survey Data). Information collected from interviews with the\r\nParsons' residents focused on their involvement with Project ROAR,\r\ncommunity block watches, and tenant councils. Residents commented on\r\nwhether there had been any changes in the level of police presence,\r\ndrug-related crimes, prostitution, or any other physical or social\r\nchanges in their neighborhood since the inception of Project\r\nROAR. Residents were asked to rate their satisfaction with the housing\r\ncomplex, the neighborhood, the Spokane Police Department, the number\r\nof police present in the neighborhood, and the level of police\r\nservice. Residents were also asked if they had been the victim of any\r\ncrimes and to rate their level of fear of crime in the complex during\r\nthe day and night, pre- and post-Project ROAR. The gender and age of\r\neach survey participant was also recorded. The second source of data\r\nwas a city-wide survey mailed to the residents of Spokane (Part 2,\r\nSpokane Citizens Survey Data). Information collected from the survey\r\nincludes demographics on ethnicity, gender, age, highest level of\r\neducation, present occupation, and family income. The city residents\r\nwere also asked to assess the level of police service, the number of\r\npolice present in their neighborhood, the helpfulness of neighbors,\r\nwhether they felt safe alone in their neighborhood, and overall\r\nsatisfaction with their neighborhood. Third, a block-level physical\r\nand social disorder inventory was taken in April 1994, October 1994,\r\nApril 1994, and October 1995 (Part 3, Neighborhood Inventory\r\nData). The sex, age, and behavior of the first ten people observed\r\nduring the inventory period were recorded, as well as the number of\r\npeople observed loitering. Other observations made included the number\r\nof panhandlers, prostitutes, open drug sales, and displays of public\r\ndrunkenness. The number of residential and commercial properties,\r\nrestaurants, bars, office buildings, empty lots, unboarded and boarded\r\nabandoned buildings, potholes, barriers (walls or fences), abandoned\r\ncars, and for-sale signs, along with the amount of graffiti on public\r\nand private properties and the amount of litter and broken glass\r\nobserved in each neighborhood, completed the inventory data. Finally,\r\ncrime reports were collected from the Spokane Police Department's\r\nCrime Analysis Unit (Part 4, Disaggregated Crime Data, and Part 5,\r\nAggregated Crime Data). These data contain monthly counts of robberies\r\nand burglaries for the public housing neighborhood, a constructed\r\ncontrolled comparison neighborhood, and the city of Spokane for the\r\nperiod January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995.",

-            "description": "This study was undertaken to address Iowa's inability to\r\nclassify juveniles at risk of recidivism uniformly across the state by\r\ncreating and testing a proposed risk assessment instrument. It was\r\nanticipated that the risk assessment instrument would be useful in not\r\nonly providing the juvenile court officers with a tool to\r\nappropriately assess the risk of recidivism, but also in providing\r\n\"common ground\" to treatment staff and other relevant officials to\r\ndetermine whether certain interventions worked better with certain\r\nlevels of risk than others, and whether limited resources were being\r\nappropriately utilized in providing appropriate interventions to\r\njuveniles with specific risk scores. To develop the Proposed Iowa\r\nJuvenile Court Intake Risk Assessment, a team of juvenile court\r\nrepresentatives from all eight judicial districts in Iowa, consisting\r\nof juvenile court officers, intake officers, and supervisors, designed\r\na risk assessment test instrument to assess a group of juveniles at\r\nintake during a one-month period between October and November\r\n1994. The follow-up data collection was conducted by chief juvenile\r\ncourt officers eight months after the original data collection. The\r\npurpose of the follow-up was to gather data regarding\r\nreoffending. Risk assessment variables include types and number of\r\ncurrent offenses, prior arrests and adjudication, histories of\r\nsupervision and service, substance use and abuse, runaway occurrences,\r\npeer relationships, gang affiliation, attitude during intake\r\ninterview, level of parental control, schooling status (dropped out,\r\ngraduated, truant), type of current school, discipline problems,\r\nsuspensions at school, current employment, history of family problems,\r\nand reoffending. Demographic variables include offender's sex and\r\nrace.",

It was\r\nanticipated that the risk assessment instrument would be useful in not\r\nonly providing the juvenile court officers with a tool to\r\nappropriately assess the risk of recidivism, but also in providing\r\n\"common ground\" to treatment staff and other relevant officials to\r\ndetermine whether certain interventions worked better with certain\r\nlevels of risk than others, and whether limited resources were being\r\nappropriately utilized in providing appropriate interventions to\r\njuveniles with specific risk scores. To develop the Proposed Iowa\r\nJuvenile Court Intake Risk Assessment, a team of juvenile court\r\nrepresentatives from all eight judicial districts in Iowa, consisting\r\nof juvenile court officers, intake officers, and supervisors, designed\r\na risk assessment test instrument to assess a group of juveniles at\r\nintake during a one-month period between October and November\r\n1994. The follow-up data collection was conducted by chief juvenile\r\ncourt officers eight months after the original data collection. The\r\npurpose of the follow-up was to gather data regarding\r\nreoffending. Risk assessment variables include types and number of\r\ncurrent offenses, prior arrests and adjudication, histories of\r\nsupervision and service, substance use and abuse, runaway occurrences,\r\npeer relationships, gang affiliation, attitude during intake\r\ninterview, level of parental control, schooling status (dropped out,\r\ngraduated, truant), type of current school, discipline problems,\r\nsuspensions at school, current employment, history of family problems,\r\nand reoffending. Demographic variables include offender's sex and\r\nrace.",

The\r\nstudy focuses on four major topics: (1) release--rates and types of\r\nreleases, defendant or case characteristics and their impact on the\r\nrelease decision, (2) court appearance --extent to which released\r\ndefendants appear in court, factors associated with defendants'\r\nfailure to appear in court, (3) pretrial criminality--number of\r\nrearrests during the pretrial period and the factors predicting\r\nrearrest, charges and rates of conviction for crimes committed during\r\nthe pretrial period, and (4) impact of pretrial release programs--effect of\r\nprograms on release decisions and on the behavior of defendants. The study\r\nis limited to adult defendants processed through state and local trial\r\ncourts, and to pretrial release rather than pretrial intervention or\r\ndiversion programs. Part 1 is an analysis of release practices and\r\noutcomes in eight jurisdictions (Baltimore City and Baltimore County,\r\nMaryland, Washington, DC, Dade County, Florida, Jefferson County,\r\nKentucky, Pima County, Arizona, Santa Cruz County, California, and\r\nSanta Clara County, California). The pretrial release \"delivery\r\nsystems,\" that is, the major steps and individuals and organizations\r\nin the pretrial release process, were analyzed in each jurisdiction.\r\nAdditionally, a sample of defendants from each site was studied from\r\npoint of arrest to final case disposition and sentencing. Part 2 of\r\nthis study examines the impact of the existence of pretrial release\r\nprograms on release, court appearance, and pretrial release outcomes.\r\nAn experimental design was used to compare a group of\r\ndefendants who participated in a pretrial release program with a\r\ncontrol group who did not. Experiments were conducted in Pima County\r\n(Tucson), Arizona, Baltimore City, Maryland, Lincoln, Nebraska, and\r\nJefferson County (Beaumont-Port Arthur), Texas. In Tucson, separate\r\nexperiments were conducted for felony and misdemeanor cases.",

+            "description": "Funded by the National Institute of Justice, this data collection\r\nrepresents Phase II of a larger project to evaluate pretrial release\r\npractices. The\r\nstudy focuses on four major topics: (1) release--rates and types of\r\nreleases, defendant or case characteristics and their impact on the\r\nrelease decision, (2) court appearance --extent to which released\r\ndefendants appear in court, factors associated with defendants'\r\nfailure to appear in court, (3) pretrial criminality--number of\r\nrearrests during the pretrial period and the factors predicting\r\nrearrest, charges and rates of conviction for crimes committed during\r\nthe pretrial period, and (4) impact of pretrial release programs--effect of\r\nprograms on release decisions and on the behavior of defendants. The study\r\nis limited to adult defendants processed through state and local trial\r\ncourts, and to pretrial release rather than pretrial intervention or\r\ndiversion programs. Part 1 is an analysis of release practices and\r\noutcomes in eight jurisdictions (Baltimore City and Baltimore County,\r\nMaryland, Washington, DC, Dade County, Florida, Jefferson County,\r\nKentucky, Pima County, Arizona, Santa Cruz County, California, and\r\nSanta Clara County, California). The pretrial release \"delivery\r\nsystems,\" that is, the major steps and individuals and organizations\r\nin the pretrial release process, were analyzed in each jurisdiction.\r\nAdditionally, a sample of defendants from each site was studied from\r\npoint of arrest to final case disposition and sentencing. Part 2 of\r\nthis study examines the impact of the existence of pretrial release\r\nprograms on release, court appearance, and pretrial release outcomes.\r\nAn experimental design was used to compare a group of\r\ndefendants who participated in a pretrial release program with a\r\ncontrol group who did not. Experiments were conducted in Pima County\r\n(Tucson), Arizona, Baltimore City, Maryland, Lincoln, Nebraska, and\r\nJefferson County (Beaumont-Port Arthur), Texas. In Tucson, separate\r\nexperiments were conducted for felony and misdemeanor cases.",

These projects were the Reactions to Crime (RTC)\r\nProject, which was supported by the United States Department of\r\nJustice's National Institute of Justice as part of its Research\r\nAgreements Program, and the Rape Project, supported by the National\r\nCenter for the Prevention and Control of Rape, a subdivision of the\r\nNational Institute of Mental Health. Both investigations were\r\nconcerned with individual behavior and collective reactions to\r\ncrime. The Rape Project was specifically concerned with sexual assault\r\nand its consequences for the lives of women. The three cities selected\r\nfor study were Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. A total of\r\nten neighborhoods were chosen from these cities along a number of\r\ndimensions -- ethnicity, class, crime, and levels of organizational\r\nactivity. In addition, a small city-wide sample was drawn from each\r\ncity. Reactions to crime topics covered how individuals band together\r\nto deal with crime problems, individual responses to crime such as\r\nproperty marking or the installation of locks and bars, and the impact\r\nof fear of crime on day-to-day behavior -- for example, shopping and\r\nrecreational patterns. Respondents were asked several questions that\r\ncalled for self-reports of behavior, including events and conditions\r\nin their home areas, their relationship to their neighbors, who they\r\nknew and visited around their homes, and what they watched on TV and\r\nread in the newspapers. Also included were a number of questions\r\nmeasuring respondents' perceptions of the extent of crime in their\r\ncommunities, whether they knew someone who had been a victim, and what\r\nthey had done to reduce their own chances of being victimized.\r\nQuestions on sexual assault/rape included whether the respondent\r\nthought this was a neighborhood problem, if the number of rapes in the\r\nneighborhood were increasing or decreasing, how many women they\r\nthought had been sexually assaulted or raped in the neighborhood in\r\nthe previous year, and how they felt about various rape prevention\r\nmeasures, such as increasing home security, women not going out alone\r\nat night, women dressing more modestly, learning self-defense\r\ntechniques, carrying weapons, increasing men's respect of women, and\r\nnewspapers publishing the names of known rapists. Female respondents\r\nwere asked whether they thought it likely that they would be sexually\r\nassaulted in the next year, how much they feared sexual assault when\r\ngoing out alone after dark in the neighborhood, whether they knew a\r\nsexual assault victim, whether they had reported any sexual assaults\r\nto police, and where and when sexual assaults took place that they\r\nwere aware of.

The\r\n data were gathered for part or all of 270 shifts through observations\r\n by researchers riding in police cars in two Chicago police districts\r\n during a 14-month period in 1980-1981. In Part 1 (Shift Level),\r\n information was collected once per shift on the general level of\r\n activity during the shift and the observer's perceptions of\r\n emotions/attitudes displayed by the police officers he/she\r\n observed. The file also contains, for each of the 270 shifts,\r\n information about the personal characteristics, work history, and\r\n working relationships of the police officers observed. Part 2\r\n (Encounter Level) contains detailed information on each police-citizen\r\n encounter including its nature, location, police actions and/or\r\n responses, citizens involved, and their characteristics and\r\n behavior. A unique and consistent shift identification number is\r\n attached to each encounter so that information about police officer\r\n characteristics from Part 1 may be matched with Part 2. There are\r\n 1,382 police-citizen encounters involving 2,555 citizens in this\r\ncollection.",

Citizens' attitudes toward the police were also\r\n examined. Baseline data were collected to determine residents'\r\n perceptions of crime, victimization experiences, crime-avoidance\r\n behavior, and level of satisfaction with the quality of life in their\r\n neighborhoods (Parts 1 and 3). Follow-up surveys were conducted to\r\n evaluate the effectiveness of experimental police programs designed to\r\n reduce the fear of crime within the communities. These results are\r\n presented in Parts 2 and 4. In Part 5, questions similar to those in\r\n the baseline survey were posed to two groups of victims who reported\r\n crimes to the police. One group had received a follow-up call to\r\n provide the victim with information, assistance, and reassurance that\r\n someone cared, and the other was a control group of victims that had\r\n not received a follow-up call. Part 6 contains data from a newsletter\r\n experiment conducted by the police departments after the baseline data\r\n were gathered, in one area each of Houston and Newark. Two versions of\r\n an anti-crime newsletter were mailed to respondents to the baseline\r\n survey and also to nonrespondents living in the area. These groups\r\n were then interviewed, along with control groups of baseline\r\n respondents and nonrespondents who might have seen the newsletter but\r\n were not selected for the mailing. Demographic data collected include\r\nage, sex, race, education and employment.",

Citizens' attitudes toward the police were also\r\n examined. Baseline data were collected to determine residents'\r\n perceptions of crime, victimization experiences, crime-avoidance\r\n behavior, and level of satisfaction with the quality of life in their\r\n neighborhoods (Parts 1 and 3). Follow-up surveys were conducted to\r\n evaluate the effectiveness of experimental police programs designed to\r\n reduce the fear of crime within the communities. These results are\r\n presented in Parts 2 and 4. In Part 5, questions similar to those in\r\n the baseline survey were posed to two groups of victims who reported\r\n crimes to the police. One group had received a follow-up call to\r\n provide the victim with information, assistance, and reassurance that\r\n someone cared, and the other was a control group of victims that had\r\n not received a follow-up call. Part 6 contains data from a newsletter\r\n experiment conducted by the police departments after the baseline data\r\n were gathered, in one area each of Houston and Newark. Two versions of\r\n an anti-crime newsletter were mailed to respondents to the baseline\r\n survey and also to nonrespondents living in the area. These groups\r\n were then interviewed, along with control groups of baseline\r\n respondents and nonrespondents who might have seen the newsletter but\r\n were not selected for the mailing. Demographic data collected include\r\nage, sex, race, education and employment.",

Synthetic drugs\r\n investigated in the collection include PCP, ice, ecstasy, and speed,\r\n while nonsynthetic drugs include alcohol, marijuana, heroin, cocaine,\r\n and crack. Patterns of use for all of these drugs are explored.\r\n Questions about specific drugs include whether the respondent had ever\r\n used the drug, age first used, number of days in the past 30 days the\r\n drug was used, whether the drug was used more than two times per week,\r\n method of drug intake, and the drug used most often by the respondent\r\n and by the respondent's friends. Additional variables include reasons\r\n for preferring synthetic or nonsynthetic drugs, reasons the respondent\r\n would discontinue use or switch to another drug, availability and cost\r\n of certain drugs, and extent of involvement in selling, money handling,\r\n and protection. Finally, demographic variables such as sex, ethnicity,\r\n age, highest grade completed, employment activity in the past month,\r\n geographical location, and subject source (criminal justice system or\r\n drug treatment center) are included in the file. The unit of analysis\r\nis the individual drug user.",
