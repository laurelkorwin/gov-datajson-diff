The waiver laws were enacted to ensure that a youth who was\r\n unwilling to comply with treatment and/or committed a serious offense\r\n would have a serious consequence to his/her action and, therefore,\r\n would be processed in the adult system. As a result of the\r\n legislation, four pathways of court processing emerged which created\r\n four groups of youths to study: at-risk of waiver (not waived),\r\n waiver, legislative waiver, and reverse waver. A variety of data\r\n sources in both the juvenile and adult systems were triangulated to\r\n obtain the necessary information to accurately describe the youths\r\n involved. The triangulation of data from multiple file sources\r\n happened in a variety of formats (automated, hardcopy, and electronic\r\n files) from a variety of agencies to compare and contrast youths\r\n processed in the juvenile and adult systems. The five legislative\r\n criteria (age, mental and physical condition, amenability to\r\n treatment, crime seriousness, and public safety) plus extra-legal data\r\n were used as a framework to profile the youths in this study. Many of\r\n the variables chosen to explore each domain were included in previous\r\n studies. Other variables, such as those designed to operationalize\r\n mental health issues (not defined by the legislation) were chosen to\r\n extend the literature and to generate the most complete profile of\r\n youths processed in each system. The study includes variables\r\n pertinent to the five legislative criteria in addition to demographic\r\n and family information variables such as gender, race, and\r\n socioeconomic status, information on school expulsions, school\r\n suspensions, gang involvement, drug history, health, and\r\nhospitalization.",

It sought to develop and assess instruments and generate data to serve as guideposts for policy and service delivery.  The study consisted of two parts: (1) a series of interviews with 40 female welfare recipients, and (2) a community literacy project that resulted in a collection of narratives by female welfare recipients.\r\nInterviews were conducted with 40 Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) recipients who were enrolled at the Reemployment Transition Center (RTC) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, between May 29, 2001, and June 27, 2001.\r\nAfter explaining the research project to the intake group, the interviewers met in private with interested potential subjects. The interviews consisted of an initial face-to-face retrospective interview (Parts 1 through 5), conducted when subjects enrolled at RTC, and three follow-up interviews designed to be administered quarterly.\r\nThe first follow-up interview (Part 6) was conducted between October 15, 2001, and May 7, 2002. The second follow-up interview (Part 7) was conducted between March 12, 2002, and May 21, 2002. The final follow-up (Part 8) interview was conducted between July 3, 2002, and November 15, 2002.\r\nFollow-up interviews were in person or by telephone (depending on the respondent's preference).\r\nA key innovation of this research project was to gather data on school, work, welfare, and relationships with enough precision to trace the complex connections among battering, work, and welfare over the course of poor women's lives (Part 9). To do so, researchers collected data on the start and end dates of each period of education, each job, each period on welfare, and each relationship. These data enabled researchers to compare the number and length of spells at work and on welfare for women who did and women who did not report various obstacles, including battering.\r\nFinally, researchers summarized some elements of the longitudinal data such as relationship and employment information into a data file (Part 10). In all, there are 10 quantitative data files encompassing 1,895 variables.\r\nIn addition to the 10 quantitative data files, there are respondent answers to open text questions (Part 11).  Interviewers were able to record field notes, which included observations about the interview context, overall impressions of the process, elaborated answers to open-ended questions, etc. (Part 12).  There are also 8 autobiographical narratives to serve as sources of qualitative data on the ways current and former welfare recipients experience and perceive work, welfare, and relationships (including abuse) (Part 13).\r\nThe Part 1 (Retrospective Demographic and Hardship Data) data file contains demographic information including living arrangements and income. The Part 2 (Retrospective Education Data) data file contains information related to the respondent's prior education. The Part 3 (Retrospective Employment Data) data file contains information related to the respondent's employment history. The Part 4 (Retrospective Welfare Data) contains information related to the respondent's welfare history. The Part 5 (Retrospective Relationship Data) data file contains information related to the Work-Related Control, Abuse, and Sabotage Checklist (WORCASC) and the Work/School Abuse Scale (W/SAS), which asked questions about interference, sabotage, and violence in relationships.\r\nThe Part 6 (First Follow-Up Interview Data), Part 7 (Second Follow-Up Interview Data), and Part 8 (Final Follow-Up Interview Data) data files include follow-up information to that collected in Parts 1-5. The Part 9 (Date and Spell Data) data file provides data on the start and end dates of each period of education, each job, each period on welfare, and each relationship, and the Part 10 (Summary Longitudinal Data) data file summarizes some elements of the longitudinal data.",

The SSO was a standardized approach for directly observing the\r\n physical, social, and economic characteristics of neighborhoods, one\r\n block at a time. In 1995, the PHDCN initiated a combined person-based\r\n and videotaped approach to collecting systematic observations of\r\n neighborhoods. Eighty of the 343 Neighborhood Clusters were used in\r\n this study. Once the sampling was complete, the block face (the block\r\n segment on one side of the street) became the unit of observation.\r\n Using videotape and observer logs, data were collected in the 80\r\n sampled Chicago neighborhoods. Only a sample of block faces were\r\n selected for coding due to budget expenses. The National Opinion\r\n Research Center (NORC) collected the data for the SSO. Between June\r\n and October of 1995, trained observers from NORC drove a sports\r\n utility vehicle down every block within the 80 sampled neighborhoods.\r\n A videographer videotaped both sides of each block, while two\r\n observers recorded characteristics of each block face on observer\r\n logs. Further coding of the videotapes and observer logs was conducted\r\nby NORC staff.",

The primary objective was to examine the relationships\r\n among these factors: supervision costs, the collection of court costs,\r\n fines, and restitution, types of supervision, risk assessment, and\r\n probationer conduct for the population of probationers. Probationers\r\n were initially classified according to risk assessment and then\r\n randomly assigned to a supervision category. The probationer's risk\r\n potential was a numerical score derived from demographic background\r\n variables, prior record, and history of substance use. The DSCP\r\n (Degree of Successful Completion of Probation) was developed\r\n specifically to measure probationer conduct and to compare trends and\r\n relationships.  The variables examined in the study include: risk\r\n assessment at intake, supervision level assigned, number of times the\r\n probationer was assigned to probation, start and planned termination\r\n dates, date of last status change, status at termination, degree of\r\n successful completion of probation achieved, costs incurred in\r\n administering probation, and amounts collected from each probationer\r\n for court costs, restitution, and fines. Although data were collected\r\n on 7,072 misdemeanant probation experiences, there are only 2,756\r\n probationers included in the study. The remaining 4,316 cases were\r\n excluded due to failure of the probationer to show up for screening or\r\nfor other reasons that did not meet the research criteria.",

The primary objective was to examine the relationships\r\n among these factors: supervision costs, the collection of court costs,\r\n fines, and restitution, types of supervision, risk assessment, and\r\n probationer conduct for the population of probationers. Probationers\r\n were initially classified according to risk assessment and then\r\n randomly assigned to a supervision category. The probationer's risk\r\n potential was a numerical score derived from demographic background\r\n variables, prior record, and history of substance use. The DSCP\r\n (Degree of Successful Completion of Probation) was developed\r\n specifically to measure probationer conduct and to compare trends and\r\n relationships.  The variables examined in the study include: risk\r\n assessment at intake, supervision level assigned, number of times the\r\n probationer was assigned to probation, start and planned termination\r\n dates, date of last status change, status at termination, degree of\r\n successful completion of probation achieved, costs incurred in\r\n administering probation, and amounts collected from each probationer\r\n for court costs, restitution, and fines. Although data were collected\r\n on 7,072 misdemeanant probation experiences, there are only 2,756\r\n probationers included in the study. The remaining 4,316 cases were\r\n excluded due to failure of the probationer to show up for screening or\r\nfor other reasons that did not meet the research criteria.",

Specifically, the study assesses the impact of a\r\n \"practice interview\" about an event on the completeness and accuracy\r\n of later reports about a second, unrelated event. Three interview\r\n conditions were employed, and each condition consisted of both a\r\n practice interview and a target interview. The three conditions were\r\n RS, RC, and CC, where \"R\" represents a practice session with\r\n rapport-building only, \"S\" represents a target interview that\r\n contained all components of the standard interview procedure, and\r\n \"C\" represents either a practice or target interview that contained\r\n all components of the cognitive interview procedure. In\r\n rapport-building sessions, interviewers talked about school\r\n activities, family life, and favorite games with the child. In\r\n standard and cognitive interview sessions, the rapport-building\r\n sessions were followed by a request from the interviewer for the child\r\n to verbalize a narrative account of \"what happened\" during an event\r\n that had been previously staged by the experimenter. This narrative\r\n account was then followed by the interviewer's request for additional\r\n information about the event. Cognitive interviews also included\r\n several additional questions that were hypothesized to improve recall\r\n performance. The number of correct items recalled and the number of\r\n incorrect items generated were used to compare the performance of\r\nchildren in the three interview conditions.",

The surveys\r\n included questions about inmate demographics (e.g., date of birth,\r\n sex, race, Hispanic origin, level of education, marital status, and\r\n number of children), the institutional facilities available to death\r\n row inmates, state laws pertaining to them, training for staff who\r\n deal with them, the usefulness of various counseling, medical, and\r\n recreational programs, whether the inmates expected to be executed,\r\n and the challenges in managing the death row population.

The IPS program was characterized by four changes in usual\r\n procedures: (1) increased supervision, (2) risk/needs assessment for\r\n substance abuse, employment, and marital/family relationships, (3)\r\n stricter enforcement of probation, and (4) a four-stage revocation\r\n procedure for technical violations. The investigators also studied\r\n whether the additional caseload of the probation officers who\r\n implemented the IPS program reduced the number of supervision contacts\r\n with non-IPS probationers under normal minimum, moderate, and maximum\r\n supervision regimens. Offenders put on IPS probation in 1985 from 13\r\n experimental courts were compared to high-risk offenders put on\r\n regular probation in the experimental courts in 1984, and to high-risk\r\n offenders on regular probation from 13 control courts for both 1984\r\n and 1985. Data were derived from risk assessment forms,\r\n needs/strengths assessment forms, probation supervision records, and\r\n criminal history data obtained from the state's probation central\r\n field. For each offender, a full range of data were collected on (1)\r\n offender risk characteristics at initial, four-month, ten-month, and\r\n termination assessments, (2) offender needs characteristics at the\r\n same intervals, (3) probation officer/offender contact chronologies\r\n for the entire one-year follow-up period, and (4) offender prior\r\ncriminal history and recidivism during a one-year follow-up period.",

-            "description": "This study examined the effects of timing and level of\r\n legal supervision in controlling antisocial behavior and promoting\r\n prosocial behavior in chronic addict offenders. The study sought to\r\n answer several questions: (1) What is the effect of legal supervision\r\n on the criminal behavior of addicts? (2) Does legal supervision have\r\n time-course effects? (3) What are the differential effects of varying\r\n types of legal supervision (e.g., probation, parole, urinalysis,\r\n higher or lower number of contacts per month)? Data were obtained by\r\n conducting retrospective interviews with four separate groups of\r\n subjects from four distinct research projects previously conducted in\r\n Southern California (McGlothlin, Anglin, and Wilson, 1977, Anglin,\r\n McGlothlin, and Speckart, 1981, Anglin, McGlothlin, Speckart, and Ryan,\r\n 1982, and McGlothlin and Anglin, 1981). The first group were male\r\n patients in the California Civil Addict Program, admitted in\r\n 1962-1964, who were interviewed for this survey in 1974-1975. The\r\n second group was a sample of addicts drawn from male first admissions\r\n between the years 1971-1973 from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and\r\n Orange County methadone maintenance programs. These respondents were\r\n interviewed during the years 1978-1979, an average of 6.6 years after\r\n admission. The third group consisted of male and female methadone\r\n maintenance patients selected from rosters of clients active on June\r\n 30, 1976, at clinics in Bakersfield and Tulare, California. These\r\n subjects were interviewed during 1978 and 1979, an average of 3.5\r\n years after admission. The fourth group of subjects consisted of males\r\n and females who were active on September 30, 1978, at San Diego,\r\n Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange County clinics and were\r\n interviewed during the years 1980-1981, an average of six years after\r\n their admission. Subjects included Anglo-American and Mexican-American\r\n males and females. The samples were generally representative of\r\n California methadone maintenance patients except for the second\r\n sample, which had been selected to study the impact of civil\r\n commitment parole status on the behavior of patients receiving\r\n methadone and was not necessarily representative of the overall\r\n population of admitted patients receiving methodone. Before the\r\n interview, a schematic time line on each offender was prepared, which\r\n included all known arrests and intervals of incarceration, legal\r\n supervision, and methadone treatment, based on criminal justice system\r\n and treatment program records. In discussion with the subject, the\r\n interviewer established the date of the first narcotics use on the time\r\n line, then proceeded chronologically through the time line, marking a\r\n change in narcotics use from less-than-daily use to daily use (or vice\r\n versa), or a change in the respondent's legal or treatment status, as\r\n a time interval. The interviewer repeated this process for successive\r\n intervals up through the date of the interview. Parts 1-8 consist of the\r\n interview data, with Forms 2 and 3 corresponding to the various\r\n intervals. There can be multiple intervals for each individual. \r\n Variables cover drug use, employment, criminal behavior, legal\r\n status, conditions of parole or probation, and drug treatment\r\n enrollment. Form 1 data contain background information on offenders,\r\n such as family and substance abuse history, and Form 4 data include\r\n other personal information as well as self-reported arrest and\r\n treatment histories. Parts 9 and 10, Master Data, were created from\r\n selected variables from the interview data. Parts 11 and 12,\r\n Arrest Data, were collected from official criminal justice records and\r\n describe each offender's arrests, such as month and year of arrest, charge,\r\n disposition, and arrest category. The datasets are split between the Southern\r\n California (Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Orange County, Bakersfield,\r\nTulare, and Riverside) and San Diego clinic locations.",

Data are available from two of the project's\r\ncomponents. In the first component, 201 rapists who were committed to\r\nMTC between 1958 and 1981 were classified. This sample was used to\r\nrevise the previous classification system (R2), upon which the\r\ndevelopment of the current system rests. Of these 201 men, 94 were in\r\nresidence at the time of the study and 107 had been released. The\r\nsecond component classified a sample of 54 rapists who were committed\r\nafter 1981. This sample was not used to develop the criteria for the\r\ntypology. As an overview, this project had two missions: (1) to\r\nsubtype about 250 rapists using MTC:R3 criteria, and (2) to utilize an\r\narchivally-derived database to examine the concurrent and predictive\r\nvalidity of the system. In addition to the subtype assignments, the\r\nprimary source of data was the detailed institutional files that were\r\nused to code a 1,500-variable questionnaire.",

Data are available from two of the project's\r\ncomponents. In the first component, 201 rapists who were committed to\r\nMTC between 1958 and 1981 were classified. This sample was used to\r\nrevise the previous classification system (R2), upon which the\r\ndevelopment of the current system rests. Of these 201 men, 94 were in\r\nresidence at the time of the study and 107 had been released. The\r\nsecond component classified a sample of 54 rapists who were committed\r\nafter 1981. This sample was not used to develop the criteria for the\r\ntypology. As an overview, this project had two missions: (1) to\r\nsubtype about 250 rapists using MTC:R3 criteria, and (2) to utilize an\r\narchivally-derived database to examine the concurrent and predictive\r\nvalidity of the system. In addition to the subtype assignments, the\r\nprimary source of data was the detailed institutional files that were\r\nused to code a 1,500-variable questionnaire.",

A consortium of municipal, county, state, and\r\n federal law enforcement agencies developed the program, which stressed\r\n user accountability. The Demand Reduction Program had two objectives:\r\n (1) to create community-wide awareness of the severity of the drug\r\n problem and to alert drug users to the increased risk of legal\r\n sanctions, and (2) to adopt a zero-tolerance position of user\r\n accountability through an emphasis on increased and coordinated law\r\n enforcement activities directed against individual offenders and\r\n special treatment programs in lieu of prosecution. Part 1 of the\r\n collection, Demand Reduction Program Data, provides information on\r\n prosecutor's disposition, arrest date, submitted charges, filed\r\n charges, prior charges, disposition of charges, drugs offender used in\r\n last three months, information on prior drug treatment, type of\r\n attorney, and arrestee's age at arrest, sex, marital status, income,\r\n and living arrangement. Part 2 is a Citizen Survey conducted in\r\n January 1990, ten months after the implementation of the Demand\r\n Reduction Program. Adult residents of Maricopa County were asked in\r\n telephone interviews about their attitudes toward drug use, tax\r\n support for drug treatment, education, and punishment, their knowledge\r\n of the Demand Reduction Program, and demographic information. Parts 3\r\n and 4 supply data from surveys of Maricopa County police officers,\r\n conducted in March 1990 and April 1991, to measure attitudes regarding\r\n the Demand Reduction Program with respect to (1) police effort, (2)\r\n inter-agency cooperation, (3) the harm involved in drug use, and (4)\r\n support for diversion to treatment. The two police surveys contained\r\n identically-worded questions, with only a small number of different\r\n questions asked the second year. Variables include officer's rank,\r\n years at rank, years in department, shift worked, age, sex, ethnicity,\r\n education, marital status, if officer was the primary or secondary\r\n wage earner, officer's perception of and training for the Demand\r\n Reduction Program, and personal attitudes toward drug use. Part 5\r\n provides arrest data from the Maricopa County Task Force, which\r\n arrested drug users through two methods: (1) sweeps of public and\r\n semi-public places, and (2) \"reversals,\" where drug sellers were\r\n arrested and replaced by police officers posing as drug sellers, who\r\n then arrested the drug buyers. Task Force data include arrest date,\r\n operation number, operation beginning and ending date, operation type,\r\n region where operation was conducted, charge resulting from arrest,\r\n Demand Reduction Program identification number, and arrestee's sex,\r\nrace, and date of birth.",

No testing occurred in cities with populations under\r\n 10,000 because of budget limitations. Fourteen questions to which the\r\n officers responded were presented in the videotape. Each police\r\n officer also completed a questionnaire that included questions on\r\n demographics, training, and work experience, covering their age, sex,\r\n race, shift worked, years of police experience, education, training on\r\n search and seizure law, effectiveness of various types of training\r\n instructors and methods, how easily they could obtain advice about\r\n search and seizure questions they encountered, and court outcomes of\r\n search and seizure cases in which they were involved. Police\r\n department representatives completed a separate questionnaire\r\n providing department characteristics and information on search and\r\n seizure training and procedures, such as the number of sworn officers,\r\n existence of general training and the number of hours required,\r\n existence of in-service search and seizure training and the number of\r\n hours and testing required, existence of policies and procedures on\r\n search and seizure, and means of advice available to officers about\r\n search and seizure questions. These data comprise Part 1. For purposes\r\n of comparison and interpretation of the police officer test scores,\r\n question responses were also obtained from other sources.

The\r\n study focused on how police response affected subsequent incidents of\r\n spouse assault. Police responses studied included arrest, issuing\r\n emergency protection orders, referring the suspect to counseling,\r\n separating the suspect and the victim, and restoring order only (no\r\n specific action). Data were obtained through initial incident reports,\r\n counseling information, and personal interviews. Follow-up interviews\r\n were conducted at three- and six-month periods, and recidivists were\r\n identified through police and court record checks. Variables from\r\n initial incident reports include number of charges, date, location,\r\n and disposition of charges, weapon(s) used, victim injuries, medical\r\n attention received, behavior towards police, victim and suspect\r\n comments, and demographic information such as race, sex, relationship\r\n to victim/offender, age, and past victim/offender history. Data\r\n collected from counseling forms provide information on demographic\r\n characteristics of the suspect, type of counseling, topics covered in\r\n counseling, suspect's level of participation, and therapist comments.\r\n Court records investigate victim and suspect criminal histories,\r\n including descriptions of charges and their disposition, conditions of\r\n pretrial release, and the victim's contact with pretrial services.\r\n Other variables included in follow-up checks focus on criminal and\r\n offense history of the suspect.

-            "description": "This project examined the characteristics of sexual assault victimizations in Alaska, as observed and recorded by sexual assault nurse examiners in Anchorage, Kodiak, Bethel, Soldotna, Nome, Fairbanks, Homer, and Kotzebue. The sample utilized for this study included all sexual assault nurse examinations conducted in Anchorage from 1996 to 2004, in Bethel and Fairbanks in 2005 and 2006, and in Homer, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Nome, and Soldotna in 2005. A total of 1,699 examinations were collected. More specifically, the information contains  demographic characteristics of patients, pre-assault patient characteristics, assault characteristics, post assault characteristics, exam characteristics and findings, and suspect characteristics. Demographic characteristics of patients include gender, race / ethnicity, and age, whether the patient was disabled, and whether the patient reported being homeless. Pre-assault characteristics included whether the patient reported engaging in consensual sexual activity within three days prior to the assault and information on the location of the initial contact with the suspect. Assault characteristics included information on the location of the assault, methods employed by the suspect, the patients' condition at the time of the assault, the patients' use of drugs and alcohol, and a detailed description of the assault itself. This detailed description included the patient's position during the assault, whether condoms and lubricants had been used, whether ejaculation had occurred, and an inventory of 17 different sexual acts. Post-assault characteristics included information on post-assault actions taken by the patient, whether the patient engaged in consensual sexual activity between the time of the assault to the examination, and the time elapsed from the assault to the examination. Exam characteristics and findings included information on whether the exam was completed, the type of exam that was conducted, the patients' behavioral and emotional state during the exam, whether the patient required emergency medical care, whether the presence of sperm was documented, whether patients tested positive for sexually transmitted infections or other genital infections, whether the patient was pregnant, and whether injuries were documented. Injury characteristics included descriptions of both non-genital and genital injury. A total of 108 indicators of non-genital injury were captured. These included nine possible injuries (i.e., bruising, redness, abrasions, lacerations, swelling, fractures, bite marks, pain, and other) to 12 possible sites (i.e., head/face, mouth, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, abdomen, back, buttocks/hips, legs, and feet). A total of 60 indicators of genital injury were also captured. These included four possible injuries (i.e., bruising, abrasions, lacerations, and tenderness) to 15 possible sites (i.e., mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, labia majora / minora junction, clitoral hood, clitoris, periurethra, hymen, fossa navicularis, posterior fourchette, perineum, vaginal walls, cervix, anus, and rectum). Suspect characteristics included the number of suspects, whether the identity of the suspect was known, demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, and age), whether the suspect had used alcohol or drugs, and the relationship between the patient and the suspect. In addition to providing detailed information from sexual assault nurse examinations, the data also include three indicators of legal resolutions - whether cases were referred for prosecution, whether cases were accepted for prosecution, and whether cases resulted in a conviction. Data on legal resolutions are only available for 1,229 cases examined from 1999 to 2005.",

Specific elder mistreatment categories included emotional, physical, sexual, financial, and neglect.",

The study examined the problem of FTA via a two-stage experiment. In Phase 1, 7,865 misdemeanor defendants from 14 Nebraska counties were randomly assigned to one of four reminder conditions: (1) a no-reminder (control) condition; (2) a reminder-only condition; (3) a condition in which the reminder also made them aware of possible sanctions should they fail to appear (reminder-sanctions); or (4) a condition in which the reminder mentioned sanctions but also highlighted aspects of procedural justice (PJ), such as voice, neutrality, respect, and public interest (reminder-combined).  Data collection began in March 2009 and continued through May 2010. Files were received daily from the Nebraska Administrative Office of the Courts containing information about cases filed in each of the 14 counties included in the study. Upon receipt of this file, researchers screened participants using certain eligibility criteria. Researchers mailed postcard reminders two to five business days prior to the scheduled court appearance.  Approximately one week after each scheduled court appearance researchers accessed the courts' administrative database (JUSTICE) to determine whether the defendant actually appeared for the scheduled hearing. Upon accessing this information, researchers recorded this variable, which is the primary dependent variable in the study.  At the same time researchers recorded the appearance variable, they selected participants for Phase 2 of the study -- a mail survey administered after their scheduled appearance (or non-appearance) to assess their perceptions of procedural fairness and their level of trust/confidence in the courts.  To do so, researchers selected all participants who failed to appear for their court date to receive a survey. Twenty percent of defendants who did appear were also randomly selected to receive a survey.  Surveys were sent to a total of 2,360 individuals and were received from a total of 452 defendants.  The study contains a total of 197 variables including demographics, court appearance characteristics, experiment characteristics, charge/offense variables, and variables from surveys about experiences with the court system.",

-            "description": "The purpose of the research was to learn about the effectiveness of supervision of domestic violence offenders on probation. Specifically, the study sought to determine which, if any, probation practices promote victim safety and hold offenders accountable.  This study used several data collection strategies to better evaluate and compare two domestic violence offender case management strategies. The quantitative analysis was based on the findings from a nonrandom representative sample of 551 male probationers drawn from the nearly 3,000 misdemeanor domestic probationers in Rhode Island as of January 1, 2003. These offenders were, at the time of their sentencing, placed in either a regular or specialized domestic violence caseload determined by probation policies for each of 10 caseloads included in the study. A total of 182 offenders were placed on traditional supervision, while 369 offenders were placed in a specialized domestic violence unit. The probationers were tracked through January 1, 2004, to determine recidivism and reabuse differences between these supervision approaches.  There were three measures used to determine reabuse and recidivism: (1) rearrest for either an offense classified as domestic violence or for any other offense resulting in the defendant being charged and arraigned in a Rhode Island court; (2) a police report filed for an incident classified as domestic violence, whether or not an arrest was made; and (3) a victim report of domestic violence obtained in study interviews (see Data Collection Notes).  The data file contains 115 variables including basic information regarding the offender such as age, caseload number, and caseload type.  Additional variables detail the relationship between the offender and the victim, as well as the offender's previous arrest record, and previous domestic violence incidents involving the offender.",

This study used several data collection strategies to better evaluate and compare two domestic violence offender case management strategies. The quantitative analysis was based on the findings from a nonrandom representative sample of 551 male probationers drawn from the nearly 3,000 misdemeanor domestic probationers in Rhode Island as of January 1, 2003. These offenders were, at the time of their sentencing, placed in either a regular or specialized domestic violence caseload determined by probation policies for each of 10 caseloads included in the study. A total of 182 offenders were placed on traditional supervision, while 369 offenders were placed in a specialized domestic violence unit. The probationers were tracked through January 1, 2004, to determine recidivism and reabuse differences between these supervision approaches.  There were three measures used to determine reabuse and recidivism: (1) rearrest for either an offense classified as domestic violence or for any other offense resulting in the defendant being charged and arraigned in a Rhode Island court; (2) a police report filed for an incident classified as domestic violence, whether or not an arrest was made; and (3) a victim report of domestic violence obtained in study interviews (see Data Collection Notes).  The data file contains 115 variables including basic information regarding the offender such as age, caseload number, and caseload type.  Additional variables detail the relationship between the offender and the victim, as well as the offender's previous arrest record, and previous domestic violence incidents involving the offender.",

The\r\ncreation of a special police unit to focus exclusively on misdemeanor\r\ndomestic crimes was the centerpiece of the plan. This police unit, the\r\nDomestic Violence Reduction Unit (DVRU), had two goals: to increase\r\nthe sanctions for batterers and to empower victims. This study was\r\ndesigned to determine whether DVRU strategies led to reductions in\r\ndomestic violence. Data were collected from official records on\r\nbatterers (Parts 1-10), and from surveys on victims (Parts 11-12).\r\nPart 1 (Police Recorded Study Case Data) provides information on\r\npolice custody reports. Part 2 (Batterer Arrest History Data)\r\ndescribes the arrest history during a five-year period prior to each\r\nbatterer's study case arrest date. Part 3 (Charges Data for Study Case\r\nArrests) contains charges filed by the prosecutor's office in\r\nconjunction with study case arrests. Part 4 (Jail Data) reports\r\nbooking charges and jail information. Part 5 (Court Data) contains\r\nsentencing information for those offenders who had either entered a\r\nguilty plea or had been found guilty of the charges stemming from the\r\nstudy case arrest. Data in Part 6 (Restraining Order Data) document\r\nthe existence of restraining orders, before and/or after the study\r\ncase arrest date. Part 7 (Diversion Program Data) includes deferred\r\nsentencing program information for study cases. Variables in Parts 1-7\r\nprovide information on number of batterer's arrests for domestic\r\nviolence and non-domestic violence crimes in the past five years,\r\ncharge and disposition of the study case, booking charges, number of\r\nhours offender spent in jail, type of release, type of sentence, if\r\nrestraining order was filed after case arrest, if restraining order\r\nwas served or vacated, number of days offender stayed in diversion\r\nprogram, and type of diversion violation incurred. Part 8 (Domestic\r\nViolence Reduction Unit Treatment Data) contains 395 of the 404 study\r\ncases that were randomly assigned to the treatment condition.\r\nVariables describe the types of services DVRU provided, such as taking\r\nphotographs along with victim statements, providing the victim with\r\ninformation on case prosecution, restraining orders, shelters,\r\ncounseling, and an appointment with district attorney, helping the\r\nvictim get a restraining order, serving a restraining order on the\r\nbatterer, transporting the victim to a shelter, and providing the\r\nvictim with a motel voucher and emergency food supply. Part 9 (Police\r\nRecord Recidivism Data) includes police entries (incident or arrest)\r\nsix months before and six months after the study case arrest\r\ndate. Part 10 (Police Recorded Revictimization and Reoffending Data)\r\nconsists of revictimization and reoffending summary counts as well as\r\ntime-to-failure data. Most of the variables in Part 10 were derived\r\nfrom information reported in Part 9. Part 9 and Part 10 variables\r\ninclude whether the offense in each incident was related to domestic\r\nviolence, whether victimization was done by the same batterer as in\r\nthe study case arrest, type of police action against the\r\nvictimization, charges of the victimization, type of premises where\r\nthe crime was committed, whether the police report indicated that\r\nwitnesses or children were present, whether the police report\r\nmentioned victim injury, weapon used, involvement of drugs or alcohol,\r\nwhether the batterer denied abuse victim, number of days from study\r\ncases to police-recorded revictimization, and whether the recorded\r\nvictimization led to the batterer's arrest. Part 11 (Wave 1 Victim\r\nInterview Data) contains data obtained through in-person interviews\r\nwith victims shortly (1-2 weeks) after the case entered the\r\nstudy. Data in Part 12 (Wave 2 Victim Interview Data) represent\r\nvictims' responses to the second wave of interviews, conducted\r\napproximately six months after the study case victimization occurred.\r\nVariables in Part 11 and Part 12 cover the victim's experience six\r\nmonths before the study case arrest and six months after the study\r\ncase arrest. Demographic variables in both files include victim's and\r\nbatterer's race and ethnicity, employment, and income, and\r\nrelationship status between victim and batterer. Information on\r\nchildhood experiences includes whether the victim and batterer felt\r\nemotionally cared for by parents, whether the victim and batterer\r\nwitnessed violence between parents while growing up, and whether the\r\nvictim and batterer were abused as children by a family member.\r\nVariables on the batterer's abusive behaviors include whether the\r\nbatterer threatened to kill, swore at, pushed or grabbed, slapped,\r\nbeat, or forced the victim to have sex. Information on the results of\r\nthe abuse includes whether the abuse led to cuts or bruises, broken\r\nbones, burns, internal injury, or damage to eyes or ears. Information\r\nwas also collected on whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the\r\nabuse events. Variables on victims' actions after the event include\r\nwhether the victim saw a doctor, whether the victim talked to a\r\nminister, a family member, a friend, a mental health professional, or\r\na district attorney, whether the victim tried to get an arrest\r\nwarrant, went to a shelter to talk, and/or stayed at a shelter,\r\nwhether the victim asked police to intervene, tried to get a\r\nrestraining order, talked to an attorney, or undertook other actions,\r\nand whether the event led to the batterer's arrest. Variables on\r\nvictim satisfaction with the police and the DVRU include whether\r\npolice or the DVRU were able to calm things down, recommended going to\r\nthe district attorney, informed the victim of her legal rights,\r\nrecommended that the victim contact shelter or support groups,\r\ntransported the victim to a hospital, and listened to the victim,\r\nwhether police treated the victim with respect, and whether the victim\r\nwould want police or the DVRU involved in the future if needed.\r\nVariables on the victim's emotional state include whether the victim\r\nwas confident that she could keep herself safe, felt her family life\r\nwas under control, and felt she was doing all she could to get\r\nhelp. Other variables include number of children the victim had and\r\ntheir ages, and whether the children had seen violence between the\r\nvictim and batterer.",

TOW is a voluntary, six-month program that\r\nworks with inmates to identify the causes of their addictive behaviors\r\nand encourage changes in unacceptable behaviors and criminal\r\nthinking. The Iowa Consortium for Substance Abuse Research and\r\nEvaluation conducted an evaluation of TOW from October 1997 through\r\nMarch 2001. The Iowa Consortium worked extensively with the Clarinda\r\nTWO treatment staff to identify valid and reliable instruments that\r\nmeasured substance use and abuse, mental health and personality\r\ncharacteristics, criminal behavior and attitudes, social support, and\r\ninvolvement in education, employment, and therapeutic\r\nactivities. These instruments were used to collect data at intake and\r\ndischarge. Additionally, the researchers conducted a six-month\r\nfollow-up of inmates to determine their post-program experiences as\r\nwell as recidivism. Part 1 (Clinical and Recidivism Data) consists of\r\nselected variables gathered during the clinical interviews\r\nadministered to program participants at intake and discharge, as well\r\nas recidivism data from the Department of Corrections. Part 2\r\n(Follow-Up Data) consists of variables from the Addiction Severity\r\nIndex, which were collected during the six-month follow-up telephone\r\ninterview.",

TOW is a voluntary, six-month program that\r\nworks with inmates to identify the causes of their addictive behaviors\r\nand encourage changes in unacceptable behaviors and criminal\r\nthinking. The Iowa Consortium for Substance Abuse Research and\r\nEvaluation conducted an evaluation of TOW from October 1997 through\r\nMarch 2001. The Iowa Consortium worked extensively with the Clarinda\r\nTWO treatment staff to identify valid and reliable instruments that\r\nmeasured substance use and abuse, mental health and personality\r\ncharacteristics, criminal behavior and attitudes, social support, and\r\ninvolvement in education, employment, and therapeutic\r\nactivities. These instruments were used to collect data at intake and\r\ndischarge. Additionally, the researchers conducted a six-month\r\nfollow-up of inmates to determine their post-program experiences as\r\nwell as recidivism. Part 1 (Clinical and Recidivism Data) consists of\r\nselected variables gathered during the clinical interviews\r\nadministered to program participants at intake and discharge, as well\r\nas recidivism data from the Department of Corrections. Part 2\r\n(Follow-Up Data) consists of variables from the Addiction Severity\r\nIndex, which were collected during the six-month follow-up telephone\r\ninterview.",

In order to evaluate the\r\n implementation and effectiveness of the FDVC, the researchers selected\r\n three samples of cases for collection of detailed data and comparisons\r\n on case characteristics, processing, and outcomes. First, felony\r\n domestic violence cases indicted from 1995 to early 1996 before the\r\n FDVC was established, and adjudicated by various parts of the state\r\n Supreme Court were studied. These pre-FDVC cases provided a comparison\r\n group for assessing differences associated with the FDVC model. Very\r\n few of these cases had felony protection order violations as the sole\r\n or top indictment charge, since they predated the implementation of\r\n the expanded criminal contempt law that went into effect in September\r\n 1996. Second, a sample of cases adjudicated by FDVC in its early\r\n period (the first half of 1997, after the model was fully implemented)\r\n and similar in indictment charges to the pre-FDVC cases was\r\n selected. These were cases that had indictment charges other than, or\r\n in addition to, felony criminal contempt charges for protection order\r\n violations. In other words, these were cases that would have been\r\n indicted and adjudicated in the state Supreme Court even without\r\n application of the September 1996 law. Third, because the September\r\n 1996 law felonizing many protection order violations (under criminal\r\n contempt statutes) broadened the types of cases handled by the Supreme\r\n Court, compared with those handled in the Supreme Court prior to this\r\n law, an additional sample of cases adjudicated by the FDVC (beginning\r\n in the first half of 1997) was selected. This was a small sample in\r\n which felony protection order violations were the only indicted felony\r\n charges. These cases would not have been indicted on felonies during\r\n the pre-FDVC period, and so would have remained in the criminal courts\r\n as misdemeanors. The inclusion of this sample allowed the researchers\r\n to assess how the protection order violation cases were different from\r\n the general population of FDVC cases, and how they might be handled\r\n differently by the Court and partner agencies. These cases were\r\n designated \"CC-only\" because their only felony indictment was for\r\n criminal contempt, the law under which felony protection order\r\n violations were charged. Variables in Part 1, Recidivism Data, contain\r\n information on number of appearance warrants issued, days incarcerated\r\n for predisposition, number of appearances for predisposition and\r\n post-disposition, bail conditions (i.e., batterer treatment or drug\r\n treatment), top charge at arrest, indictment, and disposition,\r\n indications of defendant's substance abuse of alcohol, marijuana, or\r\n other drugs, and psychological problems, types of disposition and\r\n probation, months of incarceration, sentence conditions, history of\r\n abuse by defendant against the victim, length of abuse in months,\r\n history of physical assault and sexual abuse, past weapon use, and\r\n medical attention needed for past domestic violence. Additional\r\n variables focus on whether an order of protection was issued before\r\n the current incident, whether the defendant was arrested for past\r\n domestic violence with this victim, total number of known victims,\r\n weapon used during incident, injury during the incident, medical\r\n attention sought, number of final orders of protection, whether the\r\n defendant was jailed throughout the pending case, number of releases\r\n during the case, number of reincarcerations after release, whether the\r\n victim lived with the defendant, whether the victim lived with\r\n children in common with the defendant, relationship between the victim\r\n and the defendant, number of months the victim had known the\r\n defendant, number of children in common with the defendant, whether\r\n the victim attempted to drop charges, whether the victim testified at\r\n trial, whether a victim advocate was assigned, total violations during\r\n pending case, predisposition violations, and number of probation\r\n violations. Demographic variables in Part 1 include defendant and\r\n victims' gender, race, victim age at defendant's arrest, defendant's\r\n income, employment status, and education. Variables in Part 2, Top\r\n Charge Data, relating to the defendant include number and types of\r\n prior arrests and convictions, top charge at arrest, severity of top\r\n charge at arrest, top charge at grand jury indictment, severity of top\r\n charge indictment, disposition details, Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)\r\n arrest indicators, child victim conviction indicator, drug conviction\r\n indicator, weapon conviction indicator, types of probation, sentence,\r\n disposition, and offenses. Demographic variables in Part 2 include sex\r\nand race of the defendant.",

Data were collected from four separate sources and then\r\n merged into a single dataset using the county Federal Information\r\n Processing Standards (FIPS) code as the attribute of common\r\n identification. The data sources included: (1) local police agency\r\n responses to three waves (1996, 1997, and 1998) of the National Youth\r\n Gang Survey (NYGS), (2) rural-urban classification and county-level\r\n measures of primary economic activity from the Economic Research\r\n Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture, (3)\r\n county-level economic and demographic data from the County and City\r\n Data Book, 1994, and from USA Counties, 1998, produced by the United\r\n States Department of Commerce, and (4) county-level data on access to\r\n interstate highways provided by Tom Ricketts and Randy Randolph of the\r\n University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Variables include the\r\n FIPS codes for state, county, county subdivision, and sub-county,\r\n population in the agency jurisdiction, type of jurisdiction, and\r\n whether the county was dependent on farming, mining, manufacturing, or\r\n government. Other variables categorizing counties include retirement\r\n destination, federal lands, commuting, persistent poverty, and\r\n transfer payments. The year gang problems began in that jurisdiction,\r\n number of youth groups, number of active gangs, number of active gang\r\n members, percent of gang members who migrated, and the number of gangs\r\n in 1996, 1997, and 1998 are also available. Rounding out the variables\r\n are unemployment rates, median household income, percent of persons in\r\n county below poverty level, percent of family households that were\r\n one-parent households, percent of housing units in the county that\r\n were vacant, had no telephone, or were renter-occupied, resident\r\n population of the county in 1990 and 1997, change in unemployment\r\n rates, land area of county, percent of persons in the county speaking\r\n Spanish at home, and whether an interstate highway intersected the\r\ncounty.",

It was also\r\n designed to provide a comparative analysis of social, economic, and\r\n demographic differences among non-metropolitan jurisdictions in which\r\n gangs were reported to have been persistent problems, those in which\r\n gangs had been more transitory, and those that reported no gang\r\n problems. Data were collected from four separate sources and then\r\n merged into a single dataset using the county Federal Information\r\n Processing Standards (FIPS) code as the attribute of common\r\n identification. The data sources included: (1) local police agency\r\n responses to three waves (1996, 1997, and 1998) of the National Youth\r\n Gang Survey (NYGS), (2) rural-urban classification and county-level\r\n measures of primary economic activity from the Economic Research\r\n Service (ERS) of the United States Department of Agriculture, (3)\r\n county-level economic and demographic data from the County and City\r\n Data Book, 1994, and from USA Counties, 1998, produced by the United\r\n States Department of Commerce, and (4) county-level data on access to\r\n interstate highways provided by Tom Ricketts and Randy Randolph of the\r\n University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Variables include the\r\n FIPS codes for state, county, county subdivision, and sub-county,\r\n population in the agency jurisdiction, type of jurisdiction, and\r\n whether the county was dependent on farming, mining, manufacturing, or\r\n government. Other variables categorizing counties include retirement\r\n destination, federal lands, commuting, persistent poverty, and\r\n transfer payments. The year gang problems began in that jurisdiction,\r\n number of youth groups, number of active gangs, number of active gang\r\n members, percent of gang members who migrated, and the number of gangs\r\n in 1996, 1997, and 1998 are also available. Rounding out the variables\r\n are unemployment rates, median household income, percent of persons in\r\n county below poverty level, percent of family households that were\r\n one-parent households, percent of housing units in the county that\r\n were vacant, had no telephone, or were renter-occupied, resident\r\n population of the county in 1990 and 1997, change in unemployment\r\n rates, land area of county, percent of persons in the county speaking\r\n Spanish at home, and whether an interstate highway intersected the\r\ncounty.",

Data were collected in\r\n2002 at four separate times (quarterly) during the year in 36\r\nmetropolitan areas in the United States. The ADAM program adopted a new\r\ninstrument in 2000 in adult booking facilities for male (Part 1) and\r\nfemale (Part 2) arrestees. Data from arrestees in juvenile detention\r\nfacilities (Part 3) continued to use the juvenile instrument from\r\nprevious years, extending back through the DRUG USE FORECASTING series\r\n(ICPSR 9477). The ADAM program in 2002 also continued the use of\r\nprobability-based sampling for male arrestees in adult facilities, which\r\nwas initiated in 2000. Therefore, the male adult sample includes\r\nweights, generated through post-sampling stratification of the data. For\r\nthe adult files, variables fell into one of eight categories: (1)\r\ndemographic data on each arrestee, (2) ADAM facesheet (records-based)\r\ndata, (3) data on disposition of the case, including accession to a\r\nverbal consent script, (4) calendar of admissions to substance abuse and\r\nmental health treatment programs, (5) data on alcohol and drug use,\r\nabuse, and dependence, (6) drug acquisition data covering the five most\r\ncommonly used illicit drugs, (7) urine test results, and (8) weights.\r\nThe juvenile file contains demographic variables and arrestee's\r\nself-reported past and continued use of 15 drugs, as well as other\r\ndrug-related behaviors.",

Data were collected in\r\n2002 at four separate times (quarterly) during the year in 36\r\nmetropolitan areas in the United States. The ADAM program adopted a new\r\ninstrument in 2000 in adult booking facilities for male (Part 1) and\r\nfemale (Part 2) arrestees. Data from arrestees in juvenile detention\r\nfacilities (Part 3) continued to use the juvenile instrument from\r\nprevious years, extending back through the DRUG USE FORECASTING series\r\n(ICPSR 9477). The ADAM program in 2002 also continued the use of\r\nprobability-based sampling for male arrestees in adult facilities, which\r\nwas initiated in 2000. Therefore, the male adult sample includes\r\nweights, generated through post-sampling stratification of the data. For\r\nthe adult files, variables fell into one of eight categories: (1)\r\ndemographic data on each arrestee, (2) ADAM facesheet (records-based)\r\ndata, (3) data on disposition of the case, including accession to a\r\nverbal consent script, (4) calendar of admissions to substance abuse and\r\nmental health treatment programs, (5) data on alcohol and drug use,\r\nabuse, and dependence, (6) drug acquisition data covering the five most\r\ncommonly used illicit drugs, (7) urine test results, and (8) weights.\r\nThe juvenile file contains demographic variables and arrestee's\r\nself-reported past and continued use of 15 drugs, as well as other\r\ndrug-related behaviors.",

The research team developed three research modules that\r\nemployed a variety of data sources and approaches to understand family\r\ndestabilization and community distress, which cannot be observed\r\ndirectly. These three research modules were used to discover causal\r\nrelationships between male withdrawal from productive spheres of the\r\neconomy and resulting changes in the community and families. The\r\nresearch modules approached the issue of sentencing guidelines and\r\nfamily structure by studying: (1) the flow of inmates into prison\r\n(Module A), (2) the role of and issues related to sentencing reform\r\n(Module B), and family disruption in a single state (Module C). Module\r\nA utilized the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program data for 1984 and\r\n1993 (Parts 1 and 2), the 1984 and 1993 National Correctional\r\nReporting Program (NCRP) data (Parts 3-6), the Urban Institute's 1980\r\nand 1990 Underclass Database (UDB) (Part 7), the 1985 and 1994\r\nNational Longitudinal Survey on Youth (NLSY) (Parts 8 and 9), and\r\ncounty population, social, and economic data from the Current\r\nPopulation Survey, County Business Patterns, and United States Vital\r\nStatistics (Parts 10-12). The focus of this module was the\r\nrelationship between family instability, as measured by female-headed\r\nfamilies, and three societal characteristics, namely underclass\r\nmeasures in county of residence, individual characteristics, and flows\r\nof inmates. Module B examined the effects of statewide incarceration\r\nand sentencing changes on marriage markets and family\r\nstructure. Module B utilized data from the Current Population Survey\r\nfor 1985 and 1994 (Part 12) and the United States Statistical\r\nAbstracts (Part 13), as well as state-level data (Parts 14 and 15) to\r\nmeasure the Darity-Myers sex ratio and expected welfare income. The\r\nrelationship between these two factors and family structure,\r\nsentencing guidelines, and minimum sentences for drug-related crimes\r\nwas then measured. Module C used data collected from inmates entering\r\nthe Minnesota prison system in 1997 and 1998 (Part 16), information\r\nfrom the 1990 Census (Part 17), and the Minnesota Crime Survey\r\n(Part 18) to assess any connections between incarceration and family\r\nstructure. Module C focused on a single state with sentencing\r\nguidelines with the goal of understanding how sentencing reforms and\r\nthe impacts of the local community factors affect inmate family\r\nstructure. The researchers wanted to know if the aspects of locations\r\nthat lose marriageable males to prison were more important than\r\nindividual inmate characteristics with respect to the probability that\r\nsomeone will be imprisoned and leave behind dependent\r\nchildren. Variables in Parts 1 and 2 document arrests by race for\r\narson, assault, auto theft, burglary, drugs, homicide, larceny,\r\nmanslaughter, rape, robbery, sexual assault, and weapons. Variables in\r\nParts 3 and 4 document prison admissions, while variables in Parts 5\r\nand 6 document prison releases. Variables in Part 7 include the number\r\nof households on public assistance, education and income levels of\r\nresidents by race, labor force participation by race, unemployment by\r\nrace, percentage of population of different races, poverty rate by\r\nrace, men in the military by race, and marriage pool by\r\nrace. Variables in Parts 8 and 9 include age, county, education,\r\nemployment status, family income, marital status, race, residence\r\ntype, sex, and state. Part 10 provides county population data. Part 11\r\ncontains two different state identifiers. Variables in Part 12\r\ndescribe mortality data and welfare data. Part 13 contains data from\r\nthe United States Statistical Abstracts, including welfare and poverty\r\nvariables. Variables in Parts 14 and 15 include number of children,\r\nage, education, family type, gender, head of household, marital\r\nstatus, race, religion, and state. Variables in Part 16 cover\r\nadmission date, admission type, age, county, education, language,\r\nlength of sentence, marital status, military status, sentence, sex,\r\nstate, and ZIP code. Part 17 contains demographic data by Minnesota\r\nZIP code, such as age categories, race, divorces, number of children,\r\nhome ownership, and unemployment. Part 18 includes Minnesota crime\r\ndata as well as some demographic variables, such as race, education,\r\nand poverty ratio.",

-            "description": "This study examined the criminal careers of 1,331 offenders\r\n convicted of white-collar crimes in the United States District Courts\r\n to assess the relative effectiveness of court-imposed prison sanctions\r\n in preventing or modifying future criminal behavior. The white-collar\r\n crime event that was the central focus of this study, the\r\n \"criterion\" offense, provided the standard point of entry for sample\r\n members. Researchers for this study supplemented the data collected by\r\n Wheeler et al. in their 1988 study (NATURE AND SANCTIONING OF WHITE\r\n COLLAR CRIME, 1976-1978: FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICTS [ICPSR 8989]) with\r\n criminal history data subsequent to the criterion offense through to\r\n 1990. As in the 1988 study, white-collar crime was considered to\r\n include economic offenses committed through the use of some\r\n combination of fraud, deception, or collusion. Eight federal offenses\r\n were examined: antitrust, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, false\r\n claims and statements, credit fraud, bank embezzlement, income tax\r\n fraud, and bribery. Arrests were chosen as the major measure of\r\n criminal conduct. The data contain information coded from Federal\r\n Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history records (\"rap\r\n sheets\") for a set of offenders convicted of white-collar crimes in\r\n federal courts in fiscal years 1976 to 1978. The seven federal\r\n judicial districts from which the sample was drawn were central\r\n California, northern Georgia, northern Illinois, Maryland, southern\r\n New York, northern Texas, and western Washington. To correct for a\r\n bias that can be introduced when desistance from criminality is\r\n confused with the death of the offender, the researchers examined the\r\n National Death Index (NDI) data to identify offenders who had died\r\n between the date of sentencing for the criterion offense and when data\r\n collection began for this study in 1990. This data collection contains\r\n three types of records. The first record type (Part 1, Summary Data)\r\n contains summary and descriptive information about the offender's rap\r\n sheet as a whole. Variables include dates of first entry and last\r\n entry on the rap sheet, number of separate crimes on the rap sheet,\r\n whether the criterion crime was listed on the rap sheet, whether the\r\n rap sheet listed crimes prior to or subsequent to the criterion crime,\r\n and date of death of offender. The second and third record types are\r\n provided in one data file (Part 2, Event and Event Interim Data). The\r\n second record type contains information about each crime event on the\r\n rap sheet.

The white-collar\r\n crime event that was the central focus of this study, the\r\n \"criterion\" offense, provided the standard point of entry for sample\r\n members. Researchers for this study supplemented the data collected by\r\n Wheeler et al. in their 1988 study (NATURE AND SANCTIONING OF WHITE\r\n COLLAR CRIME, 1976-1978: FEDERAL JUDICIAL DISTRICTS [ICPSR 8989]) with\r\n criminal history data subsequent to the criterion offense through to\r\n 1990. As in the 1988 study, white-collar crime was considered to\r\n include economic offenses committed through the use of some\r\n combination of fraud, deception, or collusion. Eight federal offenses\r\n were examined: antitrust, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, false\r\n claims and statements, credit fraud, bank embezzlement, income tax\r\n fraud, and bribery. Arrests were chosen as the major measure of\r\n criminal conduct. The data contain information coded from Federal\r\n Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal history records (\"rap\r\n sheets\") for a set of offenders convicted of white-collar crimes in\r\n federal courts in fiscal years 1976 to 1978. The seven federal\r\n judicial districts from which the sample was drawn were central\r\n California, northern Georgia, northern Illinois, Maryland, southern\r\n New York, northern Texas, and western Washington. To correct for a\r\n bias that can be introduced when desistance from criminality is\r\n confused with the death of the offender, the researchers examined the\r\n National Death Index (NDI) data to identify offenders who had died\r\n between the date of sentencing for the criterion offense and when data\r\n collection began for this study in 1990. This data collection contains\r\n three types of records. The first record type (Part 1, Summary Data)\r\n contains summary and descriptive information about the offender's rap\r\n sheet as a whole. Variables include dates of first entry and last\r\n entry on the rap sheet, number of separate crimes on the rap sheet,\r\n whether the criterion crime was listed on the rap sheet, whether the\r\n rap sheet listed crimes prior to or subsequent to the criterion crime,\r\n and date of death of offender. The second and third record types are\r\n provided in one data file (Part 2, Event and Event Interim Data). The\r\n second record type contains information about each crime event on the\r\n rap sheet. Variables include custody status of offender at arrest,\r\n type of arresting agency, state of arrest, date of arrest, number of\r\n charges for each arrest, number of charges resulting in no formal\r\n charges filed, number of charges dismissed, number of charges for\r\n white-collar crimes, type of sanction, length of definite sentence,\r\n probation sentence, and suspended probation sentence, amount of fines,\r\n amount of court costs, and restitution ordered, first, second, and\r\n third offense charged, arrest and court disposition for each charge,\r\n and date of disposition. The third record type contains information\r\n about the interim period between events or between the final event and\r\n the end of the follow-up period. Variables include date of first,\r\n second, and third incarceration, date discharged or transferred from\r\n each incarceration, custody/supervision status at each incarceration,\r\n total number of prisons, jails, or other institutions resided in\r\n during the interval, final custody/supervision status and date\r\n discharged from incarceration for the interval, dates parole and\r\n probation started and expired, if parole or probation terms were\r\n changed or completed, amount of fines, court costs, and restitution\r\n paid, whether the conviction was overturned during the interval, and\r\n date the conviction was overturned. A single offender has as many of\r\n record types two and three as were needed to code the entire rap\r\nsheet.",

-            "description": "This project sought to analyze states' and municipalities'\r\n terrorism preparedness as a means of providing law enforcement with\r\n information about the prevention and control of terrorist activities\r\n in the United States. To accomplish this objective, a national survey\r\n of state and local law enforcement agencies was conducted to assess\r\n how law enforcement agencies below the federal level perceive the\r\n threat of terrorism in the United States and to identify potentially\r\n promising anti- and counter-terrorism programs currently used by these\r\n jurisdictions. For the purposes of this survey, the researchers used\r\n the legal definition of terrorism as provided by the Federal Bureau of\r\n Investigation (FBI), which is \"the unlawful use of force or violence\r\n against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the\r\n civilian population, or any segment of either, to further political or\r\n social objectives.\" However, incidents reported by state or local law\r\n enforcement agencies as potential terrorist incidents often are\r\n reclassified as ordinary crimes by the FBI if the FBI investigation\r\n does not reveal evidence that more than one crime was intended to be\r\n committed or that a network of individuals had prepared to carry out\r\n additional acts. Since these reported potential terrorist incidents\r\n may provide important early warnings that an organized terrorism\r\n effort is emerging, the researchers broadened the official definition\r\n to include suspected incidents and state and local officials'\r\n perceptions of crime due to terrorism. Three distinct jurisdictions\r\n with overlapping responsibilities for terrorism preparedness were\r\n surveyed in this study: (1) state law enforcement agencies, in most\r\n cases the state police, (2) organizations with emergency preparedness\r\n responsibilities and statewide authority but with limited powers of\r\n law enforcement, and (3) local law enforcement agencies, such as\r\n municipal police and sheriff departments. Similar questions were asked\r\n for all three jurisdiction groups. Variables pertaining to the\r\n organization include questions about contingency plans, guidelines,\r\n and special police training for dealing with threats of terrorism, the\r\n amount and types of information and resources exchanged among various\r\n agencies, and whether the agency had a special terrorism unit and, if\r\n so, its duties. Variables dealing with threat assessment include\r\n whether the agency had identified right-wing, left-wing,\r\n international, ethnic/emigre, or special-issue terrorist groups within\r\n their jurisdiction and how many incidents were attributed to each\r\n group. Additional variables provide information on whether the agency\r\n was involved in investigating any terrorist incidents and the type of\r\n support received from other agencies for these investigations. The\r\n risk assessment section of the survey sought information on whether\r\n the agency had conducted a risk assessment and what potential\r\n terrorist targets were present in their jurisdiction. Questions in the\r\n threat environment section cover the respondent's assessment of the\r\n impact of the Persian Gulf War, the agency's sources of information\r\n pertaining to terrorism, the likelihood of terrorist attacks on\r\n various major installations nationally, and the likelihood of a major\r\n attack in their jurisdiction. Administrative variables include the\r\n number of sworn officers or professional staff, number of support\r\n staff, department's budget for the current fiscal year, whether the\r\n agency received federal funds, and what percentage of the federal\r\nfunds were used for anti-terrorism efforts.",

Multiplying these two figures would yield an estimate of the\r\n annual financial cost of mental health care for crime victims. For\r\n this survey, mental health professionals were sampled from eight\r\n professional organizations and were asked questions about their\r\n clients during 1991. Respondents were instructed to count only those\r\n clients whose primary reason for being treated was because they were\r\n previously crime victims, regardless of whether the criminal\r\n victimization was the presenting issue at the time the client was\r\n first treated. Interviews were structured to first elicit information\r\n about the number of victims served for each type of crime. Respondents\r\n were then asked for details about the type and length of treatment for\r\n the crime type most frequently encountered by the respondent. Similar\r\n information was obtained for each additional crime type mentioned by\r\n the respondent, in descending order of frequency.

Multiplying these two figures would yield an estimate of the\r\n annual financial cost of mental health care for crime victims. For\r\n this survey, mental health professionals were sampled from eight\r\n professional organizations and were asked questions about their\r\n clients during 1991. Respondents were instructed to count only those\r\n clients whose primary reason for being treated was because they were\r\n previously crime victims, regardless of whether the criminal\r\n victimization was the presenting issue at the time the client was\r\n first treated. Interviews were structured to first elicit information\r\n about the number of victims served for each type of crime. Respondents\r\n were then asked for details about the type and length of treatment for\r\n the crime type most frequently encountered by the respondent. Similar\r\n information was obtained for each additional crime type mentioned by\r\n the respondent, in descending order of frequency. Variables include\r\nthe number of adults, youths, and children served",

Two programs were\r\nin New York State: Substance Abuse Intervention Division (SAID) and\r\nNew Beginnings. The project was aimed at assessing program completion\r\nrates as well as 12-month post-release recidivism for program\r\nparticipants versus matched controls. Background information obtained\r\nabout the participating offenders includes sex, race, age, education,\r\nmarital status, and employment status, as well as history of drug use,\r\nprevious drug treatment, mental illness, inpatient/outpatient\r\nepisodes, and offenses and sentencing. Additional data cover program\r\nlocation, dates of release from the program and from jail, type of\r\nprogram termination, type of residence upon release, and anticipated\r\npost-custody treatment. Information on each conviction/disposition was\r\nobtained through state criminal information systems, and state-level\r\ncriminal history data (rap sheets) were collected for both the\r\ntreatment and comparison groups. The unit of analysis is arrest\r\nevents.",

Two programs were\r\nin New York State: Substance Abuse Intervention Division (SAID) and\r\nNew Beginnings. The project was aimed at assessing program completion\r\nrates as well as 12-month post-release recidivism for program\r\nparticipants versus matched controls. Background information obtained\r\nabout the participating offenders includes sex, race, age, education,\r\nmarital status, and employment status, as well as history of drug use,\r\nprevious drug treatment, mental illness, inpatient/outpatient\r\nepisodes, and offenses and sentencing. Additional data cover program\r\nlocation, dates of release from the program and from jail, type of\r\nprogram termination, type of residence upon release, and anticipated\r\npost-custody treatment. Information on each conviction/disposition was\r\nobtained through state criminal information systems, and state-level\r\ncriminal history data (rap sheets) were collected for both the\r\ntreatment and comparison groups. The unit of analysis is arrest\r\nevents.",

The third element of the study's secondary analysis research design involved using the identified variables to reproduce the multivariate empirical findings about the effects of sanctions, stakes, and social context on repeat offending. These findings were presented in a series of tables in the four Wooldredge and Thistlethwaite publications.\r\nAfter numerous iterations of reading reports and documentation and exploring alternative measures and methods, researchers produced a report detailing their ability to reproduce Wooldredge and Thistlethwaite's descriptive measures.\r\nThis study's design called for using explicit criteria for determining the extent to which Wooldredge and Thistlethwaite's findings could be reproduced. Researchers developed and applied three criteria for making that determination. The first was a simple comparison of the regression coefficients and standard errors. The second criterion was a determination of whether the reproduced results conformed to the direction and statistical significance levels of the original analyses. The third criterion was to apply a statistical test to assess the significance of any differences in the sizes of the original and the reproduced coefficients.\r\nThe data archived by Wooldredge provided seven dichotomous measures of criminal sanctions (no charges filed, dismissed, acquitted, a treatment program, probation only, jail only, and a combination of probation and jail). Part of the design of this study was to go beyond reproducing Wooldredge and Thistlethwaite's approaches and to reformulate the available measures of criminal sanctions to more directly test the prosecution, conviction, and sentence severity hypotheses. The researchers produced these tests by constructing three new measures of criminal sanctions (prosecution, conviction, and sanction severity) and testing each of them in separate multivariate models.\r\nThe Part 1 (Hamilton County, Ohio, Census Tract Data) data file contains 206 cases and 35 variables.

The project focused only on those living in the communities who were capable of accurately self-reporting their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Through focus groups of adult protective services and abuse hot-line staff, questionnaire items were generated and later tested through interviews of clients of aging services in Florida. Aging services case managers screened and recruited 95 clients, aged 65 and older, with 25 clients who had reports of mistreatment within the hotline database, and 70 comparison clients (no reports of mistreatment).  Groups were matched by gender and age within 10 years. The interviews were conducted over an 18-month period, of which 3 interviews were  conducted in-person and 92 interviews were conducted by telephone. All interviews were conducted by trained interviewers of the research team. Twenty-six interviews were conducted in Spanish.  Interviews focused on demographics; activities of daily living; 19 possible types of elder abuse or neglect within the previous year, and, for each positive response, questions about the perpetrators and their relationship to the older adult; a description of when the mistreatment happened, how often, what the respondent did, and whether it was related to the perpetrator's anger, neglect, or carelessness.",

The primary objective of the Homicide Clearance Project was to improve homicide clearance rates by increasing investigative time through the transfer of four crime scene specialists to the homicide unit. In 2004, the Phoenix Police Department received a grant from the Bureau of Justice Assistance providing support for the assignment of four crime scene specialists directly to the department's Homicide Unit. Responsibilities of the crime scene specialists were to collect evidence at homicide scenes, prepare scene reports, develop scene diagrams, and other supportive activities. Prior to the project, homicide investigators were responsible for evidence collection, which reduced the time they could devote to investigations. The crime scene specialists were assigned to two of the four investigative squads within the homicide unit. This organizational arrangement provided for a performance evaluation of the squads with crime scene specialists (experimental squads) against the performance of the other squads (comparison squads). During the course of the evaluation, research staff coded information from all homicides that occurred during the 12-month period prior to the transfers (July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2004), referred to as the baseline period, the 2-month training period (July 1, 2004 - August 31, 2004), and a 10-month test period (September 1, 2004 - June 30, 2005). Data were collected on 404 homicide cases (Part 1), 532 homicide victims and survivors (Part 2), and 3,338 records of evidence collected at homicide scenes (Part 3). The two primary sources of information for the evaluation were investigative reports from the department's records management system, called the Police Automated Computer Entry (PACE) system, and crime laboratory reports from the crime laboratory's Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 each contain variables that measure squad type, time period, and whether six general categories of evidence were collected. Part 1 contains a total of 18 variables including number of investigators, number of patrol officers at the scene, number of witnesses, number of crime scene specialists at the scene, number of investigators collecting evidence at the scene, total number of evidence collectors, whether the case was open or closed, type of arrest, and whether the case was open or closed by arrest. Part 2 contains a total of 37 variables including victim characteristics and motives. Other variables in Part 2 include an instrumental/expressive homicide indicator, whether the case was open or closed, type of arrest, whether the case was open or closed by arrest, number of investigators, number of patrol officers at the scene, number of witnesses, and investigative time to closure. Part 3 contains a total of 46 variables including primary/secondary scene indicator, scene type, number of pieces of evidence, total time at the scene, and number of photos taken. Part 3 also includes variables that measure whether 16 specific types of evidence were found and the number of items of evidence that were collected for 13 specific evidence types.",

This research effort was aimed at providing policy makers some guidance on whether expanding this model to more drug-involved offenders is cost-beneficial.  Since data needed for providing evidence-based analysis of this issue were not readily available, micro-level data from three nationally representative sources were used to construct a 40,320 case synthetic dataset -- defined using population profiles rather than sampled observation -- that was used to estimate the benefits of going to scale in treating drug involved offenders. The principal investigators combined information from the NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH, 2003 (ICPSR 4138) and the ARRESTEE DRUG ABUSE MONITORING (ADAM) PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES, 2003 (ICPSR 4020) to estimate the likelihood of drug addiction or dependence problems and develop nationally representative prevalence estimates. They used information in the DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT OUTCOME STUDY (DATOS), 1991-1994 (ICPSR 2258) to compute expected crime reducing benefits of treating various types of drug involved offenders under four different treatment modalities. The project computed expected crime reducing benefits that were conditional on treatment modality as well as arrestee attributes and risk of drug dependence or abuse. Moreover, the principal investigators obtained estimates of crime reducing benefits for all crimes as well as select sub-types.  Variables include age, race, gender, offense, history of violence, history of treatment, co-occurring alcohol problem, criminal justice system status, geographic location, arrest history, and a total of 134 prevalence and treatment effect estimates and variances.",

As part of an evaluation of 3 new supervision practice protocols on a cohort of parolees, a total of 1,964 parolees who began supervision in Georgia between March 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007, were assigned to experimental and control groups.  Parolees in the experimental group were subjected to the new practice protocols: positive drug test resulting in a referral to treatment, job loss followed by referral to an employment program and increased contact, and chronic technical violations responded to with an administrative hearing and enrollment in a cognitive skills program. In the control sites, the parole officer's response to a parolee's violation or success was still defined by the Board's Behavior Response and Adjustment Guide (BRAG). Each parolee was tracked for a 12-month follow-up period. The research team collected data on the parolees using two Georgia Department of Corrections and Board of Pardons and Paroles agency databases: the Offender Tracking Information System (OTIS) and the Parole Field Log of Interaction Data (FLOID) database. Outcomes during a 12-month follow-up period were defined as employment, general violations of the conditions of supervision, positive drug tests, arrests for technical violations, misdemeanor and felony arrests, and revocation of parole. The dataset includes a total of 218 variables including supervision protocol variables, demographic and other parolee characteristics variables, offense and parole supervision variables, drug test results, employment activity, as well as arrests, violations, sanctions, programs, and referrals information.",

Abt Associates conducted a four-year impact evaluation of Youth Crime Watch (YCW) programs in three Florida school districts (Broward, Hillsborough, and Pinellas Counties).  School-based YCW programs implement one or more of a variety of crime prevention activities, including youth patrol, in which YCW participants patrol their school campus and report misconduct and crime. The evaluation collected both School-Level Data (Part 1) and Student-Level Data (Part 2).  The School-Level Data (Part 1) contain 9 years of data on 172 schools in the Broward, Hillsborough, and Pinellas school districts, beginning in the 1997-1998 school year and continuing through the 2005-2006 school year. A total of 103 middle schools and 69 high schools were included, yielding a total of 1,548 observations.  These data provide panel data on reported incidents of crime and violence, major disciplinary actions, and school climate data across schools and over time.  The Student-Level Data (Part 2) were collected between 2004 and 2007 and are comprised of two major components: (1) self-reported youth attitude and school activities survey data that were administered to a sample of students in middle schools in the Broward, Hillsborough, and Pinellas School Districts as part of a participant impact analysis, and (2) self-reported youth attitude and school activities survey data that were administered to a sample of YCW continuing middle school students and YCW high school students in the same three school districts as part of a process analysis.  For Part 2, a total of 3,386 completed surveys were collected by the project staff including 1,319 \"new YCW\" student surveys, 1,581 \"non-YCW\" student surveys, and 486 \"Pro\" or \"Process\" student surveys.  The 138 variables in the School-Level Data (Part 1) include Youth Crime Watch (YCW) program data, measures of crime and the level of school safety in a school, and other school characteristics. The 99 variables in the Student-Level Data (Part 2) include two groups of questions for assessing participant impact: (1) how the respondents felt about themselves, and (2) whether the respondent would report certain types of problems or crimes that they observed at the school. Part 2 also includes administrative variables and demographic/background information. Other variables in Part 2 pertain to the respondent's involvement in school-based extracurricular activities, involvement in community activities, attitudes toward school, attitudes about home environment, future education plans, attitudes toward the YCW advisor, attitudes about effects of YCW, participation in YCW, reasons for joining YCW, and reasons for remaining in YCW.",

The Student-Level Data (Part 2) were collected between 2004 and 2007 and are comprised of two major components: (1) self-reported youth attitude and school activities survey data that were administered to a sample of students in middle schools in the Broward, Hillsborough, and Pinellas School Districts as part of a participant impact analysis, and (2) self-reported youth attitude and school activities survey data that were administered to a sample of YCW continuing middle school students and YCW high school students in the same three school districts as part of a process analysis.  For Part 2, a total of 3,386 completed surveys were collected by the project staff including 1,319 \"new YCW\" student surveys, 1,581 \"non-YCW\" student surveys, and 486 \"Pro\" or \"Process\" student surveys.  The 138 variables in the School-Level Data (Part 1) include Youth Crime Watch (YCW) program data, measures of crime and the level of school safety in a school, and other school characteristics. The 99 variables in the Student-Level Data (Part 2) include two groups of questions for assessing participant impact: (1) how the respondents felt about themselves, and (2) whether the respondent would report certain types of problems or crimes that they observed at the school. Part 2 also includes administrative variables and demographic/background information. Other variables in Part 2 pertain to the respondent's involvement in school-based extracurricular activities, involvement in community activities, attitudes toward school, attitudes about home environment, future education plans, attitudes toward the YCW advisor, attitudes about effects of YCW, participation in YCW, reasons for joining YCW, and reasons for remaining in YCW.",

The research team conducted a national survey of all United States municipal police agencies that had at least 300 sworn officers and were listed in the 2007 National Directory of Law Enforcement Administrators. The survey instrument was developed based on the research team's experience in working with large personnel systems, instruments used in previous police staffing surveys, and discussions with police practitioners. The research team distributed the initial surveys on February 27, 2008. To ensure an acceptable response rate, the principal investigators developed a comprehensive nonresponse protocol, provided ample field time for departments to compile information and respond, and provided significant one-on-one technical assistance to agencies as they completed the survey. In all, the surveys were in the field for 38 weeks. Respondents were asked to consult their agency's records in order to provide information about their agency's experience with recruiting, hiring, and retaining officers for 2006 and 2007. Of the 146 departments contacted, 107 completed the survey. The police recruitment and retention survey data were supplemented with data on each jurisdiction from the American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports. The dataset contains a total of 535 variables pertaining to recruitment, hiring, union activity, compensation rates, promotion, retirement, and attrition. Many of these variables are available by rank, sex and race.",

The research team conducted a national survey of all United States municipal police agencies that had at least 300 sworn officers and were listed in the 2007 National Directory of Law Enforcement Administrators. The survey instrument was developed based on the research team's experience in working with large personnel systems, instruments used in previous police staffing surveys, and discussions with police practitioners. The research team distributed the initial surveys on February 27, 2008. To ensure an acceptable response rate, the principal investigators developed a comprehensive nonresponse protocol, provided ample field time for departments to compile information and respond, and provided significant one-on-one technical assistance to agencies as they completed the survey. In all, the surveys were in the field for 38 weeks. Respondents were asked to consult their agency's records in order to provide information about their agency's experience with recruiting, hiring, and retaining officers for 2006 and 2007. Of the 146 departments contacted, 107 completed the survey. The police recruitment and retention survey data were supplemented with data on each jurisdiction from the American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports. The dataset contains a total of 535 variables pertaining to recruitment, hiring, union activity, compensation rates, promotion, retirement, and attrition. Many of these variables are available by rank, sex and race.",

-            "description": "The Law Enforcement and Family Support program consists of multi-dimensional stress management services for law enforcement personnel within the state of Tennessee. The Tennessee Sheriffs' Association was awarded a grant to develop, demonstrate, and test innovative stress-reduction and support programs for State or local law enforcement personnel and their families. Over an 18-month period, a framework of stress-related services on a statewide basis for law enforcement personnel and their families was developed. The services cover a range of activities from on-scene defusings to group therapy for families, children, and couples. Its focus is the early recognition and provision of services, which preserves confidentiality while utilizing extensive peer support. The program implemented a model for a stress reduction program at regional law enforcement training academies and produced a text/workbook for educating new recruits and their families on stress related topics. In addition, this program incorporated a monitoring and evaluation component, which consisted of three studies, a Baseline Study, a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (C.I.S.D.) Study, and an Evaluation of C.I.S.D. Peer and Family Teams Study, all of which utilized a design that attempted to test the efficacy of services provided to law enforcement personnel and their families and are described in more detail below.\r\nBaseline Study (Dataset 1) - A baseline survey, the Tennessee Law Enforcement Officer Questionnaire, was developed and distributed to officers in a randomly selected number of departments from each of three regions: West, Middle, and East. The agencies from each region were matched based on demographics such as number of sworn officers. In addition to demographic information, participants were asked to identify their awareness of 19 services that may be offered by their agency as well as the utilization and willingness to use these services. The final section of the questionnaire asked participants to identify post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms that they may have experienced after a critical incident on the job. All law enforcement agencies in Tennessee were organized into groups based on type of agency (City, County, State). Agencies from each group were randomly selected. A summary of the data from Time 1 provides Tennessee with a baseline of the current awareness, utilization, and willingness to use services. In addition, this data provides an understanding of the number of critical incidents that law enforcement officers in Tennessee have experienced as well as the potential to which these incidences have impacted officers' perception of their performance.\r\nCritical Incident Stress Debriefing (C.I.S.D.) Study (Datasets 2 and 3) - The goal of this portion of the project was to determine the effectiveness of critical incidents stress debriefing (CISD) as a means to assist officers in dealing with the negative effects of exposure to a critical incident. To identify the effectiveness of the CISD intervention as well as the support programs in each region, information was collected from officers who participated in a debriefing at three time periods (i.e. prior to CISD, 2-weeks after CISD, 3-months after CISD). The Western region received only Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), the Eastern region received CISD, and Peer Support, and the Middle region received CISD, Peer Support, and Family Support. Participants were asked to identify what services they and their family may have used (e.g. EAP, Counseling, Family Support Team, Peer Support Team, Training Seminar). Additionally, participants were asked to identify any health problems they experienced since the incident, and lost work time as a result of the incident. A CISD Team member identified the type of critical incident that the officer experienced.\r\nEvaluation of the C.I.S.D. Peer and Family Teams Study (Dataset 4) - The goal of this section of the evaluation process was to identify the impact that the three Teams had on participants. Specifically participants' perception of the usefulness of the Teams and what was gained from their interaction with the Teams was to be measured. Initially, the Team evaluation forms were to be filled out by every individual who participated in a debriefing at the 2-week and 3-month periods. Asking participants to complete Team evaluations at these time periods would allow participants in the Middle region to have exposure to the Family Support and Peer Support Teams, and participants in the Eastern region to have exposure to a Peer Support Team. The procedure was modified so that Team evaluations were conducted at the completion of the project. The evaluation first asked the participant to identify if they had been contacted by\r\na member of a Team (CISD, Peer, Family).\r\nThe Part 1 (Baseline) data public and restricted files contain 5,425 cases and 157 variables. The Part 2 (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing) data public and restricted files contain 329 cases and 189 variables. The Part 3 (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing Matched Cases) data public and restricted files contain 236 cases and 354 variables. The Part 4 (Evaluation of CISD Peer and Family Teams) data public and restricted files contain 81 cases and 24 variables.",

The Tennessee Sheriffs' Association was awarded a grant to develop, demonstrate, and test innovative stress-reduction and support programs for State or local law enforcement personnel and their families. Over an 18-month period, a framework of stress-related services on a statewide basis for law enforcement personnel and their families was developed. The services cover a range of activities from on-scene defusings to group therapy for families, children, and couples. Its focus is the early recognition and provision of services, which preserves confidentiality while utilizing extensive peer support. The program implemented a model for a stress reduction program at regional law enforcement training academies and produced a text/workbook for educating new recruits and their families on stress related topics. In addition, this program incorporated a monitoring and evaluation component, which consisted of three studies, a Baseline Study, a Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (C.I.S.D.) Study, and an Evaluation of C.I.S.D. Peer and Family Teams Study, all of which utilized a design that attempted to test the efficacy of services provided to law enforcement personnel and their families and are described in more detail below.\r\nBaseline Study (Dataset 1) - A baseline survey, the Tennessee Law Enforcement Officer Questionnaire, was developed and distributed to officers in a randomly selected number of departments from each of three regions: West, Middle, and East. The agencies from each region were matched based on demographics such as number of sworn officers. In addition to demographic information, participants were asked to identify their awareness of 19 services that may be offered by their agency as well as the utilization and willingness to use these services. The final section of the questionnaire asked participants to identify post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms that they may have experienced after a critical incident on the job. All law enforcement agencies in Tennessee were organized into groups based on type of agency (City, County, State). Agencies from each group were randomly selected. A summary of the data from Time 1 provides Tennessee with a baseline of the current awareness, utilization, and willingness to use services. In addition, this data provides an understanding of the number of critical incidents that law enforcement officers in Tennessee have experienced as well as the potential to which these incidences have impacted officers' perception of their performance.\r\nCritical Incident Stress Debriefing (C.I.S.D.) Study (Datasets 2 and 3) - The goal of this portion of the project was to determine the effectiveness of critical incidents stress debriefing (CISD) as a means to assist officers in dealing with the negative effects of exposure to a critical incident. To identify the effectiveness of the CISD intervention as well as the support programs in each region, information was collected from officers who participated in a debriefing at three time periods (i.e. prior to CISD, 2-weeks after CISD, 3-months after CISD). The Western region received only Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), the Eastern region received CISD, and Peer Support, and the Middle region received CISD, Peer Support, and Family Support. Participants were asked to identify what services they and their family may have used (e.g. EAP, Counseling, Family Support Team, Peer Support Team, Training Seminar). Additionally, participants were asked to identify any health problems they experienced since the incident, and lost work time as a result of the incident. A CISD Team member identified the type of critical incident that the officer experienced.\r\nEvaluation of the C.I.S.D. Peer and Family Teams Study (Dataset 4) - The goal of this section of the evaluation process was to identify the impact that the three Teams had on participants. Specifically participants' perception of the usefulness of the Teams and what was gained from their interaction with the Teams was to be measured. Initially, the Team evaluation forms were to be filled out by every individual who participated in a debriefing at the 2-week and 3-month periods. Asking participants to complete Team evaluations at these time periods would allow participants in the Middle region to have exposure to the Family Support and Peer Support Teams, and participants in the Eastern region to have exposure to a Peer Support Team. The procedure was modified so that Team evaluations were conducted at the completion of the project. The evaluation first asked the participant to identify if they had been contacted by\r\na member of a Team (CISD, Peer, Family).\r\nThe Part 1 (Baseline) data public and restricted files contain 5,425 cases and 157 variables. The Part 2 (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing) data public and restricted files contain 329 cases and 189 variables. The Part 3 (Critical Incident Stress Debriefing Matched Cases) data public and restricted files contain 236 cases and 354 variables. The Part 4 (Evaluation of CISD Peer and Family Teams) data public and restricted files contain 81 cases and 24 variables.",

The main analytical strategy of this study\r\n was to determine whether clients who were appropriately matched to\r\n outpatient drug treatment were less likely to recidivate after\r\n treatment in this modality. The focus of the research was not so much\r\n on developing powerful prediction models, but rather on determining\r\n whether outpatient drug treatment was appropriate and effective for\r\n certain types of probationers. The evaluation research involved an\r\n in-depth analysis of a sample of 1,860 probationers who were sentenced\r\n between September 1991-September 1992 and referred to contracting\r\n outpatient drug treatment programs one or more times as of December\r\n 31, 1993. The following types of data were collected: (1) the New\r\n York City Department of Probation's demographic and drug use\r\n information, obtained during the presentence investigation and at\r\n intake to probation, (2) the Department of Probation's Central\r\n Placement Unit (CPU) database records for each referral made through\r\n the CPU, as well as monthly progress reports filled out by the\r\n treatment programs on each probationer admitted to drug treatment, (3)\r\n the New York State Department of Criminal Justice Statistics' data on\r\n criminal histories, and (4) probation officers' reports on whether\r\n clients were referred to treatment, the kind of treatment modality to\r\n which they were referred, and the dates of admission and\r\n discharge. Demographic and socioeconomic variables include age at\r\n first arrest and sentencing, gender, race or ethnicity, marital\r\n status, family composition, educational attainment, and employment\r\n status. Other variables include drug use history (e.g., age at which\r\n drugs were first used, if the client's family members used drugs, if\r\n the client was actively using heroin, cocaine, or alcohol at time of\r\n intake into treatment), criminal history (e.g., age at first arrest,\r\n number of arrests, types of crimes, prior convictions, and prior\r\n probation and jail sentences), and drug treatment history (e.g.,\r\n number and types of prior times in drug treatment, months since last\r\n treatment program, number of admissions to a CPU program, and number\r\nof AIDS education programs attended).",

The main analytical strategy of this study\r\n was to determine whether clients who were appropriately matched to\r\n outpatient drug treatment were less likely to recidivate after\r\n treatment in this modality. The focus of the research was not so much\r\n on developing powerful prediction models, but rather on determining\r\n whether outpatient drug treatment was appropriate and effective for\r\n certain types of probationers. The evaluation research involved an\r\n in-depth analysis of a sample of 1,860 probationers who were sentenced\r\n between September 1991-September 1992 and referred to contracting\r\n outpatient drug treatment programs one or more times as of December\r\n 31, 1993. The following types of data were collected: (1) the New\r\n York City Department of Probation's demographic and drug use\r\n information, obtained during the presentence investigation and at\r\n intake to probation, (2) the Department of Probation's Central\r\n Placement Unit (CPU) database records for each referral made through\r\n the CPU, as well as monthly progress reports filled out by the\r\n treatment programs on each probationer admitted to drug treatment, (3)\r\n the New York State Department of Criminal Justice Statistics' data on\r\n criminal histories, and (4) probation officers' reports on whether\r\n clients were referred to treatment, the kind of treatment modality to\r\n which they were referred, and the dates of admission and\r\n discharge. Demographic and socioeconomic variables include age at\r\n first arrest and sentencing, gender, race or ethnicity, marital\r\n status, family composition, educational attainment, and employment\r\n status. Other variables include drug use history (e.g., age at which\r\n drugs were first used, if the client's family members used drugs, if\r\n the client was actively using heroin, cocaine, or alcohol at time of\r\n intake into treatment), criminal history (e.g., age at first arrest,\r\n number of arrests, types of crimes, prior convictions, and prior\r\n probation and jail sentences), and drug treatment history (e.g.,\r\n number and types of prior times in drug treatment, months since last\r\n treatment program, number of admissions to a CPU program, and number\r\nof AIDS education programs attended).",

The county-wide survey of residents (Part 1) was\r\n designed to enhance the sheriff's current community policing program\r\n and to assist in the deployment of community policing officers by\r\n measuring citizens' perceptions and fear of crime, perceptions of\r\n deputies, knowledge of sheriff's services, and support for community\r\n policing. Questions in the citizen survey focused on feelings of\r\n safety in Ada County, such as perception of drugs, gangs, safety of\r\n youth, and safety at night, satisfaction with the Sheriff's Office,\r\n including ratings of the friendliness and fairness of the department\r\n and how well deputies and citizens worked together, attitudes\r\n regarding community-oriented policing, such as whether this type of\r\n policing would be a good use of resources and would reduce crime, and\r\n neighborhood problems, including how problematic auto theft,\r\n vandalism, physical decay, and excessive noise were for citizens.\r\n Other questions were asked regarding the sheriff's deputy website,\r\n including whether citizens would like the site to post current crime\r\n reports, and whether the site should have more information about the\r\n jail. Respondents were also queried about their encounters with\r\n police, including their ratings of recent services they received for\r\n traffic violations, requests for service, and visits to the jail, and\r\n familiarity with several programs, such as the inmate substance abuse\r\n program and the employee robbery prevention program. Demographic\r\n variables in the citizen survey include ethnicity, gender, level of\r\n schooling, occupation, income, age, and length of time residing in\r\n Ada County. The second survey (Part 2), created for the sheriff's\r\n deputies, used questions from the citizen survey about the Sheriff's\r\n Office service needs. Deputies were asked to respond to questions in\r\n the way they thought that citizens would answer these same questions\r\n in the citizen survey.

Cases deemed eligible for the study were\r\nproperty crimes including retail and other thefts, criminal mischief\r\nand trespass, and violent crimes including threats, harassment,\r\ndisorderly conduct, and simple assaults. A total of 140 property crime\r\ncases and 75 violent crime cases were selected for the experiment,\r\nwith two-thirds of each type randomly assigned to a diversionary\r\nconference (treatment group) and one-third of each type assigned to\r\nformal adjudication (control group). Participation in the conference\r\nwas voluntary. If either party declined or if the offender did not\r\nadmit responsibility for the offense, the case was processed through\r\nnormal criminal justice channels. Those cases constituted a second\r\ntreatment group (decline group). The Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Police\r\nDepartment and the Community Service Foundation conducted a two-year\r\nstudy on the effectiveness of police-based family group\r\nconferencing. Beginning on November 1, 1995, 64 conferences were\r\nconducted for the study. Approximately two weeks after their cases\r\nwere disposed, victims, offenders, and offenders' parents in the three\r\nexperimental groups (control, conference, decline) were surveyed by\r\nmail, in-person interviews, or telephone interviews. Those who\r\nparticipated in conferences (Parts 4, 6, and 8) received a different\r\nquestionnaire than those whose cases went through formal adjudication\r\n(Parts 5, 7, and 9), with similar questions to allow for comparison\r\nand some questions particular to the type of processing used on their\r\ncase. Disposition data on cases were collected from five district\r\nmagistrates in Bethlehem from January 1, 1993, to September 12,\r\n1997. Data on recidivism and outcomes of the control and decline group\r\ncases were obtained from (1) the Bethlehem Police Department arrest\r\ndatabase (Part 1) and (2) a database of records from the five district\r\nmagistrates serving Bethlehem, drawn from a statewide magistrate court\r\ndatabase compiled by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts\r\n(Part 2). An attitudinal and work environment survey was administered\r\nto the Bethlehem Police Department on two occasions, just before the\r\nconferencing program commenced (pre-test) and eighteen months later\r\n(post-test) (Part 3). Part 1 variables include offender age, year of\r\noffense, charge code, amounts of fine and payments, crime type,\r\noffender crime category, and disposition. Part 2 collected disposition\r\ndata on cases in the study and officers' observations on the\r\nconferences. Demographic variables include offender's age at current\r\narrest, ethnicity, and gender. Other variables include type of charge,\r\narrest, disposition, sentence, and recidivism, reason not conferenced,\r\ncurrent recorded charge class, amounts of total fines, hours of\r\ncommunity service, and conditions of sentence. Part 3 collected\r\ninformation on police attitudes and work environment before and after\r\nthe conferencing program. Variables on organizational issues include\r\nratings on communication, morale, co-workers, supervision,\r\nadministration, amenities, equipment, and promotions. Variables on\r\noperational issues include ratings on danger, victims, frustration,\r\nexternal activities, complaints, workload, and driving. In Parts 4 to\r\n9, researchers asked offenders, parents of offenders, and victims\r\nabout their perceptions of how their cases were handled by the justice\r\nsystem and the fairness of the process, their attitudes and beliefs\r\nabout the justice system, and their attitudes toward the victim and\r\noffender. Variables include whether the respondent was satisfied with\r\nthe way the justice system handled the case, if the offender was held\r\naccountable for the offense, if meeting with the victim was helpful,\r\nif the respondent was surprised by anything in the conference, if the\r\nrespondent told the victim/offender how he/she felt, if there was an\r\nopportunity to reach an agreement acceptable to all, if the\r\noffender/parents apologized, if the victim/parents had a better\r\nopinion of the offender after the conference, what the respondent's\r\nattitude toward the conference was, if the respondent would recommend a\r\nconference to others, if the offender was pressured to do all the\r\ntalking, if the offender was treated with respect, if victim\r\nparticipation was insincere, if the respondent had a better\r\nunderstanding of how the victim was affected, if the victim only\r\nwanted to be paid back, and if conferences were responsive to needs.",

Part 2 collected disposition\r\ndata on cases in the study and officers' observations on the\r\nconferences. Demographic variables include offender's age at current\r\narrest, ethnicity, and gender. Other variables include type of charge,\r\narrest, disposition, sentence, and recidivism, reason not conferenced,\r\ncurrent recorded charge class, amounts of total fines, hours of\r\ncommunity service, and conditions of sentence. Part 3 collected\r\ninformation on police attitudes and work environment before and after\r\nthe conferencing program. Variables on organizational issues include\r\nratings on communication, morale, co-workers, supervision,\r\nadministration, amenities, equipment, and promotions. Variables on\r\noperational issues include ratings on danger, victims, frustration,\r\nexternal activities, complaints, workload, and driving. In Parts 4 to\r\n9, researchers asked offenders, parents of offenders, and victims\r\nabout their perceptions of how their cases were handled by the justice\r\nsystem and the fairness of the process, their attitudes and beliefs\r\nabout the justice system, and their attitudes toward the victim and\r\noffender. Variables include whether the respondent was satisfied with\r\nthe way the justice system handled the case, if the offender was held\r\naccountable for the offense, if meeting with the victim was helpful,\r\nif the respondent was surprised by anything in the conference, if the\r\nrespondent told the victim/offender how he/she felt, if there was an\r\nopportunity to reach an agreement acceptable to all, if the\r\noffender/parents apologized, if the victim/parents had a better\r\nopinion of the offender after the conference, what the respondent's\r\nattitude toward the conference was, if the respondent would recommend a\r\nconference to others, if the offender was pressured to do all the\r\ntalking, if the offender was treated with respect, if victim\r\nparticipation was insincere, if the respondent had a better\r\nunderstanding of how the victim was affected, if the victim only\r\nwanted to be paid back, and if conferences were responsive to needs.",

-            "description": "The Children at Risk (CAR) Program was a comprehensive,\r\nneighborhood-based strategy for preventing drug use, delinquency, and\r\nother problem behaviors among high-risk youth living in severely\r\ndistressed neighborhoods. The goal of this research project was to\r\nevaluate the long-term impact of the CAR program using experimental\r\nand quasi-experimental group comparisons. Experimental comparisons of\r\nthe treatment and control groups selected within target neighborhoods\r\nexamined the impact of CAR services on individual youths and their\r\nfamilies. These services included intensive case management, family\r\nservices, mentoring, and incentives. Quasi-experimental comparisons\r\nwere needed in each city because control group youths in the CAR sites\r\nwere exposed to the effects of neighborhood interventions, such as\r\nenhanced community policing and enforcement activities and some\r\nexpanded court services, and may have taken part in some of the\r\nrecreational activities after school. CAR programs in five cities --\r\nAustin, TX, Bridgeport, CT, Memphis, TN, Seattle, WA, and Savannah, GA\r\n-- took part in this evaluation. In the CAR target areas, juveniles\r\nwere identified by case managers who contacted schools and the courts\r\nto identify youths known to be at risk. Random assignment to the\r\ntreatment or control group was made at the level of the family so that\r\nsiblings would be assigned to the same group. A quasi-experimental\r\ngroup of juveniles who met the CAR eligibility risk requirements, but\r\nlived in other severely distressed neighborhoods, was selected during\r\nthe second year of the evaluation in cities that continued intake of\r\nnew CAR participants into the second year. In these comparison\r\nneighborhoods, youths eligible for the quasi-experimental sample were\r\nidentified either by CAR staff, cooperating agencies, or the staff of\r\nthe middle schools they attended. Baseline interviews with youths and\r\ncaretakers were conducted between January 1993 and May 1994, during\r\nthe month following recruitment. The end-of-program interviews were\r\nconducted approximately two years later, between December 1994 and May\r\n1996. The follow-up interviews with youths were conducted one year\r\nafter the program period ended, between December 1995 and May\r\n1997. Once each year, records were collected from the police, courts,\r\nand schools. Part 1 provides demographic data on each youth, including\r\nage at intake, gender, ethnicity, relationship of caretaker to youth,\r\nand youth's risk factors for poor school performance, poor school\r\nbehavior, family problems, or personal problems. Additional variables\r\nprovide information on household size, including number and type of\r\nchildren in the household, and number and type of adults in the\r\nhousehold. Part 2 provides data from all three youth interviews\r\n(baseline, end-of-program, and follow-up). Questions were asked about\r\nthe youth's attitudes toward school and amount of homework,\r\nparticipation in various activities (school activities, team sports,\r\nclubs or groups, other organized activities, religious services, odd\r\njobs or household chores), curfews and bedtimes, who assisted the\r\nyouth with various tasks, attitudes about the future, seriousness of\r\nvarious problems the youth might have had over the past year and who\r\nhe or she turned to for help, number of times the youth's household\r\nhad moved, how long the youth had lived with the caretaker, various\r\ncriminal activities in the neighborhood and the youth's concerns about\r\nvictimization, opinions on various statements about the police,\r\noccasions of skipping school and why, if the youth thought he or she\r\nwould be promoted to the next grade, would graduate from high school,\r\nor would go to college, knowledge of children engaging in various\r\nproblem activities and if the youth was pressured to join them, and\r\nexperiences with and attitudes toward consumption of cigarettes,\r\nalcohol, and various drugs. Three sections of the questionnaire were\r\ncompleted by the youths. Section A asked questions about the youth's\r\nattitudes toward various statements about self, life, the home\r\nenvironment, rules, and norms. Section B asked questions about the\r\nnumber of times that various crimes had been committed against the\r\nyouth, his or her sexual activity, number of times the youth ran away\r\nfrom home, number of times he or she had committed various criminal\r\nacts, and what weapons he or she had carried. Items in Section C\r\ncovered the youth's alcohol and drug use, and participation in drug\r\nsales. Part 3 provides data from both caretaker interviews (baseline\r\nand end-of-program). Questions elicited the caretaker's assessments of\r\nthe presence of various positive and negative neighborhood\r\ncharacteristics, safety of the child in the neighborhood, attitudes\r\ntoward and interactions with the police, if the caretaker had been\r\narrested, had been on probation, or in jail, whether various crimes\r\nhad been committed against the caretaker or others in the household in\r\nthe past year, activities that the youth currently participated in,\r\ncurfews set by the caretaker, if the caretaker had visited the school\r\nfor various reasons, school performance or problems by the youth and\r\nthe youth's siblings, amount of the caretaker's involvement with\r\nactivities, clubs, and groups, the caretaker's financial, medical, and\r\npersonal problems and assistance received in the past year, if he or\r\nshe was not able to obtain help, why not, and information on the\r\ncaretaker's education, employment, income level, income sources, and\r\nwhere he or she sought medical treatment for themselves or for the\r\nyouth. Two sections of the data collection instruments were completed\r\nby the caretaker. Section A dealt with the youth's personal problems\r\nor problems with others, and the youth's friends. Additional questions\r\nfocused on the family's interactions, rules, and norms. Section B\r\nitems asked about the caretaker's alcohol and drug use, and any\r\nalcohol and drug use or criminal justice involvement by others in the\r\nhousehold older than the youth. Part 4 consists of data from schools,\r\npolice, and courts. School data include the youth's grades,\r\ngrade-point average (GPA), absentee rate, reasons for absences, and\r\nwhether the youth was promoted each school year. Data from police\r\nrecords include police contacts, detentions, violent offenses,\r\ndrug-related offenses, and arrests prior to recruitment in the CAR\r\nprogram and in Years 1-4 after recruitment, court contacts and charges\r\nprior to recruitment and in Years 1-4 after recruitment, and how the\r\ncharges were disposed.",

Three different surveys were employed to collect data for\r\n this study. First, a pilot study was conducted in which a\r\n questionnaire, designed to elicit information on work and family\r\n issues in law enforcement, was distributed to 1,800 law enforcement\r\n officers representing 21 municipal, suburban, and rural police\r\n agencies in western New York State (Part 1). Demographic information\r\n in this Work and Family Issues in Law Enforcement (WFILE)\r\n questionnaire included the age, gender, ethnicity, marital status,\r\n highest level of education, and number of years in law enforcement of\r\n each respondent. Respondents also provided information on which\r\n agency they were from, their job title, and the number of children\r\n and step-children they had. The remaining items on the WFILE\r\n questionnaire fell into one of the following categories: (1) work and\r\n family orientation, (2) work and family issues, (3) job's influence\r\n on spouse/significant other, (4) support by spouse/significant other,\r\n (5) influence of parental role on the job, (6) job's influence on\r\n relationship with children, (7) job's influence on relationships and\r\n friendships, (8) knowledge of programs to assist with work and family\r\n issues, (9) willingness to use programs to assist with work and\r\n family issues, (10) department's ability to assist officers with work\r\n and family issues, and (11) relationship with officer's\r\n partner. Second, a Police Officer Questionnaire (POQ) was developed\r\n based on the results obtained from the pilot study. The POQ was sent\r\n to over 4,400 officers in police agencies in three geographical\r\n locations: the Northeast (New York City, New York, and surrounding\r\n areas), the Midwest (Minneapolis, Minnesota, and surrounding areas),\r\n and the Southwest (Dallas, Texas, and surrounding areas) (Part\r\n 2). Respondents were asked questions measuring their health,\r\n exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, overall job stress, and the number\r\n of health-related stress symptoms experienced within the last\r\n month. Other questions from the POQ addressed issues of concern to\r\n the Police Research and Education Project -- a sister organization of\r\n the National Association of Police Organizations -- and its\r\n membership. These questions dealt with collective bargaining, the Law\r\n Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights, residency requirements, and\r\n high-speed pursuit policies and procedures. Demographic variables\r\n included gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, highest level of\r\n education, and number of years employed in law enforcement. Third, to\r\n identify the extent and nature of services that law enforcement\r\n agencies provided for officers and their family members, an Agency\r\n Questionnaire (AQ) was developed (Part 3). The AQ survey was\r\n developed based on information collected from previous research\r\n efforts, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994\r\n (Part W-Family Support, subsection 2303 [b]), and from information\r\n gained from the POQ. Data collected from the AQ consisted of whether\r\n the agency had a mission statement, provided any type of mental\r\n health service, and had a formalized psychological services\r\n unit. Respondents also provided information on the number of sworn\r\n officers in their agency and the gender of the officers. The\r\n remaining questions requested information on service providers, types\r\n of services provided, agencies' obstacles to use of services,\r\n agencies' enhancement of services, and the organizational impact of\r\nthe services.",

Three different surveys were employed to collect data for\r\n this study. First, a pilot study was conducted in which a\r\n questionnaire, designed to elicit information on work and family\r\n issues in law enforcement, was distributed to 1,800 law enforcement\r\n officers representing 21 municipal, suburban, and rural police\r\n agencies in western New York State (Part 1). Demographic information\r\n in this Work and Family Issues in Law Enforcement (WFILE)\r\n questionnaire included the age, gender, ethnicity, marital status,\r\n highest level of education, and number of years in law enforcement of\r\n each respondent. Respondents also provided information on which\r\n agency they were from, their job title, and the number of children\r\n and step-children they had. The remaining items on the WFILE\r\n questionnaire fell into one of the following categories: (1) work and\r\n family orientation, (2) work and family issues, (3) job's influence\r\n on spouse/significant other, (4) support by spouse/significant other,\r\n (5) influence of parental role on the job, (6) job's influence on\r\n relationship with children, (7) job's influence on relationships and\r\n friendships, (8) knowledge of programs to assist with work and family\r\n issues, (9) willingness to use programs to assist with work and\r\n family issues, (10) department's ability to assist officers with work\r\n and family issues, and (11) relationship with officer's\r\n partner. Second, a Police Officer Questionnaire (POQ) was developed\r\n based on the results obtained from the pilot study. The POQ was sent\r\n to over 4,400 officers in police agencies in three geographical\r\n locations: the Northeast (New York City, New York, and surrounding\r\n areas), the Midwest (Minneapolis, Minnesota, and surrounding areas),\r\n and the Southwest (Dallas, Texas, and surrounding areas) (Part\r\n 2). Respondents were asked questions measuring their health,\r\n exercise, alcohol and tobacco use, overall job stress, and the number\r\n of health-related stress symptoms experienced within the last\r\n month. Other questions from the POQ addressed issues of concern to\r\n the Police Research and Education Project -- a sister organization of\r\n the National Association of Police Organizations -- and its\r\n membership. These questions dealt with collective bargaining, the Law\r\n Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights, residency requirements, and\r\n high-speed pursuit policies and procedures. Demographic variables\r\n included gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, highest level of\r\n education, and number of years employed in law enforcement. Third, to\r\n identify the extent and nature of services that law enforcement\r\n agencies provided for officers and their family members, an Agency\r\n Questionnaire (AQ) was developed (Part 3). The AQ survey was\r\n developed based on information collected from previous research\r\n efforts, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994\r\n (Part W-Family Support, subsection 2303 [b]), and from information\r\n gained from the POQ. Data collected from the AQ consisted of whether\r\n the agency had a mission statement, provided any type of mental\r\n health service, and had a formalized psychological services\r\n unit. Respondents also provided information on the number of sworn\r\n officers in their agency and the gender of the officers. The\r\n remaining questions requested information on service providers, types\r\n of services provided, agencies' obstacles to use of services,\r\n agencies' enhancement of services, and the organizational impact of\r\nthe services.",

The study was conducted in 30 correctional\r\n institutions, 23 men's and 7 women's, in 10 states. All 23 men's\r\n institutions were the highest-security level men's prison available in\r\n each state. When women's institutions were multi-security level and\r\n housed minimum, medium, and high-security inmates, they were selected\r\n from the highest-security level housing units within the institution.\r\n A total of 564 (409 male and 155 female) inmates were interviewed. The\r\n inmates to be interviewed were selected from the general prison\r\n population using a probability sample design. Average interview length\r\n was just under an hour. The sole mode of data collection was an\r\n open-ended, semistructured inmate interview. To ensure comparability\r\n of answers, surveys were designed with each query resting on a\r\n particular concept or variable. The same interview instrument was used\r\n for both male and female inmates. Questions were asked about inmate\r\n prison history, mental health, rape, social process, domestic violence\r\n and relationships, staff, institutional factors, and perception of\r\n social roles, and demographic information. Also included are lexical\r\n responses and free list questions such as \"Why do inmates have sex\r\nwith other inmates?\"",
