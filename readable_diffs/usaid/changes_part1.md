FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.

             "description": "Smallholders in rural Mozambique are typically characterized by low agricultural productivity, which is in part caused by very low levels of input usage.  In the study area, four districts of Nampula province, farmers are generally far from towns where agricultural input providers are based and formal banking services are not available.  Lacking these services, smallholders typically face liquidity constraints during the planting season when returns to input usage are the highest.  In order to explore potential policy solutions to this challenge, the project combined training and incentives to use mobile money technology alongside targeted input marketing visits to promote formal saving strategies and increase take-up of basic inputs, primarily seeds, and fertilizer.   The goal of the pilot project was to determine whether combining group-level trainings in mobile money technology with targeted direct marketing could increase input usage, and consequently boost agricultural productivity.  In collaboration with Vodacom, IFPRI organized a series of trainings, first at the individual level with farm group leaders carried out in Nampula city in June 2014. This was followed by group trainings at local sites to which all farm group members were invited in July-August 2014.  Input marketing visits were carried out by a local input provider, IKURU from October 2014-January 2015.  This dataset is a baseline survey conducted in October 2014-January 2015 in which a sample of households (irrespective of whether a member attained training) were interviewed.

Whether it's getting working capital to promising entrepreneurs or input financing to small farmers, DCA seeks to prove the commercial viability of underserved markets so that lending and investment continues long after we exit. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) uses partial credit guarantees to mobilize local financing in developing countries. Guarantee agreements encourage private lenders to extend financing to underserved borrowers in new sectors and regions. By opening up local channels of financing, USAID is empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries at a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. This USAID dataset shows the partial credit guarantees that USAID has issued since the development credit authority program was founded in 1999. The spreadsheet reflects the full facility size of each guarantee, how much was lent under the guarantee, the status of the guarantee (i.e., active or expired), how much in claims the bank submitted due to losses it incurred for loans placed under the guarantee, and how many loans were placed under coverage of the guarantee. The data also shows the sector and country for each guarantee.",

The study covers general demographics, workforce trends, firm performance, access to finance, processes and networks, and the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis.  The survey consists of 86 questions in a double sampling design with stratification. The data gathers representative information for all MSEs operating in the governorates of Amman (excluding the Greater AmmanMunicipality), Zarqa, Irbid, Karak, Tafilah, and Aqaba (excluding the ASEZA free zone). Although the study is not intended to be national in scope, the target population of the six areas collectively capture 60% of the kingdom?s population.",

(See the individual entries to retrieve data for the country surveys.) With a focus on smallholder farmers, particularly women, Feed the Future supports partner countries in developing their agriculture sectors to spur economic growth that increases incomes and reduces hunger, poverty and undernutrition. Focus countries in the Feed the Future initiative administer baseline surveys to: establish the starting point for indicators to be used for program monitoring and evaluation, reveal information about the nature, magnitude and severity of problems to be addressed, serve as the basis for determining appropriate amounts of intervention, and determine targets for selected indicators of program progress.",

A community survey supplements the BIHS data to provide information on area-specific contextual factors. The BIHS covers 6500 households in 325 primary sampling units. The sample is statistically representative at following levels: (a) nationally representative of rural Bangladesh; (b) representative of rural areas of each of the seven administrative divisions of the country: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet; and (c) representative of the Feed the Future (FTF) zone of influence.

             "description": "Feed the Future monitors its performance in part by periodic assessments of a number of standardized indicators. These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI).  The northern Kenya ZOI is comprised of five counties: Marsabit, Garissa, Isiolo, Wajir, and Turkana.  Of these, only three counties (Marsabit, Isiolo, and Turkana) were included in the baseline survey. Garissa and Wajir were inaccessible during the baseline, because of security issues. Feed the Future REGAL-IR programming covers all five counties of the ZOI, while REGAL-AG covers Marsabit and Isiolo. Differences in the values of indicators can be compared by the intensity of the program (REGAL-IR only versus REGAL-IR plus REGAL-AG) in the REGAL IE report.  Kimetrica, Westat?s subcontractor in northern Kenya, interviewed eligible respondents in a total of 1,837 households in nine counties (Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana, Wajir, Baringo, Mandera, Samburu, and Tana River). Data collection took place from 14 May to 13 June 2015. The sample is large enough to measure differences among intensity levels of REGAL and humanitarian assistance (HA) programming for the IE, as well as provide point estimates for Feed the Future indicators at the ZOI level. This interim assessment uses data from 1,193 households in the five counties of the ZOI (Garissa, Isiolo, Marsabit, Turkana, and Wajir).  The report of the survey including the complete questionnaire can be found in the reference PA00MNZB.pdf.  Versions of the dataset in SAS, SPSS and STATA are available on request by sending an email to opendata@usaid.gov.",

These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI).  The Malawi ZOI interim assessment was conducted by FTF FEEDBACK in conjunction with its data collection partner, the National Statistical Office of Malawi (NSO), in the rural areas of the ZOI districts of Dedza, Lilongwe, Mangochi, Mchinji, and Ntcheu.  FTF FEEDBACK and NSO interviewed 813 households and ICF International and CARD interviewed 208 households. A total of 1,021 households were interviewed, which provided data for the target sample size of 1,007 households and ensured the sample is representative of the seven districts covered in the interim assessment.  The report of the survey including the commplete questionnaire can be found in the reference pa00mjmr.pdf.

These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI).  The objective of the Nepal Feed the Future program is to maximize the number of Nepalis lifted out of poverty and increase the number of children and women with improved nutritional status. This first interim assessment will provide the U.S. Government (USG) interagency partners, USAID BFS, USAID Missions, host country governments, and development partners with information about short-term progress of the ZOI indicators. The assessment is designed for use as a monitoring tool, and as such provides point estimates of the indicators with an acceptable level of statistical precision.  For the interim survey, the FTF FEEDBACK team interviewed a total of 880 households in the ZOI. These households were spread across 44 clusters in the targeted districts, with a sample consisting of 20 households per cluster.  The report of the survey including the complete questionnaire can be found in the reference pa00mm3r.pdf.  Versions of the dataset in SAS, SPSS and STATA are available on request by sending an email to opendata@usaid.gov.",

This particular dataset contains the data from the first interim assessment of Feed the Future?s population-based indicators for the ZOI in Rwanda. In Rwanda, the ZOI covers the entire country excluding Kigali, encompassing rural, periurban and urban areas in 27 districts out of a total of 30.  The report of the survey including the entire questionnaire can be found in the reference PA00MHSW.pdf.

             "description": "Feed the Future monitors its performance in part by periodic assessments of a number of standardized indicators. These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI).  This particular dataset contains the data from the first interim assessment of Feed the Future?s population-based indicators for the ZOI in Uganda. The ZOI comprises 38 districts distributed across eight regions: Central 1, Central 2, East Central, Mid-Eastern, North, Southwest, West Nile and Western. The regions were further combined into four strata in survey design: Central 1/2, East Central/Mid-Eastern, North, and Southwest/West Nile/Western.  Sampling was based on a two-stage design, with stratification by region and urban/rural. In the first stage, enumeration areas (EAs) were selected from the 2014 national census sampling frame in 38 districts with probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. EAs with total number of households less than 80 in the frame were combined with one or two adjacent EAs to form a larger cluster for selection. Forty-two clusters were selected with 60 EAs within these clusters. Twenty households within each selected cluster were selected randomly from a list of eligible households in the second stage. The assessment is designed for use as a monitoring tool, and as such provides point estimates of the indicators with an acceptable level of statistical precision.  However, Feed the Future ZOI sample calculations are not designed to support conclusions of causality or program attribution, nor is the interim assessment designed to measure change from the baseline.  The report of the survey including the complete questionnaire can be found in the reference pa00mfbj.pdf.  Versions of the dataset in SAS, SPSS and STATA are available on request by sending an email to opendata@usaid.gov.",

             "description": "Feed the Future monitors its performance in part by periodic assessments of a number of standardized indicators. These indicators reflect data collected through population-based surveys (PBS) in the geographic areas targeted by Feed the Future interventions, known as the Feed the Future Zones of Influence (ZOI).  The Zambia interim ZOI survey covers only the rural and peri-urban population in the five districts, which reflects the Rural Agricultural Livelihoods Survey (RALS) sample frame.  Classification of rural and peri-urban standard enumeration areas (EAs) draws on information from Zambia?s 2000 Census of Population and Housing, the approach established for Zambia Post Harvest Surveys (PHS), and the RALS sample frame. Agricultural households are those reporting any crop production, livestock production, poultry production, or fish farming; rural EAs are those that include at least 30 agricultural households; and peri-urban EAs are urban EAs with at least 70 percent of their households classified as agricultural. The ZOI population that resides in the urban areas excluded from the Zambia ZOI survey represents approximately 10 percent of the total ZOI population. The Zambia ZOI interim survey was conducted by Feed the Future FEEDBACK (FTF FEEDBACK) in conjunction with its data collection partner, Palm Associates Limited. Fieldwork for the ZOI interim survey took place from November 25 to December 21, 2015.  The report of the survey including the complete questionnaire can be found in the reference PA00MJMB.pdf.  Versions of the dataset in SAS, SPSS and STATA are available on request by sending an email to opendata@usaid.gov.",

Feed the Future is known for its rigorous monitoring, evaluation and learning system, which measures the results of our whole-of-government efforts. The Global Food Security Act sparked an update to this system to align it with our new strategy and  strengthen how we are learning, adapting to challenges, and effectively tracking our progress. The revision of our monitoring, evaluation and learning system included an update to our performance indicators to align with our new results framework.  For 2018 and 2019, we will continue to report on the original set of Feed the Future indicators, while collecting targets and baseline data for Feed the Future\udc92s updated indicators.

             "description": "This baseline survey serves as the first stage of an impact evaluation designed to determine the impact of the project's interventions on households? resilience to shocks and, thus, on well-being outcomes, including poverty, food security, and children?s nutritional status.  The survey was administered from November 19 to December 24, 2013 in two of the three sub-regions within the PRIME project?s area of implementation, Borena and Jijiga. The evaluation was designed to focus on a sub-set of participants in two focus areas rather than the entire target population to allow for a closer measurement of a smaller group of households, saving costs and producing more valuable insights. The evaluation design team was also encouraged by USAID/Ethiopia to select these areas to carry out a dual-focused impact evaluation, where one dimension would focus on natural resource management (in Borena) and the second would focus on improvements in livelihoods and market-enabling conditions (in Jijiga).  The baseline survey has two quantitative components?a household survey and a community survey.  Sample selection was based on a two-stage, stratified random sampling design.  In stage one of sample selection, sample enumeration areas were selected within each stratum using probability proportional to size sampling. In the second stage, households within each enumeration area were selected randomly from household listings.  Note that the planned empirical technique for the impact evaluation necessitated that within each of the two study areas, one-third of the households be selected from the High Intensity intervention stratum and two-thirds from the Low Intensity intervention stratum.  The questionnaire can be found in pb-aac-190.pdf and the main report can be found in pb-aac-189.pdf in the references.  Versions of the dataset in SAS, SPSS and STATA are available on request by sending an email to opendata@usaid.gov.",

Cambodia-HARVEST set strategic goals to improve food security, strengthen natural resource management and resilience to climate change, and increase the capacity of the public and private sectors and civil society to support agricultural competitiveness.  Implemented in four targeted provinces of Cambodia -- Kampong Thom, Siem Reap, Pursat, and Battambang -- Cambodia-HARVEST had five major components: Agribusiness Value Chains; Aquaculture and Fisheries; Natural Resource Management; Biodiversity, and Climate Change, Social Inclusion, Business Development Services; and Capacity Development.  Cambodia-Harvest worked with local partners and government to initiate policy reforms and eliminate obstacles to development.  This data asset enables the evaluation of the program.  It is comprised of a baseline, endline and community level survey.  A report on the baseline survey can be found in the reference pa00k123.pdf",

A hyperspectral spectrometer was used to take leaf level reflectance data weekly on all plots from late vegetative stages to maturity. In addition, other typical agronomic traits were recorded: grain yield, plant height, ear height, root and stalk lodging, etc. This dataset also contains vegetation indices that have already been calculated for each plot on each sampling date. The data was used to see how traits changed in CIMMYT hybrids over time.",

This platform is intended to be used as a plug-and-play peripheral that reuses existing hardware in the mobile device, and does not require an external battery, thereby improving upon its convenience and portability. Experimental data using a passive circuit network to mimic an electrochemical cell demonstrate that the device performs comparable to laboratory grade instrumentation with 0.3% and 0.5\udcb0 magnitude and phase error, respectively, over a 17 Hz-17 kHz frequency range. The measured power consumption is 2.5 mW with a dynamic range of 60 dB.

The MISTI dataset contains five semi-annual iterations or 'waves' of surveys conducted by Management Systems International (MSI) from September 2012 through November 2014 to assess the impact of USAID projects on stability and resilience at the district and village levels in Afghanistan.  The main objective of the stabilization projects covered by the surveys, including the Stability in Key Areas (SIKA) programs, the Community Cohesion Initiative (CCI), the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program II, and the Kandahar Food Zone (KFZ), was to promote good governance and stability by building connections between government leaders and local communities.  USAID's efforts in these projects included training local government officials on how to manage projects, producing manuals that informed the public on how to tap into government services, and providing support for small-scale public works projects.  MISTI data analysis included village demographic characteristics, violent incident counts, stabilization and the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) project activities.  Perception indicators from interviews of 190,264 people conducted in 5,093 villages across 130 districts and 23 provinces in Afghanistan, has already yielded important insights that will inform U.S. and Afghan Government policy and practice related to transition. You can find all the MISTI Impact Evaluation reports on USAID?s Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) by clicking on the references below.  And, you can find a more complete description of the project by looking at the Fact Sheet included in that same list of references. Please note, an issue arose with the SPSS version of the survey file that had been posted here previously.  That file is currently being reconstituted and will be restored an the near future.",

At the start, MISTI compiled a baseline stabilization and impact evaluation and survey. For the five waves of surveys, each of which was conducted over several months, a total of 190,264 individual interviews were undertaken in 5,093 different villages across 130 districts of the 23 provinces where stabilization initiatives were being implemented or considered. These data were compiled into one file to facilitate easy access for international development practitioners, researchers and other interested parties in accordance with the USAID?s Open Data Policy. As part of this process, village names and locations have been replaced with unique village identifiers to ensure the safety of Afghan stakeholders. This preserves a researcher's ability to access granular data and see trends at the village-level, but prevents data consumers from attributing responses to a named Afghan village.  The datasets supplied here are in CSV format. These data were analyzed for the MISTI impact evaluation of USAID stabilization programming in Afghanistan, 2012-2014.  USAID/Afghanistan?s MISTI ranks as the largest and most comprehensive trends analysis and impact evaluation of stabilization interventions that the U.S. Government has ever undertaken.

USAID Forward improved the way that the Agency delivers foreign assistance by embracing new partnerships, investing in the catalytic role of innovation, and demanding a renewed focus on results.  In 2017, the Agency determined that the work advanced under USAID Forward had largely been institutionalized.  On this site, you will find the FY 2012-2016 data related to USAID Forward's three main areas of focus: 1) Deliver results on a meaningful scale through a strengthened USAID, 2) Promote sustainable development through high-impact partnerships and local solutions, and 3) Identify and scale up innovative, breakthrough solutions to intractable development challenges.  As of October 2017, we are no longer updating information, including collecting indicators, on this legacy effort.",

Data for the WEAI will be collected every two years in all 19 countries, and baselines were collected in 2011 and 2012. USAID and partners will conduct data analyses to understand the relationships among empowerment, livelihoods, and food security, as well as relationships among the various components of the index. Feed the Future will also use the WEAI for impact evaluations of distinct projects to examine the effectiveness of different approaches and how they impact women and men.

The overall goal of the campaign was to contribute to the reduction of new HIV infections in Zambia by addressing key drivers of transmission, mainly low and inconsistent condom use, multiple concurrent partnerships, and low uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission services.  The campaign also included messages on uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision.",

             "description": "Indonesia has monitored behaviours that carry a high risk for HIV infection in groups most likely to be affected since 1996. The behavioural sentinel surveillance was originally carried out by the University of Indonesia, with the support of  Family Health International under a grant provided by USAID. In 2002, the system was taken over by a team led by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Surveys were implemented by the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics with the help of NGOs and with technical support from Family Health International, and funded by USAID under a memorandum of understanding which explicitly allows data to be made available for the purposes of planning and evaluating HIV-related interventions. Two rounds of surveillance were carried out under this MOU. In 2002/2003, the team covered only female sex workers and groups of highly mobile men (10 cities). Surveys among male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors were carried out by University of Indonesia/FHI. In 2004, the government team covered all groups, with data from 15 cities. Variables cover demographic details, sexual and drug taking behaviour, knowledge of HIV, risk perception, contact with HIV prevention and STI care services and use of services. Users particularly interested in data from other groups, including male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors may contact the owner of this Dataverse. However these data sets have not been so well documented, and some of the documentation is only available in Indonesian. This dataset can be accessed on the Harvard Dataverse by going to https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/pisani. ",

Two components of the current version of OPS Master are the OPS Master Tool and Integrated Financial Planning (IFP).  IFP is a formal standardized Mission business process that provides information about implementation progress, funding plans, pipelines, and procurement plans for all Mission-managed resources. This information is used in quarterly financial review meetings. The initial system was based off of Excel spreadsheets, but OPS Master 3 upgrades those to a web-based data entry interface for a more standard and shareable format.",

VCS facilitates data interchange between TraiNet and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). VCS performs three functions: First, it implements a process to verify data from TraiNet. Second, it translates TraiNet data to the format required by SEVIS and manages its transmission. Lastly, it provides approval management of requests for applications as they move through the workflow process. VCS holds data regarding foreign nationals who receive instruction funded by USAID, whose training will take place in the United States, and to request a J-1 visa for travel to the United States.",

The design of the system will take into account and be compatible with other existing data collection systems already in place in Jordan (as researched by the Contractor, e.g. systems maintained by the government of Jordan, NGOs or other donors) and provide solutions that make use of that data to the extent possible to avoid duplication and an additional work burden. It will reduce data collection costs, save time and improve the accuracy of reporting, and provide a flexible and easy-to-use reporting capability enabling USAID/Jordan to respond to a wide variety of reporting requirements and ad-hoc requests. It will allow users to track activity-based information, such as baselines, targets, outputs and outcomes for the purpose of conducting performance-driven reviews.",

EODS provides an automated on-boarding process that focuses on pre-employment on-boarding benefits forms completion and data collection and delivery of new hire information to prospective federal employee. The system pulls position data from HR Connect . The public-facing Internet portion allows EODS applicants to access their information via a secure connection across the internet. The intranet portion allows HR Specialists to administer and track applicants' benefits package completion and the interconnection between EODS and HR Connect.  CareerLauncher is the entry-on-duty system (EODS) implemented in July 2012 to help streamline the onboarding process and provide a much better experience for new hires entering the Agency. This system greatly reduces the manual effort for new hires by providing the package of standard forms that a new hire typically completes by hand in electronic form via the internet, with some prefilled information provided by the applicant from Monster CareerConnector. In addition, the system greatly reduces the data entry on the HR professional's part by automatically feeding the new hire information to the USAID HR personnel system.",

Project Managers can input investment information into the system and use it to produce reports such as OMB-53s and OMB-300s. It can also support project management by providing information on performance-based management (PBM), earned value management (EVM), and enterprise project management (EPM).
