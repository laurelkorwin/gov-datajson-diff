Data for the WEAI will be collected every two years in all 19 countries, and baselines were collected in 2011 and 2012. USAID and partners will conduct data analyses to understand the relationships among empowerment, livelihoods, and food security, as well as relationships among the various components of the index.

             "description": "Indonesia has monitored behaviours that carry a high risk for HIV infection in groups most likely to be affected since 1996. The behavioural sentinel surveillance was originally carried out by the University of Indonesia, with the support of  Family Health International under a grant provided by USAID. In 2002, the system was taken over by a team led by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Surveys were implemented by the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics with the help of NGOs and with technical support from Family Health International, and funded by USAID under a memorandum of understanding which explicitly allows data to be made available for the purposes of planning and evaluating HIV-related interventions. Two rounds of surveillance were carried out under this MOU. In 2002/2003, the team covered only female sex workers and groups of highly mobile men (10 cities). Surveys among male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors were carried out by University of Indonesia/FHI. In 2004, the government team covered all groups, with data from 15 cities. Variables cover demographic details, sexual and drug taking behaviour, knowledge of HIV, risk perception, contact with HIV prevention and STI care services and use of services. Users particularly interested in data from other groups, including male and transgender sex workers, gay men and drug injectors may contact the owner of this Dataverse. However these data sets have not been so well documented, and some of the documentation is only available in Indonesian. This dataset can be accessed on the Harvard Dataverse by going to https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/pisani. ",

VCS facilitates data interchange between TraiNet and Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). VCS performs three functions: First, it implements a process to verify data from TraiNet. Second, it translates TraiNet data to the format required by SEVIS and manages its transmission. Lastly, it provides approval management of requests for applications as they move through the workflow process. VCS holds data regarding foreign nationals who receive instruction funded by USAID, whose training will take place in the United States, and to request a J-1 visa for travel to the United States.",

This new system will be developed as a part of the USAID/Jordan Monitoring and Evaluation Support Project (USAID MESP) (SOL-278-13-000018) Procurement which is currently in-process as of June 1, 2013. The design of the system will take into account and be compatible with other existing data collection systems already in place in Jordan (as researched by the Contractor, e.g. systems maintained by the government of Jordan, NGOs or other donors) and provide solutions that make use of that data to the extent possible to avoid duplication and an additional work burden. It will reduce data collection costs, save time and improve the accuracy of reporting, and provide a flexible and easy-to-use reporting capability enabling USAID/Jordan to respond to a wide variety of reporting requirements and ad-hoc requests. It will allow users to track activity-based information, such as baselines, targets, outputs and outcomes for the purpose of conducting performance-driven reviews.",

It is established and maintained by the USAID Liberia Monitoring and Evaluation Program (L-MEP) and is actively online through this portal with a username and password access. In addition to quantitative data relating to indicators, the PIDS permits the uploading, filing, and retrieval of qualitative data that can be incorporated into the semi-annual Performance Indicator Reference Sheet (PIRS) and the annual Performance Plan and Report (PPR).  In this manner, success stories and other informational formats can operate within this environment.  Individual IPs can manage specific data needs pertinent to their projects.  Via its dashboard function, USAID and IP managers can see graphical analyses of how an IP, a project activity, or a more general program is doing for a particular time frame.",

EODS provides an automated on-boarding process that focuses on pre-employment on-boarding benefits forms completion and data collection and delivery of new hire information to prospective federal employee. The system pulls position data from HR Connect . The public-facing Internet portion allows EODS applicants to access their information via a secure connection across the internet. The intranet portion allows HR Specialists to administer and track applicants' benefits package completion and the interconnection between EODS and HR Connect.  CareerLauncher is the entry-on-duty system (EODS) implemented in July 2012 to help streamline the onboarding process and provide a much better experience for new hires entering the Agency. This system greatly reduces the manual effort for new hires by providing the package of standard forms that a new hire typically completes by hand in electronic form via the internet, with some prefilled information provided by the applicant from Monster CareerConnector. In addition, the system greatly reduces the data entry on the HR professional's part by automatically feeding the new hire information to the USAID HR personnel system.",

It is a commercially available, off-the-shelf (COTS) package that supports budgeting, risk, and capital planning and investment control (CPIC) processes. Project Managers can input investment information into the system and use it to produce reports such as OMB-53s and OMB-300s. It can also support project management by providing information on performance-based management (PBM), earned value management (EVM), and enterprise project management (EPM). WorkLenz is currently being piloted as the T&A project's performance-based management system (PBMS).",
