Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The primary change appears to be a reorganization of JSON object properties, making them alphabetically ordered
- No content is being fundamentally changed or removed
- The structure of the data remains the same, but properties are reordered consistently across multiple similar objects
- Each object represents a survey dataset with metadata about its collection and distribution

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No systematic changes in terminology or vocabulary
- Consistent use of terms across objects:
  - "AmericasBarometer" 
  - "Latin America Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)"
  - Standard metadata fields like "accessLevel", "bureauCode", "distribution", etc.
- Rights and license text remains identical across objects

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within each object are reordered alphabetically
- Common pattern of reorganization:
  - Basic metadata (accessLevel, bureauCode, etc.) moved to top
  - Distribution details grouped together
  - Identifiers and references grouped
  - Rights and spatial information moved to end
- The hierarchical structure remains unchanged
- No changes to the actual data content or relationships between objects

The main change appears to be a standardization of property ordering within the JSON objects, likely for consistency and readability. This is a formatting change rather than a content change, making the structure more uniform across all survey dataset entries while preserving all the original information.
