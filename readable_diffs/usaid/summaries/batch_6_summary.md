Based on the git diff changes, here's my analysis:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata fields within dataset entries
- Movement of fields like "describedBy" and "describedByType" from one location to another
- Addition of new fields like "identifier", "keyword", "landingPage", "language", etc. to some entries
- Standardization of field ordering across entries

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Field Movements:
- "describedBy" and "describedByType" fields are consistently moved from being direct properties of distribution items to being properties of the parent object
- Fields like "USAIDawardNumber", "USAIDinitiative", and "USAIDsubmittingOrganization" are moved to the top of entries

Field Additions:
- New standardized fields added to entries including:
  - "identifier"
  - "keyword" 
  - "landingPage"
  - "language"
  - "license"
  - "programCode"
  - "spatial" (where applicable)

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:

- More consistent ordering of fields across all dataset entries
- Grouping of related fields together (e.g., all USAID-specific fields)
- Distribution arrays are more consistently structured with standardized field ordering
- Better organization of metadata with core fields appearing in a more standardized order
- Movement toward a more normalized data structure with consistent field placement and grouping

The changes appear focused on standardizing the structure and organization of the metadata while maintaining the same core information. This suggests an effort to improve consistency and machine-readability of the dataset descriptions.
