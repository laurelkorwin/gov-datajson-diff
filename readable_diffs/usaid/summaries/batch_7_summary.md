Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reordering of JSON object properties across multiple dataset entries
- No substantial content changes - mostly reorganization of existing data
- Consistent standardization of property ordering within objects
- Some metadata field additions (e.g., modified dates, identifiers)

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No systematic terminology changes observed
- Consistent preservation of existing terms and descriptions
- Property names remain unchanged (e.g., "accessLevel", "distribution", "keyword", etc.)
- License and rights statements maintained consistently

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within JSON objects are being alphabetically ordered
- Common pattern of moving properties like:
  - identifier
  - keyword
  - language
  - license
  - modified
  - programCode
  - publisher
  To standardized positions within objects

- Distribution arrays and their contained objects are being kept together
- Metadata fields like USAIDawardNumber and USAIDsubmittingOrganization are being grouped together
- Contact information blocks remain intact but may be repositioned

The primary change appears to be a systematic reorganization of the JSON structure to follow a more consistent property ordering, rather than any substantive changes to the actual content or terminology. This type of reorganization typically improves readability and maintainability of the data structure while preserving all the original information.
