Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes show a consistent restructuring of JSON objects containing information about various USAID systems and databases
- The primary change is in the ordering of properties within each object, moving from a somewhat random order to a more standardized alphabetical ordering
- No content appears to be added or removed - the changes are purely organizational

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No actual terminology changes are present - the same terms and descriptions are maintained throughout
- The values for properties like "accessLevel", "rights", "license" remain consistent
- Property names remain unchanged, just reordered

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties within each JSON object are reordered to follow a consistent alphabetical pattern:
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - identifier
  - keyword
  - language
  - license
  - modified
  - programCode
  - publisher
  - rights
  - systemOfRecords (where applicable)
  - title

- The reordering appears to be applied consistently across all objects in the dataset
- This change improves readability and maintainability by establishing a predictable property order
- No changes to the actual data structure or nesting - just the order of properties within each object

The changes appear to be part of a code cleanup or standardization effort, focusing on consistent property ordering rather than any content modifications.
