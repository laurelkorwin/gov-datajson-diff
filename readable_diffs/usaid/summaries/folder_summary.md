Based on analyzing these batch summaries, here is a comprehensive synthesis of the git diff changes in the USAID folder:

1. Major Themes and Patterns:
- Primary change was a systematic reorganization of JSON/metadata properties across multiple dataset entries
- Focus on standardization and consistency in structure
- No substantive content modifications - changes were purely organizational
- Affected multiple AmericasBarometer survey datasets and USAID systems/databases
- Preservation of all original information while improving structure

2. Terminology and Language:
Consistent Elements:
- No actual terminology changes or replacements
- Maintained standard terms like "AmericasBarometer" and "Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)"
- Preserved existing rights statements and license text
- Consistent use of language codes (en-US, es)

Field Standardization:
- USAID-specific fields grouped together (USAIDawardNumber, USAIDinitiative, USAIDsubmittingOrganization)
- Standard metadata fields maintained (accessLevel, bureauCode, distribution, etc.)
- Consistent keyword and reference formatting

3. Structural Modifications:
Primary Changes:
- Alphabetical reordering of properties within JSON objects
- Standardized field ordering across all dataset entries
- Consolidation of related fields (e.g., describedBy/describedByType with distribution objects)

Organizational Pattern:
1. USAID-specific fields (top)
2. Basic metadata (accessLevel, bureauCode, etc.)
3. Distribution details
4. Identifiers and references
5. Rights and spatial information (end)

The overall change pattern suggests a systematic effort to improve data structure consistency and maintainability while preserving all original content and relationships.
