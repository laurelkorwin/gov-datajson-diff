Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reordering of metadata fields within dataset entries
- No substantive content changes - mostly structural reorganization
- Consistent reordering of fields like accessLevel, license, rights, etc.
- Movement of fields to standardize their position across all dataset entries

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No changes to actual terminology or wording
- Field names remain consistent throughout
- No systematic replacements or modifications of terms
- Descriptions and titles remain unchanged

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Major reorganization of field order within dataset entries
- Fields are now organized in a more consistent alphabetical order
- Common pattern of moving fields like:
  - accessLevel to beginning
  - license and rights fields grouped together
  - language fields moved to consistent position
  - publisher info moved toward end
  - title moved to end of entries
- Metadata structure standardized across all dataset entries
- No changes to the actual content or values within fields

The primary change appears to be a systematic reorganization of metadata fields to follow a more consistent ordering pattern across all dataset entries, without modifying any of the actual content or values within those fields. This looks like a formatting/standardization update rather than a content update.
