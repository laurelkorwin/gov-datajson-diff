Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes primarily involve restructuring and reorganizing metadata for various VA datasets
- Most modifications are related to standardizing the format and order of JSON properties
- No significant content changes to the actual dataset descriptions or core metadata values

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent property ordering: The changes standardize the order of properties, typically starting with "@type" and "accessLevel"
- No systematic changes to terminology or vocabulary
- Property names and values remain the same, just reordered
- Metadata structure is being normalized across dataset entries

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties are being reordered in a consistent pattern across all dataset entries
- Standard ordering appears to be:
  1. @type
  2. accessLevel
  3. bureauCode
  4. contactPoint
  5. description
  6. distribution
  7. identifier
  8. Other metadata properties in alphabetical order
- Distribution objects within arrays are being standardized with consistent property ordering
- The overall hierarchy and nesting of the JSON structure remains the same
- No properties are being systematically added or removed, just reordered

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the format and structure of the metadata rather than changing any actual content or terminology. This type of reorganization typically helps with consistency, maintainability, and automated processing of the metadata.
