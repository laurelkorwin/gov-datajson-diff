- Consolidation of distribution object structures
- Consistent formatting of contact information

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Media type descriptions are standardized (e.g., "text/plain", "application/json")
- Distribution object formats are standardized with consistent "@type": "dcat:Distribution"

Systematic Additions:
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" added to dataset entries
- "language": ["en-US"] added where missing
- Standardized license URLs

Concept Description Changes:
- More structured format for distribution objects with consistent property ordering
- Standardized contact point format with "@type": "vcard:Contact"

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within objects are now consistently alphabetically ordered
- Distribution arrays follow a consistent structure with standardized property sets
- Contact information is formatted consistently across entries

The changes appear focused on standardization and consistency in data structure rather than content changes, with an emphasis on making the format more uniform across all entries.
