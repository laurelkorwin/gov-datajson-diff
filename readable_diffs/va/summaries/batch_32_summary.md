Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes appear to be a large-scale reorganization of dataset metadata entries
- The structure of each dataset entry is being standardized with consistent property ordering
- Properties are being alphabetically sorted within each dataset object
- The @type field is being moved to the top of each dataset entry
- Contact information and distribution formats are being standardized

2. Terminology Patterns:
Consistent Replacements:
- No direct word/phrase replacements observed
- Format of property values remains the same

Systematic Changes:
- Property ordering is being standardized across all dataset entries
- Contact information format is being standardized with "@type": "vcard:Contact"
- Distribution formats are being standardized with "@type": "dcat:Distribution"

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties are being reordered alphabetically within each dataset object
- @type field is consistently moved to the top of each dataset entry
- Distribution array entries are being standardized in format
- Contact information blocks are being standardized
- Property grouping is more consistent across all dataset entries
- Nested objects (like distribution and contactPoint) maintain consistent internal structure

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and organization of the metadata rather than changing the actual content. This type of reorganization typically improves maintainability and makes it easier to process the data programmatically.
