Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties into alphabetical order
- Consistent formatting of distribution objects
- Addition of "@type" field to dataset and distribution objects
- Standardization of property ordering across multiple dataset entries
- No substantial content changes - mostly structural reorganization

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" at the top level of each dataset object
- Consistent addition of "@type": "dcat:Distribution" to distribution objects
- No systematic changes to actual terminology or descriptions
- Property names remain the same but are reordered

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties within each dataset object are now alphabetically ordered
- Distribution objects follow a consistent structure with properties in the same order:
  - @type
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType
- More consistent formatting and indentation throughout
- Nested objects (like contactPoint, publisher) maintain consistent internal structure
- No removal of data, just reorganization of existing properties

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and formatting of the JSON data, rather than modifying the actual content. This type of reorganization typically improves readability and makes the data structure more consistent across entries.
