Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes appear to be primarily reorganization and standardization of JSON metadata structures
- Multiple dataset entries are being modified with consistent formatting and field ordering
- No substantial content changes are observed - mostly restructuring existing information

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent ordering of fields is being implemented across all dataset entries
- Standard field names are being used uniformly (e.g., @type, accessLevel, bureauCode, etc.)
- No significant changes to actual terminology or descriptions
- Field values remain the same but are being reorganized in a more consistent structure

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- All dataset entries now follow a consistent structure with fields in alphabetical order
- The @type field is consistently moved to the top of each entry
- Distribution arrays are being standardized with consistent internal field ordering
- Contact information blocks are being standardized in format
- License and rights information is being consistently formatted
- Temporal and date fields are being standardized in presentation

The primary pattern appears to be a systematic reorganization of the JSON structure to follow a more consistent format, rather than changes to the actual content. This suggests an effort to standardize the metadata format across all dataset entries while preserving the underlying information.

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to improve data consistency and maintainability by enforcing a standard structure across all dataset entries in the system.
