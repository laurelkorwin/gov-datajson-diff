Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of dataset metadata entries to follow a more consistent structure
- Addition of new fields like "landingPage" and "language" to existing entries
- Standardization of distribution format descriptions
- Updates to temporal coverage information
- Modifications to contact information and publisher details

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution format descriptions are standardized with "@type": "dcat:Dataset" consistently added
- Media type descriptions are made more explicit (e.g., "application/pdf" instead of just "pdf")

Systematically Added Terms:
- "accrualPeriodicity" field added to many entries
- "dataQuality" field with boolean value
- Standardized language codes ("en-US")

Modified Concept References:
- More structured approach to describing temporal coverage
- Standardized format for contact information using vcard format
- Consistent publisher organization references

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Fields are reordered to follow a consistent pattern across entries
- Distribution descriptions are restructured to use a more standardized format
- Contact information is formatted more consistently using vcard structure
- Publisher information is standardized across entries
- License information is consistently formatted

The changes appear to be part of a larger effort to standardize dataset metadata formatting and ensure consistency across entries while adding missing required fields and standardizing existing information.
