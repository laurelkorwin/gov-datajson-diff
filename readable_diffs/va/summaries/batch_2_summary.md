Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON structure with consistent property ordering
- Addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" field moved to top of entries
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Addition of language and dataQuality fields to many entries
- Updates to various dataset titles and descriptions

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" at the start of entries
- Standardization of distribution media types and structure
- More consistent use of "dcat:Distribution" type declarations
- Systematic addition of language codes ("en-US")
- Consistent formatting of email addresses with "mailto:" prefix

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties are now consistently ordered alphabetically within each dataset entry
- Distribution objects follow a standard structure with consistent property ordering:
  - @type
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType
- Contact information is standardized with consistent vcard:Contact formatting
- More consistent use of nested objects for publisher and contact information
- Better organization of temporal and spatial metadata

The changes appear focused on improving consistency, standardization and machine-readability of the dataset metadata while maintaining the same core information. The restructuring makes the format more predictable and easier to process programmatically.
