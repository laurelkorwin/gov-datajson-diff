Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes primarily involve reordering and restructuring of JSON metadata entries
- No content is being removed or added, rather the existing content is being reorganized
- Properties within dataset objects are being alphabetically sorted
- The structure of distribution objects is being standardized

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent formatting changes in the distribution objects:
  - Properties are reordered to put "@type" first
  - Media type information is moved after the describedBy properties
- No changes to actual terminology or vocabulary
- Property names remain the same but are reordered systematically

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Dataset objects are now consistently structured with:
  - "@type" property first
  - Core metadata properties alphabetically ordered
  - Distribution arrays containing standardized object structures
- Distribution objects now follow a consistent pattern:
  - "@type" first
  - describedBy properties grouped together
  - downloadURL and mediaType at the end
- The overall hierarchy remains the same, but internal organization is more consistent
- Properties that were previously scattered are now grouped logically

The changes appear to be a systematic reorganization focused on standardizing the structure and ordering of metadata entries while preserving all the original content. This type of change typically improves maintainability and readability of the JSON data.
