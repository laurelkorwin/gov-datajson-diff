Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Extensive reorganization of metadata fields into a more consistent alphabetical order
- Addition of new fields like "accrualPeriodicity" and "dataQuality" to multiple entries
- Standardization of distribution format descriptions
- Updates to temporal and date-related information

- Standardization of email contact format to "mailto:" prefix
- Consistent formatting of organization names under publisher field
- Standardized license URL format
- Normalized temporal format (ISO 8601)

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Fields are now consistently ordered alphabetically within each dataset entry
- Distribution arrays are structured more consistently with standardized @type values
- Contact information is formatted uniformly across entries
- More consistent nesting of related fields (e.g., publisher information)
- Better organization of temporal and date-related fields

The changes appear focused on improving consistency and standardization across dataset entries while maintaining the same core information. The reorganization makes the data more machine-readable and easier to maintain.

Notable patterns include:
- Moving from loose to strict formatting of dates and times
- Standardizing contact information structure
- Consistent ordering of fields
- Normalized distribution format descriptions
- Uniform handling of license and rights information

The changes suggest an effort to align with a more structured metadata standard while making the content more consistent and maintainable.
