Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes appear to be primarily reorganization and standardization of JSON/metadata structure
- Multiple dataset entries are being reformatted with consistent property ordering
- No substantial content changes are evident - mostly restructuring existing data

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent property naming conventions are being applied across all dataset entries
- Standard property order appears to be:
  - @type
  - accessLevel
  - bureauCode
  - contactPoint
  - description
  - distribution
  - identifier
  - etc.
- No systematic changes to actual terminology or vocabulary used in the content

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Properties are being reordered in a consistent alphabetical pattern across all dataset entries
- JSON structure is being standardized with consistent indentation and property ordering
- Distribution arrays are being reformatted with consistent object structure
- Contact information blocks are being standardized in format
- Property groupings appear more logical and organized after changes

The primary change appears to be a large-scale reorganization effort to standardize the structure and formatting of dataset metadata entries, rather than changes to the actual content. This type of restructuring suggests an effort to improve consistency and maintainability of the data catalog while preserving the underlying information.

The changes focus on:
- Consistent property ordering
- Standardized formatting
- Uniform structure across dataset entries
- Better organization of related properties
- No significant content modifications

This appears to be primarily a technical cleanup/standardization effort rather than a content update.
