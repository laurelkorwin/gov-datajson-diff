Based on the git diff changes provided, here is my analysis:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON structure for dataset entries
- Consistent reordering of properties within dataset objects
- Standardization of property ordering across multiple entries
- No substantial content changes - mostly structural reorganization

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Property Order Standardization:
  - Properties are consistently reordered to follow pattern: @type, accessLevel, accrualPeriodicity, bureauCode, etc.
  - Contact information blocks are moved to consistent positions
  - Distribution arrays are consistently structured

- No significant terminology changes observed in the actual content
- Maintained consistent use of existing terms and descriptions

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" property to entries where it was missing
- Reorganization of nested objects (like distribution arrays) to follow consistent structure
- Properties within objects are alphabetically ordered
- Consistent formatting of arrays and nested objects
- Removal of redundant whitespace and standardization of indentation

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and format of the JSON data rather than modifying the actual content. This suggests an automated cleanup or standardization process was applied to improve consistency across the dataset entries.

The most significant pattern is the systematic reordering of properties within each dataset object to follow a consistent schema, making the data structure more uniform and predictable across all entries.
