- Consistent formatting of publisher information

2. Terminology Patterns:
Consistent Replacements:
- Media type declarations are standardized (e.g., "mediaType": "application/json" format)
- Distribution objects now consistently include "@type": "dcat:Distribution"

Added Terms:
- "accrualPeriodicity" field added to multiple datasets
- "dataQuality": true added systematically
- "@type": "dcat:Dataset" added consistently at the top level

Removed/Modified Terms:
- Some redundant or inconsistent rights declarations consolidated

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Fields are now consistently ordered alphabetically within each dataset
- Distribution arrays are structured more consistently with standardized field ordering
- Publisher information is standardized with consistent "@type": "org:Organization" format
- Contact point information follows a more consistent structure
- Dataset metadata blocks follow a more uniform pattern with consistent field presence and ordering

The changes appear focused on improving consistency and standardization across dataset metadata, with particular attention to field ordering, required fields, and standardized formatting of common elements like distributions and contact information.
