Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:

Added Terms:
- "dataQuality": true added to many entries

3. Structural Changes:
- Fields are reordered into a more consistent alphabetical sequence

The changes appear focused on improving consistency and standardization across the metadata entries while maintaining the same core information.
