Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata fields into alphabetical order
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Addition of new fields like "rights" and "mediaType"
- Consistent formatting of @type declarations
- Removal of redundant or deprecated fields

2. Terminology Patterns:

Consistent Replacements:
- Distribution objects now consistently list "@type" first
- Media type declarations moved into dedicated "mediaType" field
- Standardized order of fields within distribution objects

Added Terms:
- "mediaType" field added consistently to distribution objects
- "rights" field added in some cases
- "@type" declarations standardized at the start of objects

Removed Terms:
- Some redundant fields removed
- Inconsistent ordering of fields eliminated

3. Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Fields are now consistently ordered alphabetically within objects
- Distribution objects follow a standard structure:
  ```json
  {
    "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
    "describedBy": "...",
    "describedByType": "...", 
    "downloadURL": "...",
    "mediaType": "..."
  }
  ```
- More consistent placement of common fields like "identifier", "issued", "modified"
- Better organization of related fields (e.g., grouping all distribution-related fields together)

The changes appear focused on improving consistency, standardization and maintainability of the metadata structure while preserving the core content and relationships between fields.
