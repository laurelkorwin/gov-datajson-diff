Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties into a more consistent alphabetical ordering
- Addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" field to dataset entries
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Consistent formatting of media type declarations
- Movement of metadata fields into a more structured order

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent addition of "@type" field with value "dcat:Distribution" to distribution objects
- Standardization of media type declarations (moving from inline to structured format)
- Consistent ordering of fields like "identifier", "issued", "keyword", "landingPage", etc.
- No significant changes to actual content/values, mostly structural reorganization

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties within objects are now consistently ordered alphabetically
- Distribution objects follow a standard structure with "@type" declaration
- Media type information is now consistently structured with separate fields for:
  - describedBy
  - describedByType
  - downloadURL
  - mediaType
- Metadata fields are organized in a more consistent pattern across all dataset entries
- Better hierarchical organization of related properties

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and format of the data rather than changing the actual content. This suggests an effort to improve consistency and maintainability of the JSON data structure while preserving the underlying information.
