Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties into alphabetical order
- Consistent addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" at the start of dataset objects
- Removal of redundant language tags in some cases
- Movement of temporal and title fields to standardized positions
- Standardization of distribution object structures

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent formatting of "@type" field with value "dcat:Dataset"
- Standardization of contact information structure under "contactPoint"
- Consistent placement of identifier and license information
- Uniform handling of temporal data formats
- Standardized structure for distribution media types and URLs

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties within objects are now consistently alphabetically ordered
- Distribution arrays follow a consistent pattern with standardized property ordering
- Contact information is structured uniformly across entries
- Publisher information follows a consistent format
- Temporal data is formatted consistently when present
- More consistent handling of language tags and references

The changes appear focused on standardizing the structure and format of the dataset metadata entries while maintaining the same core information. The modifications seem aimed at improving consistency and machine readability of the data.

The reorganization makes the JSON more predictable and easier to parse, with properties appearing in a consistent order across all dataset entries. This type of standardization is valuable for API consumption and data processing.
