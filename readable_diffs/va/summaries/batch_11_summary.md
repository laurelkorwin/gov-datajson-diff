Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties into alphabetical order
- Consistent formatting and structure standardization
- Addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" field positioning at the start of objects
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- No significant content changes - mostly structural reorganization

2. Terminology Patterns:
- No systematic terminology changes observed
- Consistent use of existing terms and descriptions
- Property names remain unchanged (e.g., "accessLevel", "bureauCode", "contactPoint", etc.)
- Media type descriptions standardized (e.g., "application/rdf+xml", "application/json", etc.)

3. Notable Structural/Organizational Changes:
- Alphabetical ordering of all properties within objects
- Standardized structure for distribution arrays:
  ```json
  "distribution": [
    {
      "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
      "describedBy": "...",
      "describedByType": "...",
      "downloadURL": "...",
      "mediaType": "..."
    }
  ]
  ```
- Consistent placement of "@type" field at the beginning of objects
- More consistent indentation and formatting throughout
- Standardized order of common fields like "identifier", "issued", "modified", etc.

The changes appear to be primarily focused on improving consistency and organization rather than modifying actual content. This type of restructuring makes the data more maintainable and easier to read while preserving all the original information.
