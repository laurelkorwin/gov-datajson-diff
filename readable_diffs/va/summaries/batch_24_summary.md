Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of metadata fields into a more consistent alphabetical order
- Addition of "@type": "dcat:Dataset" field consistently at the start of records
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Consistent formatting of media type declarations
- Addition of missing fields like "identifier", "issued", "modified" in some records

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent replacement of standalone mediaType declarations with structured distribution objects
- Standardization of "@type": "dcat:Distribution" placement within distribution arrays
- Consistent ordering of fields within distribution objects (describedBy, describedByType, downloadURL, mediaType)
- Systematic addition of missing metadata fields across records

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Fields are now organized in a consistent alphabetical order across all records
- Distribution arrays follow a standard structure:
  ```json
  {
    "@type": "dcat:Distribution",
    "describedBy": "...",
    "describedByType": "...", 
    "downloadURL": "...",
    "mediaType": "..."
  }
  ```
- Dataset type declarations moved to start of records
- Contact information and publisher details formatted consistently
- Standardized placement of temporal, spatial and language metadata

The changes appear focused on improving consistency in metadata structure and formatting while maintaining the same core information. This standardization would make the data more predictable and easier to process programmatically.
