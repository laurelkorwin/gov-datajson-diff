Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- Reorganization of JSON object properties to follow a more consistent alphabetical ordering
- Standardization of distribution object structures
- Addition of "@type" field consistently at the start of dataset objects
- Consistent formatting of media type declarations
- Movement of identifier fields to a more standardized position

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent replacement of inline media type declarations with structured distribution objects
- Standardization of contact point formatting
- More structured approach to distribution metadata with consistent use of "@type" and descriptive fields
- Consistent formatting of license and rights declarations

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Properties within objects are now consistently ordered alphabetically
- Distribution objects follow a more standardized structure with consistent field ordering
- Contact point information is formatted more consistently
- More consistent placement of common fields like identifier, issued, and modified
- Better organization of metadata fields with related properties grouped together

The changes appear focused on improving consistency and standardization in the data structure rather than changing the actual content. This makes the data more predictable and easier to process programmatically.

The modifications seem to be part of a larger effort to standardize the format of VA dataset metadata, making it more consistent with common data catalog standards while maintaining the same core information.
