Here's my analysis of the git diff changes:

1. Key Changes Summary:
- The changes appear to be a large-scale reorganization of JSON data structure
- Most changes involve reordering of fields within dataset objects rather than content changes
- The overall structure moves from a more loosely organized format to a more standardized, alphabetized arrangement of fields
- Some fields are being removed while maintaining core dataset information

2. Terminology Patterns:
- Consistent field name standardization:
  - "@type": "dcat:Dataset" is being moved to the start of objects
  - Contact information is being standardized into a consistent format
  - Distribution arrays are being reformatted with consistent structure
  
- Systematic Removals:
  - Some optional fields like "language" arrays are being removed in some cases
  - Redundant or duplicate fields are being eliminated

- Description Changes:
  - The way datasets are described remains largely the same, but the formatting and structure around descriptions is more consistent

3. Notable Structural Changes:
- Field Ordering:
  - Fields are being reordered to follow a more consistent pattern
  - Common fields like "accessLevel", "bureauCode", and "contactPoint" are being grouped together
  - Distribution arrays are being standardized in their structure and placement

- Object Structure:
  - More consistent nesting of objects and arrays
  - Better organization of related fields
  - Cleaner separation between different types of metadata

- Data Quality:
  - Addition of explicit "dataQuality" fields in some cases
  - More consistent handling of temporal and spatial data

The changes appear to be primarily focused on standardizing the structure and format of the dataset metadata rather than changing the actual content of the datasets themselves. This suggests an effort to improve data consistency and maintainability across the VA's data catalog.
