The Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to analyze the data of selected metropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) with 500 or more respondents. BRFSS data can be used to identify emerging health problems, establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public health policies and programs. BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available. Detailed information on sampling methodology and quality assurance can be found on the BRFSS website (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss).

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistic web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\n\nFootnote:\n\u2014: No reported cases.

Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. \n\n* Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.  \n\n\u2020 This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. \n\n\u00a7 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\n\n\u00b6 Not reportable in all jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.\n\n** Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.   \n\n\u2020\u2020 Please refer to the CDC WONDER for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.  \n\n\u00a7\u00a7 Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2013 have been variant influenza viruses.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 Prior to 2018, cases of paratyphoid fever were included with salmonellosis cases (see Table II). \n\n*** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers'. NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implemented these case definitions. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process</b>\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported from state and local health departments through a robust process with the following steps:\n<ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration and set up alerts to monitor for discrepancies in the data.</li><li>CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>County level data were aggregated to obtain state- and territory- specific totals.</li><li>Counting of cases and deaths is based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in these data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data are organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts are calculated as the week-to-week change in cumulative counts of cases and deaths reported (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the prior week.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues.\n\n<b>Description</b>\nThis archived public use dataset focuses on the cumulative and weekly case and death rates per 100,000 persons within various sociodemographic factors across all states and their counties. All resulting data are expressed as rates calculated as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 persons in counties meeting various classification criteria using <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html\">the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program</a> (2019 Vintage).\n\nEach county within jurisdictions is classified into multiple categories for each factor. All rates in this dataset are based on classification of counties by the characteristics of their population, not individual-level factors.  This applies to each of the available factors observed in this dataset. Specific factors and their corresponding categories are detailed below.\n\n<b>Population-level factors</b>\nEach unique population factor is detailed below.

+            "description": "The process of stainless steel welding creates fumes rich in carcinogenic metals such as chromium (Cr). Welding consumables devoid of Cr are being produced in attempt to limit worker exposures to potentially toxic and carcinogenic metals. The study objective was to characterize a copper-nickel (Cu-Ni) fume generated using gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and determine the pulmonary deposition and toxicity of the fume in mice exposed by inhalation. Male A/J mice (6 \u2013 8 weeks of age) were exposed to air or Cu-Ni welding fumes for 2 (low deposition) or 4 (high deposition) hours/day for 10 days. Mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), macrophage function, and histopathological analysis were performed at various timepoints post-exposure to evaluate resolution. Characterization of the fume indicated that most of the particles were between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5m in diameter, with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.43 \u00b5m. Metal content of the fume was primarily Cu (~76%) and Ni (~12%). After exposure, BAL macrophages had a reduced ability to phagocytose E. coli at 1 and 7 days and lung cytotoxicity was evident and significant (>12-19% fold change). Loss of body weight was also significant at these two early timepoints. Lung inflammation, the predominant lesion identified by histopathology, was observed as a subacute response early that progressively resolved by 28 days with only macrophage aggregates remaining late (84 days). Future studies are planned to investigate the tumorigenic potential of Cu-Ni fume in A/J mice.",

These data were voluntarily reported to NHSN May 1, 2024 until November 1, 2024, at which time CMS began requiring acute care and critical access hospitals to electronically report information via NHSN about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, hospital bed census and capacity. Hospital bed capacity and occupancy data for all patients and for patients with COVID-19 or influenza for collection dates prior to May 1, 2024, represent data reported during a previously mandated reporting period as specified by the HHS Secretary, and data for collection dates May 1, 2024 \u2013 October 31, 2024 represent data reported voluntarily to NHSN. All RSV data through October 31, 2024 represent voluntarily reported data; as such, all voluntarily reported data included in this dataset represent reporting hospitals only for a given week and might not be complete or representative of all hospitals during the specified reporting periods.</li><li>NHSN monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress and capacity for all acute care and critical access hospitals in the United States.

Data were collected on participants<br />\n(clients) across four types of treatment programs, or modalities:<br />\nresidential, residential \"social model,\" nonmethadone outpatient, and<br />\noutpatient methadone (detoxification and maintenance). Data were<br />\ncollected in two phases. In Phase 1, treatment records were abstracted<br />\nfor clients who received treatment or were discharged between October<br />\n1, 1991, and September 30, 1992. In Phase 2, these clients were<br />\nlocated and recruited for a follow-up interview. The CALDATA design<br />\nand procedures included elements from several national treatment<br />\noutcome studies including the Drug Services Research Survey, Services Research Outcomes Study, National<br />\nTreatment Improvement Evaluation Study, and Drug Abuse<br />\nTreatment Outcome Study. The record abstract was designed<br />\nto collect identifying and locating information for interview<br />\nreference during the personal interviewing phase. The abstract also<br />\ncollected demographic, drug, or alcohol use, and treatment and service<br />\ninformation. The follow-up questionnaire covered time periods before,<br />\nduring, and after treatment and focused on topics such as ethnic and<br />\neducational background, drug and alcohol use, mental and physical<br />\nhealth, HIV and AIDS status, drug testing, illegal activities and<br />\ncriminal status, living arrangements and family issues, employment and<br />\nincome, and treatment for drug, alcohol, and mental health<br />\nproblems. Drugs included alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,<br />\ncocaine powder, crack, downers, hallucinogens, heroin, illegal<br />\nmethadone, inhalants, LSD, marijuana/hashish/THC, methamphetamines and<br />\nother stimulants, narcotics, over-the-counter drugs, PCP, ritalin or<br />\npreludin, and sedatives/hypnotics.

All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all \u201cPatients using their own eggs\u201d or for \u201cPatients with no prior ART using their own eggs.\u201d For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent\u2019s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research\u2014that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n * Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 For acute Hepatitis C, only confirmed cases were verified.",

The Summary dataset provides a full snapshot of clinic services and profile, patient characteristics, and ART success rates. It is worth noting that patient medical characteristics, such as age, diagnosis, and ovarian reserve, affect ART treatment\u2019s success. Comparison of success rates across clinics may not be meaningful because of differences in patient populations and ART treatment methods.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2009 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, Adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. In the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

These data do not include mandatory business closures, curfews, or requirements/recommendations for people to stay in their homes. Due to limitations of the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network Data Explorer, these data do not include tribes or cities, nor was a distinction made between county orders that applied county-wide versus those that were limited to unincorporated areas of the county. Effective and expiration dates were coded using only the date provided; no distinction was made based on the specific time of the day the order became effective or expired. These data do not necessarily represent an official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.</p>",

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.  NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.

For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u2020 Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.\r\n\u00a7 Data for meningococcal disease, invasive caused by serogroups ACWY; serogroup B; other serogroup; and unknown serogroup are available in Table I.",

More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html.\n\n\u2022 Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions\u2019 data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates.\n\n\u2022 Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories.\n\n\u2022 Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed.\n\n\u2022 Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html.\n\n\u2022 Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)\nand adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

The response to this disaster involved the efforts of tens of thousands of workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted health hazard evaluations (HHEs) of Deepwater Horizon Response onshore and offshore workers. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. Environmental air samples were collected in support of the goals.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted the following exposure evaluations:\n\n- We conducted evaluations on board vessels releasing dispersant. These vessels were deployed to perform small\u2010scale releases of dispersant in an area with surface oil contamination.\n- We assessed exposures during in\u2010situ (i.e., on site) burns of surface oil.\n- We assessed exposures on fishing and shrimping trawlers in the Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program that were assigned to remove surface oil by booming and skimming.\n- We assessed exposures aboard vessels located at the Deepwater Horizon incident site.\n- We assessed exposures during boom and vessel decontamination operations.",

This data set includes Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, ages 12 to 64 at the end of the calendar year, who were not dually eligible for Medicare and were continuously enrolled with comprehensive benefits for 12 months, with no more than one gap in enrollment exceeding 45 days. Enrollees who received services for both an MH condition and SUD in the year are counted toward both condition categories. Enrollees in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and select states with TAF data quality issues are not included. Results shown for the race and ethnicity subpopulation topic exclude enrollees in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Results shown for the primary language subpopulation topic exclude select states with data quality issues with the primary language variable in TAF. Some rows in the data set have a value of \"DS,\" which indicates that data were suppressed according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 Cell Suppression Policy for values between 1 and 10.\r\nThis data set is based on the brief: \"Medicaid and CHIP enrollees who received mental health or SUD services in 2020.\" Enrollees are assigned to an age group subpopulation using age as of December 31st of the calendar year. Enrollees are assigned to a sex or gender identity subpopulation using their latest reported sex in the calendar year. Enrollees are assigned to a race and ethnicity subpopulation using the state-reported race and ethnicity information in TAF when it is available and of good quality; if it is missing or unreliable, race and ethnicity is indirectly estimated using an enhanced version of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) (Race and ethnicity of the national Medicaid and CHIP population in 2020). Enrollees are assigned to an urban or rural subpopulation based on the 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code associated with their home or mailing address ZIP code in TAF (Rural Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in 2020). Enrollees are assigned to an eligibility category subpopulation using their latest reported eligibility group code, CHIP code, and age in the calendar year. Enrollees are assigned to a primary language subpopulation based on their reported ISO language code in TAF (English/missing, Spanish, and all other language codes) (Primary Language). Please refer to the full brief for additional context about the methodology and detailed findings. Future updates to this data set will include more recent data years as the TAF data become available.",

+            "description": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a disorder experienced by one-third of the veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War, with symptoms including fatigue, chronic pain, respiratory and memory problems. Exposure to toxic chemicals during the war, such as oil well fire smoke, pesticides, physiological stress, and nerve agents, is thought to have triggered abnormal neuroinflammatory responses that contribute to GWI. Previous studies using animal models have indicated that combined exposure to high physiological stress and GW-relevant organophosphates, such as sarin nerve agent and chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, produces neuroinflammation and changes in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, suggesting a neuroimmune basis for GWI. In the current study, we examined brain structure and immune function of a chronic rat model of GWI and showed that a combination of long-term corticosterone treatment (CORT, to mimic high physiological stress) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate exposure (DFP, to mimic sarin exposure) resulted in elevations of multiple inflammatory cytokines, an increased activated microglial population, and disrupted brain microstructure in the hippocampal regions. Moreover, prior exposures to these agents modeling the \u201cin-theater,\u201d initiating exposure conditions experienced by veterans with GWI can induce long-term alterations in neuroimmune signaling, resulting in an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to future immune challenges.  The goal of the study was to establish a long-term model of GWI in rats that would be more relevant to the current state of ill veterans.  As such, rats were initially exposed to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) for 1 week followed by a single exposure to the sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, to mimic \u201cin-theater\u201d conditions of high physiological stress and nerve agent exposure.  This initial exposure was followed up with 4 weeks of intermittent re-exposure to week-long bouts of CORT and a final exposure to the prototypical inflammagen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a systemic inflammatory challenge.",

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the reaction products generated from gas-phase bleach oxidants and limonene, a fragrance compound commonly found in indoor air due to personal care products and cleaning products.  Gas-phase reactions were prepared in Teflon chambers housing HOCl, Cl2, and limonene.  The resulting chemical products were collected and analyzed using gas-phase preconcentration following by gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Several chlorinated products were detected including a limonene chlorohydrin and limonene species containing one, two, and three chlorines.  Product concentration and yields were estimated for the most abundant products, and greater than 80% of the transformed limonene was represented in the detected products.  Temporal sampling of the reactions allowed time courses to be plotted for limonene transformation and chlorinated limonene product generation under different conditions including the treatments of HOCl/Cl2, Cl2 only, high vs. low relative humidity, and +/- ozone. These experiments provide additional insight into the chemical transformations initiated by sodium hypochlorite bleach oxidants in the gas phase which may be of interest to human health.",

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

The related CDC COVID Data Tracker site was revised or retired on May 10, 2023.\n\n<b>Note:</b>\n<b>May 3,2024:</b> Due to incomplete or missing hospital data received for the April 21,2024 through April 27, 2024 reporting period, the COVID-19 Hospital Admissions Level could not be calculated for CNMI and will be reported as \u201cNA\u201d or \u201cNot Available\u201d in the COVID-19 Hospital Admissions Level data released on May 3, 2024.\n\nThis dataset represents COVID-19 hospitalization data and metrics aggregated to county or county-equivalent, for all counties or county-equivalents (including territories) in the United States. COVID-19 hospitalization data are reported to CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States.

Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Prior to December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System (UHDSS). </li><li>While CDC reviews these data for errors and corrects those found, some reporting errors might still exist within the data. To minimize errors and inconsistencies in data reported, CDC removes outliers before calculating the metrics. CDC and partners work with reporters to correct these errors and update the data in subsequent weeks.</li><li>Many hospital subtypes, including acute care and critical access hospitals, as well as Veterans Administration, Defense Health Agency, and Indian Health Service hospitals, are included in the metric calculations provided in this report.

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geography that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time both as of the given row date and as of the most current data submitted is characterized as increasing, decreasing or stable to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on the opening page are based on rolling regression model assessments of the slope for each respiratory illness. Weeks with a significant time term (p <0.05) are classified as increasing when the slope is positive and decreasing when the slope is negative. Weeks with a non-significant time term (p \u2265 0.05) are classified as stable. A 3-week moving average is applied to the time series prior to the regression procedure in order to smooth week-to-week variation. \n<br>\nFor additional information, please see:<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n<br>\nUpdated once per week on Fridays.",

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

The present study evaluated the systemic and immunotoxicity of sub-chronic 28- or 10-day dermal exposure of PFHxS (0.625-5% or 15.63-125 mg/kg/dose) in a murine model.  Elevated levels of PFHxS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route.  Liver weight (% body) significantly increased and spleen weight (% body) significantly deceased with PFHxS exposure supported by histopathological changes. Additionally, PFHxS significantly reduced the humoral immune response and altered immune subsets in the spleen, suggesting immunosuppression.  Gene expression changes were observed in the liver, skin, and spleen with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, necrosis, and inflammation.  Immune-cell phenotyping identified significant decreases in B-cells, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in the spleen along with increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and neutrophils in the skin.  These findings support dermal PFHxS-induced liver damage and immune suppression.  These data support PFHxS absorption through the skin and demonstrate immunotoxicity via this exposure route, raising concern about prompting the need for further investigation.",

SARS-CoV-2 can spread by exposure to droplets and very fine aerosol particles from respiratory fluids that are released by infected persons. Layered mitigation strategies, including but not limited to maintaining physical distancing, adequate ventilation, universal masking, avoiding overcrowding, and vaccination, have shown to be effective in re-ducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the indoor environment. Here, we examine the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosol particles within a classroom-style meeting room. To quantify exposure of uninfected individuals (Recip-ients), surrogate respiratory aerosol particles were generated by a breathing simulator with a headform (Source) that mimicked breath exhalations. Recipients, represented by three breathing simulators with manikin headforms, were placed in a meeting room and affixed with optical particle counters to measure 0.3\u20133 \u00b5m aerosol particles.",

Because the surveillance areas and age groups included in surveillance have changed over time, trends should be interpreted with caution. RSV-NET is CDC\u2019s source for important data on rates of hospitalizations associated with RSV. Hospitalization rates show how many people in the surveillance area are hospitalized with RSV, compared to the total number of people residing in that area. \n\nData are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available.

More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html. \n\n\u2022 Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions\u2019 data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. \n\n\u2022 Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. \n\n\u2022 Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed. \n\n\u2022 Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html. \n\n\u2022 Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)                 \nand adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.",

All four datasets may be linked by \u201cClinicID.\u201d ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all \u201cPatients using their own eggs\u201d or for \u201cPatients with no prior ART using their own eggs.\u201d For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent\u2019s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer. This dataset excludes cycles that were considered research\u2014that is, cycles performed to evaluate new procedures.",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Throughout 2020 and 2021, that report was subsequently updated with refreshed data 13 times.

HHEs are requested by employees or their representatives, or employers, to help learn whether health hazards are present at their workplace. The scope of HHEs varies based on the requestors\u2019 concerns and the NIOSH project officers\u2019 professional judgment. Only noise measurement results are included in this database; however, many HHEs include evaluation of exposures other than noise. Individual HHE reports are published on the NIOSH website. When available, the database provides a direct link to the HHE report for each of the noise measurement results.\n\nThe noise database contains workplace noise measurement results from 77 HHE reports, including over 808 personal noise exposure measurements and 582 area noise measurements. It also includes the following information: U.S. state or territory; Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) region; National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) sector; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code; facility description; type of dosimeter or sound level meter used; whether a hearing conservation program was in place; whether a hearing protection was used; whether octave band data was collected; job title; noise-generating activities; location of noise measurements; start and end date for site visit; type (full-shift, partial-shift, or task-based) and duration of noise measurement; type of noise (continuous, impulsive, or intermittent); exposure to ototoxic chemicals; and results in decibels A-weighted (dBA) and percent dose according to OSHA and NIOSH noise measurement criteria. This database is an ongoing project and will be updated at least yearly to add the most recent HHE noise measurement data.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

For purposes of this collection, a drug \"episode\" is an ED visit<br />\nthat was induced by or related to the use of an illegal drug or the<br />\nnonmedical use of a legal drug for patients aged six years and<br />\nolder. A drug \"mention\" refers to a substance that was mentioned<br />\nduring a drug-related ED episode. Because up to four drugs can be<br />\nreported for each drug abuse episode, there are more mentions than<br />\nepisodes in the data. Individual persons may also be included more<br />\nthan once in the data. Within each facility participating in DAWN, a<br />\ndesignated reporter, usually a member of the emergency department or<br />\nmedical records staff, was responsible for identifying drug-related<br />\nepisodes and recording and submitting data on each case. An episode<br />\nreport was submitted for each patient visiting a DAWN emergency<br />\ndepartment whose presenting problem(s) was/were related to their own<br />\ndrug use. DAWN produces estimates of drug-related emergency department<br />\nvisits for 50 specific drugs, drug categories, or combinations of<br />\ndrugs, including the following: acetaminophen, alcohol in combination<br />\nwith other drugs, alprazolam, amitriptyline, amphetamines, aspirin,<br />\ncocaine, codeine, diazepam, diphenhydramine, fluoxetine,<br />\nheroin/morphine, inhalants/solvents/aerosols, LSD, lorazepam,<br />\nmarijuana/hashish, methadone, methamphetamine, and PCP/PCP in<br />\ncombination with other drugs. The use of alcohol alone is not<br />\nreported. The route of administration and form of drug used (e.g.,<br />\npowder, tablet, liquid) are included for each drug. Data collected for<br />\nDAWN also include drug use motive and total drug mentions in the<br />\nepisode, as well as race, age, patient disposition, reason for ED<br />\nvisit, and day of the week, quarter, and year of episode.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Notice: In Table 1n of the 2020 NNDSS weekly tables for weeks 1-53, data for Haemophilus influenzae in children < 5 years categorized as \"non-b serotype\" and \"unknown serotype\" were updated on 02/26/2021 to correct the data associated with these two serotype categories. The original version of the tables incorrectly displayed data for \"non-b serotype\" in the \"unknown serotype\" column and incorrectly displayed data for \"unknown serotype\" in the \"non-b serotype\" column. The data are corrected now.\n\nNotice: Data from California published in week 29 for years 2019 and 2020 were incomplete when originally published on July 24, 2020. On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia (DC)\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2010 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the ZCTA level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts.\n\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts. Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Provisional data presented will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\n\nFor more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm",

+            "description": "The Research and Development Survey (RANDS) is a platform designed for conducting survey question evaluation and statistical research. RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS\u2019 higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population counts, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the Census 2021 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the ZCTA level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software.\nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2012 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

The report includes data for the states using State-based Marketplaces (SBMs) that use their own eligibility and enrollment platforms<br />\r\n<b>Source:</b> State-based Marketplace (SBM) operational data submitted to CMS. Each monthly reporting period occurs during the first through last day of the reported month. SBMs report relevant Marketplace activity from April 2023 (when unwinding-related renewals were initiated in most SBMs) through the end of a state\u2019s Medicaid unwinding renewal period and processing timeline, which will vary by SBM.  Some SBMs did not receive unwinding-related applications during reporting period months in April or May 2023 due to renewal processing timelines. SBMs that are no longer reporting Marketplace activity due to the completion of a state\u2019s Medicaid unwinding renewal period are marked as NA. Some SBMs may revise data from a prior month and thus this data may not align with that previously reported. For April, Idaho\u2019s reporting period was from February 1, 2023 to April 30, 2023.<br />\t\t\r\n<b>Notes:</b>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>This table represents consumers whose Medicaid/CHIP coverage was denied or terminated following renewal and 1) whose applications were processed by an SBM through an integrated Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace eligibility system or 2) whose applications/information was sent by a state Medicaid or CHIP agency to an SBM through an account transfer process. Consumers who submitted applications to an SBM that can be matched to a Medicaid/CHIP record are also included. See the \"Data Sources and Metrics Definition Overview\" at http://www.medicaid.gov for a full description of the differences between the SBM operating systems and resulting data metrics, measure definitions, and general data limitations. As of the September 2023 report, this table was updated to differentiate between SBMs with an integrated Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace eligibility system and those with an account transfer process to better represent the percentage of QHP selections in relation to applicable consumers received and processed by the relevant SBM. State-specific variations are:      \r\n- Maine\u2019s data and Nevada\u2019s April and May 2023 data report all applications with Medicaid/CHIP denials or terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process. \r\n- Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington also report applications with consumers determined ineligible for Medicaid/CHIP due to procedural reasons.\r\n- Minnesota and New York report on eligibility and enrollment for their Basic Health Programs (BHP). Effective April 1, 2024, New York transitioned its BHP to a program operated under a section 1332 waiver, which expands eligibility to individuals with incomes up to 250% of FPL. As of the March 2024 data, New York reports on consumers with expanded eligibility and enrollment under the section 1332 waiver program in the BHP data.\r\n- Idaho\u2019s April data on consumers eligible for a QHP with financial assistance do not depict a direct correlation to consumers with a QHP selection.\r\n- Virginia transitioned from using the HealthCare.gov platform in Plan Year 2023 to an SBM using its own eligibility and enrollment platform in Plan Year 2024. Virginia's data are reported in the HealthCare.gov and HeathCare.gov Transitions Marketplace Medicaid Unwinding Reports through the end of 2024 and is available in SBM reports as of the April 2024 report. Virginia's SBM data report all applications with Medicaid/CHIP denials or terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process, and as a result are not directly comparable to their data in the HealthCare.gov data reports.\r\n- Only SBMs with an automatic plan assignment process have and report automatic QHP selections.

Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI induces OA remain an active area of research. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. Upon exposure to outside stimuli, macrophages are polarized into either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization is associated with asthma development where M2 macrophage populations are usually pronounced in lungs of asthmatic patients. Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that M2 macrophage associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI exposure, indicating that MDI may induce M2 macrophage polarization; however, the underling molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI causes induction of M2 associated markers and chemokines is unclear. M2 macrophage polarization can be regulated by activation of several M2 associated transcription factors; however, whether MDI exposure regulates these transcription factors is unknown. We hypothesize that MDI exposure induces M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines through upregulation of M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in macrophages. The first aim of this study is to verify whether MDI-exposure can induce M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokine expression that were observed in previous studies and to identify candidate M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in response to MDI exposure that may account for the M2 macrophage polarization. After identification of the candidate transcription factor(s) that can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigate the roles of the candidate transcription factor in regulation of these candidate M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines in relation to the exposure to MDI.",

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2018\u20132022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the census 2022 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 40 measures at the county level.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as \u201cUnreliable\u201d in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999\u20132015. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).",

+            "description": "This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality. \r\n\r\nDeaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

Considering the projected increase in the production and use of nanomaterials, a corresponding increase in occupational exposure to nanomaterials and their resulting adverse health effects may be anticipated among workers. There is substantial evidence in the literature, based on cell culture and animal studies, supporting the potential toxicity and detrimental health effects associated with exposure to nanomaterials. Intervention and/or prevention of adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a concern for health providers and regulatory and non-regulatory government agencies as the use of nanomaterials expand. A key element in the intervention and/or prevention of the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary toxicity induced by nanomaterials.\n\nDue to its physicochemical and mechanical properties, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have found many industrial applications. There is potential for human exposure to MWCNT or products that contain MWCNT both during the production and use of the materials that contain MWCNT. The objectives of the current study were to investigate MWCNT-induced lung toxicity and the molecular mechanisms underlying that toxicity. A rat inhalation exposure model was employed to determine the lung toxicity induced by MWCNT. Global gene expression profiles in the lung and blood were conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying MWCNT-induced lung toxicity.",

Please refer to the PDF or Excel version of this table in the HUS 2019 Data Finder (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/contents2019.htm) for critical information about measures, definitions, and changes over time. Due to a change in national medical data coding standards in 2015, from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the ICD-10-CM, the definition for injuries and injury subcategories changed for the 2017 reporting period and beyond. Results from 2017 and subsequent years should not be compared with previous reporting periods. Any observed changes in trends across this transition period should not be considered. Data for 2016 are not included. Additional information regarding injury definitions and categorization of injuries by mechanism and intent of injury is available at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/injury/injury_tools.htm. Note that the data file available here has more recent years of data than what is shown in the PDF or Excel version.\n\nSOURCE: NCHS, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

For each month from April 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024, states were required to submit to CMS (on a timely basis), and CMS was required to make public, certain monthly data, including the total number of beneficiaries who were enrolled in a separate CHIP program. Accordingly, this historic dataset contains separate CHIP enrollment by month and state between April 2023 and June 2024.</p>\r\n<p>CMS will continue to publicly report separate CHIP enrollment by month and state (beyond the historic CAA/Unwinding period) in a new dataset, which is available at <a href=\"https://data.medicaid.gov/dataset/4723da0d-4d04-46ce-8163-e4b58c8fe728\">[link]</a>. Please note that the methods used to count separate CHIP enrollees differ slightly between the two datasets; as a result, data users should exercise caution if comparing separate CHIP enrollment across the two datasets.</p>\r\n<p><b>Sources:</b> T-MSIS Analytic Files (TAF) and state-submitted enrollment totals. The data notes indicate when a state\u2019s monthly total was a state-submitted value, rather than from T-MSIS.<br /><br />TAF data were pulled as follows:<br />April 2023 enrollment - TAF as of August 2023<br />May 2023 enrollment - TAF as of August 2023<br />June 2023 enrollment - TAF as of September 2023<br />July 2023 enrollment - TAF as of October 2023<br />August 2023 enrollment - TAF as of November 2023<br />September 2023 enrollment - TAF as of December 2023<br />October 2023 enrollment - TAF as of January 2024<br />November 2023 enrollment - TAF as of February 2024<br />December 2023 enrollment - TAF as of March 2024<br />January 2024 enrollment - TAF as of April 2024<br />February 2024 enrollment - TAF as of May 2024<br />March 2024 enrollment - TAF as of June 2024<br />April 2024 enrollment \u2013 TAF as of July 2024<br/>May 2024 enrollment \u2013 TAF as of August 2024<br/>June 2024 enrollment \u2013 TAF as of September 2024</p>\t\r\n<p>TAF are produced one month after the T-MSIS submission month. For example, TAF as of August 2023 is based on July T-MSIS submissions.</p>\r\n<p><b>Notes:</b> The separate CHIP enrollment in this report is not inclusive of enrollees covered by Medicaid expansion CHIP. Enrollment includes individuals enrolled in separate CHIP at any point during the month but excludes those enrolled in both Medicaid and separate CHIP during the month. See the Data Sources and Metrics Definitions Overview document for a full description of the data sources, metric definitions, and general data limitations.<br /><br />Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wyoming do not have separate CHIP Programs. Maryland has a separate CHIP program that began in July 2023; April 2023 - June 2023 data for Maryland represents retroactive coverage. <br /><br />This document includes separate CHIP data submitted to CMS by states via T-MSIS or a separate collection form. These data include reporting metrics consistent with section 1902(tt)(1) of the Social Security Act.<br /><br />CHIP: Children's Health Insurance Program</p>\t\r\n<p><b>Data notes:</b> \r\n(a) State-submitted value; data not from T-MSIS<br />(b1) May 2023 enrollment pulled from TAF as of September 2023<br />(b2) Data was restated using TAF as of October 2023<br />(b3) Data was restated using TAF as of April 2024<br />(b4) Data was restated using TAF as of July 2024<br />(b5) Data was restated using TAF as of August 2024<br />(c) Enrollment counts include postpartum women with coverage funded via a Health Services Initiative</p>",

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs,<br />\nalcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12<br />\nand older. Questions include age at first use as well as lifetime,<br />\nannual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:<br />\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,<br />\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including<br />\npain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey<br />\ncovers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for<br />\ntreatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical<br />\nManual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be<br />\napplied. The survey includes questions concerning treatment for both<br />\nsubstance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents are<br />\nalso asked about personal and family income sources and amounts,<br />\nhealth care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record,<br />\nproblems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.<br />\nQuestions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the<br />\n2002 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to<br />\n17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such<br />\nas neighborhood environment, illegal activities, gang involvement,<br />\ndrug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities,<br />\nexposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and<br />\nperceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as<br />\nschool work. Several measures focused on prevention related themes in<br />\nthis section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access<br />\nto care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of<br />\ndrugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on<br />\nthe tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey<br />\nand have been retained through the 2002 survey.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html \r\n\r\nFootnotes: \r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

The weekly cumulatve COVID-19 \u2013associated hospitalization estimates are preliminary, and use reported weekly hospitalizations among laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. The data are updated week-by-week as new COVID-19 hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the COVID-NET system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of COVID-19 -associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7]. \n \n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent COVID-19-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",
