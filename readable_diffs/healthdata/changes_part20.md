The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act or PPPHCEA (P.L. 116-139) appropriated an additional $75 billion for relief funds, and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act appropriated an additional $3 billion.  HRSA established the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) to administer payments to eligible providers. A portion of the PRF funds are being used to provide reimbursement to providers for administering Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized COVID-19 vaccines under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or FDA-licensed COVID-19 vaccines under a Biologics License Application (BLA) to underinsured individuals.

In this study, we used pulmonary-associated cell lines to assess the in vitro cytotoxic effects of thirty flavoring chemicals. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and both na\u00efve and activated macrophages (THP-1) were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 \u00b5M of flavoring chemicals and analyzed for changes in viability, cell membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammatory cytokine release. Viability was most greatly affected by decanal, hexanal, nonanal, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, vanillin, alpha-pinene, eugenol, and limonene. High amounts of ROS were elicited by vanillin, ethyl maltol, and the diketones (2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-heptanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione) from both cell lines. Na\u00efve THP-1 cells produced significant levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 when exposed to ethyl maltol and hexanal. Activated THP-1 cells released increased IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 when exposed to ethyl maltol, but many flavoring chemicals had an apparent suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokines released by activated macrophages, with varying degrees of accompanying cytotoxicity. The diketones, L-carvone, and linalool, suppressed cytokine release in the absence of cytotoxicity. These findings provide insight into patterns of cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine release potentially relevant to the development of pathological changes in the lungs of e-cigarette users.",

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  \r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\n\u201cSymbols and footnotes changed in week #4, please refer to the MMWR publication for the symbols/footnotes for weeks 1, 2, and 3\u201d.\r\n\r\nFootnote:\r\n-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable    NA: Not available NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.  NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n* Case counts for reporting year 2016 are provisional and subject to change.  Data for years 2011 through 2015 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. \r\n\u2020 This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.  \r\n\u00a7 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. \r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly reports from the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. \r\n** Not reportable in all reporting jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html.\r\n\u2020\u2020 Office of Management and Budget approval of the NNDSS Revision #0920-0728 on January 21, 2016, authorized CDC to receive data for these conditions. CDC is in the process\r\nof soliciting data for these conditions (except Zika virus, congenital infection). CDC and the U.S. states are still modifying the technical infrastructure needed to collect and transmit data for Zika virus congenital infections.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7 Jamestown Canyon virus and Lacrosse virus have replaced California serogroup diseases.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for Haemophilus influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.\r\n***  Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.  \r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. \r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II. \r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. \r\n**** Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. \r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. \r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 All cases reported have occurred in travelers returning from affected areas, with their sexual contacts, or infants infected in ute",

PLACES covers the entire United States\u201450 states and the District of Columbia\u2014at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for seven measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from NHANES, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and risk factor. NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S, and combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES stopped collecting vision and eye health data in 2008. Approximate sample size is 5,000 persons per year. NHANES data for VEHSS includes questions and examinations related to Visual Function, Vision Exam Measures, Eye Health Conditions, Service Utilization, and Examination Measures. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Detailed information on VEHSS NHANES analyses can be found on the VEHSS NHANES webpage (https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey.html). Additional information about NHANES can be found on the NHANES website (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). The VEHSS NHANES dataset was last updated in June 2018.",

In this paper, the melted substance is metal wire generated by an electric arc and forcibly coated on a rotary iron substrate using compressed air. This thermal process is referred to as double-wire arc thermal spray. The particles generated through these methods fall within the nanometer to micrometer agglomerate size range. There is concern regarding potential human health outcomes as these particles exhibit a similarity in particle morphology to welding fumes. Thermal spray wires with Zn (PMET540), Fe and Cr (PMET731), and Ni (PMET885) as primary metal compositions were used to generate particulate via an electric arc wire thermal spray generator for exposure to human bronchial cells (BEAS-2B) to examine comparative toxicity ranging from 0-200 \u00b5g/mL. Resulting cellular viability was assessed through live cell counts, and percent cytotoxicity was measured as a function of LDH release. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and alteration in Total Antioxidant Capacity were evaluated through DNA damage (COMET analysis) and antioxidant concentration at 0, 3.125, 25, and 100 \u00b5g/mL. Protein markers for Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were also assessed to determine inflammation and endothelial alteration.",

The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.

Medical office projected estimates are claims-based only. \n \n- The sampled pharmacies and physician medical offices and the captured volume of transactions represent approximately 92% and 82% of influenza vaccines administered nationally, respectively. \n \n- Vaccinations administered in other settings such as workplaces and community settings are not included in these data. \n \n\n*National estimates for pharmacies and medical offices include vaccinations administered in 50 states and DC. National estimates for medical office vaccinations do not include doses where geographic information (i.e. which state the dose was administered in) was missing. Pharmacy data are through Friday of each week and medical office data are through Saturday of each week. Week ending dates for prior seasons are aligned with the current season\u2019s week ending dates. \n\n\u00a7 1) King, L. M., Bartoces, M., Fleming-Dutra, K. E., et. al, L. A. (2020).

TEDS-A provides annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs that receive public funding. The unit of analysis is a treatment admission. TEDS consists of data reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs, which in turn report it to SAMHSA.<br />\nA sister data system, called the Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D), collects data on discharges from substance abuse treatment facilities. The first year of TEDS-A data is 1992, while the first year of TEDS-D is 2006.<br />\nTEDS variables that are required to be reported are called the \"Minimum Data Set (MDS)\", while those that are optional are called the \"Supplemental Data Set (SuDS)\".<br />\nVariables in the MDS include: information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment status, substance(s) abused, route of administration, frequency of use, age at first use, and whether methadone was prescribed in treatment. Supplemental variables include: diagnosis codes, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, source of income, health insurance, expected source of payment, pregnancy and veteran status, marital status, detailed not in labor force codes, detailed criminal justice referral codes, days waiting to enter treatment, and the number of arrests in the 30 days prior to admissions (starting in 2008).<br />\nSubstances abused include alcohol, cocaine and crack, marijuana and hashish, heroin, nonprescription methadone, other opiates and synthetics, PCP, other hallucinogens, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, other stimulants, benzodiazepines, other non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers, barbiturates, other non-barbiturate sedatives or hypnotics, inhalants, over-the-counter medications, and other substances.<br />\nCreated variables include total number of substances reported, intravenous drug use (IDU), and flags for any mention of specific substances.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015\u20132019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=3b7221d4e47740cab9235b839fa55cd7",

Obesity, affecting over 40% of American adults, disrupts adipocyte metabolism leading to chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction (MetDys). MetDys is associated with impaired lung function, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of silica inhalation in a pre-existing MetDys animal model to determine if an occupational exposure of silica dust has the potential to initiate or further the progression of MetDys associated conditions.",

This data set includes Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, except where otherwise noted. Enrollees in Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are not included. Results include enrollees with comprehensive Medicaid or CHIP benefits for all 12 months of the year and who were younger than age 19 at the end of the calendar year. Results shown for the race and ethnicity subpopulation topic exclude enrollees in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Results shown for the primary language subpopulation topic exclude select states with data quality issues with the primary language variable in TAF. Some rows in the data set have a value of \"DS,\" which indicates that data were suppressed according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 Cell Suppression Policy for values between 1 and 10.\r\nThis data set is based on the brief: \"Medicaid and CHIP enrollees who received a well-child visit in 2020.\" Enrollees are identified as receiving a well-child visit in the year according to the Line 6 criteria in the Form CMS-416 reporting instructions. Enrollees are assigned to an age group subpopulation using age as of December 31st of the calendar year. Enrollees are assigned to a race and ethnicity subpopulation using the state-reported race and ethnicity information in TAF when it is available and of good quality; if it is missing or unreliable, race and ethnicity is indirectly estimated using an enhanced version of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) (Race and ethnicity of the national Medicaid and CHIP population in 2020). Enrollees are assigned to an urban or rural subpopulation based on the 2010 Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code associated with their home or mailing address ZIP code in TAF (Rural Medicaid and CHIP enrollees in 2020). Enrollees are assigned to a program type subpopulation based on the CHIP code and eligibility group code that applies to the majority of their enrolled-months during the year (Medicaid-Only Enrollment; M-CHIP and S-CHIP Enrollment). Enrollees are assigned to a primary language subpopulation based on their reported ISO language code in TAF (English/missing, Spanish, and all other language codes) (Primary Language). Please refer to the full brief for additional context about the methodology and detailed findings. Future updates to this data set will include more recent data years as the TAF data become available.",

To study the mechanisms of these disorders, a new rat-tail model has been established to mimic the finger pressure and vibration exposures. However, the mechanical behavior of the tail during compression needs to be better understood to improve the model and its applications. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the static and time-dependent force responses of the rat tail during compression. Compression tests were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley cadaver rat tails using a micromechanical testing system at three deformation velocities and three deformation magnitudes. Contact-width, and the time-histories of force and deformation were measured. Additionally, force-relaxation tests were conducted and a Prony series was used to model the force-relaxation behavior of the tail.",

The only variables included in the data file are ones that were collected in a comparable manner across all ten years of data.<br />\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.<br />\nIn the income section, which was interviewer-administered, a split-sample study had been embedded within the 2006 and 2007 surveys to compare a shorter version of the income questions with a longer set of questions that had been used in previous surveys. This shorter version was adopted for the 2008 NSDUH and will be used for future NSDUHs.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.\n\nUnderstanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.",

De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies.\nInfection-induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with antibody evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and refers to the percent of the population with anti-nucleocapsid antibodies.\nCombined infection-Induced and Vaccination-Induced seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with antibody evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both, and refers to the percent of the population that has anti-spike antibodies, anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, or both.\n\nThis link connects to a webpage that displays the data from the Nationwide Blood Donor Seroprevalence Survey.

Findings are based on a sample of visits to non-federally employed office-based physicians who are primarily engaged in direct patient care. Physicians in the specialties (including designated sub-specialties) of anesthesiology, pathology, and radiology are excluded from the survey. The survey was conducted annually from 1973 to 1981, again in 1985, and annually since 1989. \nData collection from the physician, rather than from the patient, provides an analytic base that expands information on ambulatory care collected through other NCHS surveys. Data about the physician and their practice characteristics are collected during a survey induction interview.\nFor survey years 1973 to 1991, there are two data files: one for patient visit data and a second for drug mention data. The second file is limited to those visits with mention of medication therapy. For the 1991 data, it is possible to link information on the drug file with information on the patient visit file. Beginning with the 1992 survey year through 2011, one main data file was produced annually that contains both patient visit and drug information.",

Physicians whom the AMA classifies as \u201chospital-employed\u201d were added to the sampling frame starting with the 2014 NAMCS.

In this Table, provisional* cases of selected\u2020 notifiable diseases (\u22651,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\nFootnotes:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\nU: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.   NP:  Nationally notifiable but not published.   Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.

For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. \r\n\u2020 Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.",

Data for a state are considered unusable based on DQ Atlas thresholds for the following topics: Total Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment, Claims Volume - IP, Claims Volume - OT, Claims Volume - IP, Diagnosis Code - IP, Diagnosis Code - OT, Procedure Codes - OT Professional, Gender, Age, Zip code, Race and ethnicity, Eligibility group code, Enrollment in CMC Plans. \r\n\r\nData from Maryland, Tennessee, and Utah are omitted for the tables due to data quality concerns. Maryland was excluded in 2017 due to unusable diagnosis codes in the IP file and the OT file. Tennessee was excluded due to unusable diagnosis codes in the IP file in 2017 - 2019. Utah was excluded due to unusable procedure codes on OT professional claims in 2017 - 2020. In addition, states with a high data quality concern on one or more measures are noted in the table in the \"Data Quality\" column. Please refer to the DQ Atlas at http://medicaid.gov/dq-atlas for more information about data quality assessment methods. \r\n\r\nSome cells have a value of \u201cDS\u201d.

Polarization of the macrophages regulates the production of proinflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs) to mediate acute inflammation and its resolution in a time-dependent manner. Here we examined the molecular mechanism by which multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs, Mitsui-7) induce M1 polarization in vitro. Treatment of murine macrophages (J774A.1) with Mitsui-7 MWCNTs increased the expression of Alox5 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The MWCNTs induced the expression of CD68, and that induction persisted for up to 3 days post-exposure. The expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase, an intracellular marker of M1, were increased by MWCNTs. Consistent with M1 polarization, the MWCNTs induced the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, and proinflammatory LMs leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The cell-free media from MWCNT-polarized macrophages induced the migration of neutrophilic cells (differentiated from HL-60), which was blocked by Acebilustat, a specific leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, or LY239111, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, but not NS-398, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, revealing LTB4 as a major mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis from MWCNT-polarized macrophages. Knockdown of Alox5 using specific small hairpin-RNA suppressed MWCNT-induced M1 polarization, LTB4 secretion, and migration of neutrophils. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the polarization of M1 macrophages by Mitsui-7 MWCNTs in vitro and that induction of Alox5 is an important mechanism by which the MWCNTs promote proinflammatory responses by boosting M1 polarization and production of proinflammatory LMs.",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

The related CDC COVID Data Tracker site was revised or retired on May 10, 2023.\n\nThis dataset represents daily COVID-19 hospitalization data and metrics aggregated to national, state/territory, and regional levels. COVID-19 hospitalization data are reported to CDC\u2019s National Healthcare Safety Network, which monitors national and local trends in healthcare system stress, capacity, and community disease levels for approximately 6,000 hospitals in the United States.

Data reported by hospitals to NHSN represent aggregated counts and include metrics capturing information specific to hospital capacity, occupancy, hospitalizations, and admissions. Prior to December 15, 2022, hospitals reported data directly to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or via a state submission for collection in the HHS Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System (UHDSS).</li><li>While CDC reviews these data for errors and corrects those found, some reporting errors might still exist within the data. To minimize errors and inconsistencies in data reported, CDC removes outliers before calculating the metrics. CDC and partners work with reporters to correct these errors and update the data in subsequent weeks.</li><li>Many hospital subtypes, including acute care and critical access hospitals, as well as Veterans Administration, Defense Health Agency, and Indian Health Service hospitals, are included in the metric calculations provided in this report. Psychiatric, rehabilitation, and religious non-medical hospital types are excluded from calculations.</li><li>Data are aggregated and displayed for hospitals with the same Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Certification Number (CCN), which are assigned by CMS to counties based on the CMS Provider of Services files.</li><li>Full details on COVID-19 hospital data reporting guidance can be found here: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf</li></ul>\n\n<b>Metric details:</b><ul><li><b>Time Period:</b> timeseries data will update weekly on Mondays as soon as they are reviewed and verified, usually before 8 pm ET. Updates will occur the following day when reporting coincides with a federal holiday. Note: Weekly updates might be delayed due to delays in reporting. All data are provisional. Because these provisional counts are subject to change, including updates to data reported previously, adjustments can occur.

The<br />\nsurveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual,<br />\nestimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs,<br />\nalcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12<br />\nand older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime,<br />\nannual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:<br />\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,<br />\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including<br />\npain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey<br />\ncovered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for<br />\ntreatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical<br />\nManual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be<br />\napplied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both<br />\nsubstance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents were<br />\nalso asked about personal and family income sources and amounts,<br />\nhealth care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record,<br />\nproblems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.<br />\nQuestions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the<br />\n2004 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to<br />\n17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such<br />\nas neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,<br />\nsocial support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance<br />\nabuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes<br />\ntoward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures<br />\nfocused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained<br />\nwere questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of<br />\nusing drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal<br />\nbehavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most<br />\noften were introduced with the 1999 survey and retained through the<br />\n2003 survey. Background information includes gender, race, age,<br />\nethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran<br />\nstatus, and current household composition. In addition, in 2004 Adult and Adolescent Mental Health modules were added.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

This dataset contains archived community transmission and related data elements by county as originally displayed on the COVID Data Tracker. Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset has not been updated since October 20, 2022. An archived dataset containing weekly community transmission data by county as originally posted can also be found here: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>. \n\n<b>Related data</b>\nCDC has been providing the public with two versions of COVID-19 county-level community transmission level data: this dataset with the daily values as originally posted on the COVID Data Tracker, and an historical dataset with daily data as well as the updates and corrections from state and local health departments. Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf",

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \r\n\u00a7 Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers'.

Masks and respirators can reduce the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking these aerosols and droplets at the source. The ability of source control devices to block aerosols can be tested by expelling an aerosol through a headform wearing the device. These tests may be performed using constant airflows, which are simpler, or cyclic airflows, which are more realistic but require more complex methods. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the results found using constant vs. cyclic airflows.\n\nA source control measurement system was used to measure the efficacy of two cloth face masks, two medical masks with and without an elastic mask brace, a neck gaiter, and an N95 respirator as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols. With this system, the aerosol flows from the inside of the mask toward the outside; that is, the aerosol flows in the same direction as it would flow during an exhalation by a person wearing the source control device. The experiments were conducted under four airflow conditions: cyclic breathing at 15 liters/minute (L/min), cyclic breathing at 85 L/min, constant outward airflow at 15 L/min, and constant outward airflow at 85 L/min. Each experiment began by placing the source control device on the headform and performing a fit test. The measurement system collection chamber was then sealed, and the cyclic or constant airflow and the aerosol generation were initiated. The aerosol concentration in the collection chamber was measured using an optical particle spectrometer (OPS). The source control collection efficiency was determined by comparing the steady-state concentration of aerosol particles in the collection chamber when the source control device was worn with the concentration when no source control device was used.",

Both workers and people living in communities that are in close proximity to areas where gas and oil extraction and refinement occur have a higher incidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, reproductive and nervous system disorders,\n\nThe goal of these studies was to identify mechanisms underlying the development of cardiovascular disease after inhalation of crude oil vapors (COV). The oil used for this study was a surrogate of the crude oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (McKinney et al., 2021). We tested the hypothesis that changes in cardiovascular function after inhalation of COV are manifested as changes in the responsiveness of the heart and peripheral vascular system to vasoconstricting and vasodilating agonists.  Based on previous studies, we also predicted that inhalation of COV would affect the expression of biomarkers of cardiac and kidney function that are associated with blood pressure regulation and disease.",

The Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to analyze the data of selected metropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs) with 500 or more respondents. BRFSS data can be used to identify emerging health problems, establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public health policies and programs. BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available. Detailed information on sampling methodology and quality assurance can be found on the BRFSS website (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss).

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNotice: Due to data processing issues at CDC, data for the following jurisdictions may be incomplete for week 7: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New York City, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.\n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n\u00a7 Beginning in 2020, confirmed and probable cases are published separately.

States periodically conduct independent screening surveys of a probability sample designed to be representative of all third-grade students in the state. Some states also conduct surveys of students in other grades in school, or of Head Start program enrollees. This surveillance activity is voluntary. States submit their data to the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD), where the survey design and data collected are reviewed for quality and against the criteria for inclusion in NOHSS, before being sent to CDC for inclusion in Oral Health Data.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents. \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published \u2014 CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n\u2020 Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).",

TEDS consists of data reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs, which in turn report it to SAMHSA.<br />\nA sister data system, called the Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D), collects data on discharges from substance abuse treatment facilities. The first year of TEDS-A data is 1992, while the first year of TEDS-D is 2006.<br />\nTEDS variables that are required to be reported are called the \"Minimum Data Set (MDS)\", while those that are optional are called the \"Supplemental Data Set (SuDS)\".<br />\nVariables in the MDS include: information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment status, substance(s) abused, route of administration, frequency of use, age at first use, and whether methadone was prescribed in treatment. Supplemental variables include: diagnosis codes, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, source of income, health insurance, expected source of payment, pregnancy and veteran status, marital status, detailed not in labor force codes, detailed criminal justice referral codes, days waiting to enter treatment, and the number of arrests in the 30 days prior to admissions (starting in 2008).<br />\nSubstances abused include alcohol, cocaine and crack, marijuana and hashish, heroin, nonprescription methadone, other opiates and synthetics, PCP, other hallucinogens, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, other stimulants, benzodiazepines, other non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers, barbiturates, other non-barbiturate sedatives or hypnotics, inhalants, over-the-counter medications, and other substances.<br />\nCreated variables include total number of substances reported, intravenous drug use (IDU), and flags for any mention of specific substances.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>",

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics \u2014 new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to \u201ccounty_population\u201d. No change was made to the data points previous released.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> New column, \u201chealth_service_area_population\u201d, was added to the dataset to denote the total population in the designated Health Service Area based on 2019 Census estimate. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> FIPS codes for territories American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands were re-formatted to 5-digit numeric for records released on 3/3/2022 to be consistent with other records in the dataset.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Changes were made to the text fields in variables \u201ccounty\u201d, \u201cstate\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d so the formats are consistent across releases.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> The \u201c%\u201d sign was removed from the text field in column \u201ccovid_inpatient_bed_utilization\u201d. No change was made to the data. As indicated in the column description, values in this column represent the percentage of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (7-day average).  \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Data values for columns, \u201ccounty_population\u201d, \u201chealth_service_area_number\u201d, and \u201chealth_service_area\u201d were backfilled for records released on 2/24/2022. These columns were added since the week of 3/3/2022, thus the values were previously missing for records released the week prior.\n\n<b>April 7, 2022:</b> Updates made to data released on 3/24/2022 for Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands to correct a data mapping error.\n\n<b>April 21, 2022:</b> COVID-19 Community Level (CCL) data released for counties in Nebraska for the week of April 21, 2022 have 3 counties identified in the high category and 37 in the medium category.

In this Table, provisional cases* of notifiable diseases are displayed for United States, U.S. territories, and Non-U.S. residents.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases \u2014 The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable \u2014 The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable \u2014 This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated \u2014 There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum \u2014 Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n\u2020Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).\n\u00a7 Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\". NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.",

Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of death classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310) are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to rankable causes. Cause of death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1.

Many state statutes and regulations authorize and define the use of electronic health information (EHI).

Attorney researchers used WestlawNext to search for EHI-related statutes and regulations of the US states, US\r\nterritories, and the District of Columbia in effect as of January 2014.

Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (\u201csource\u201d) and a breathing simulator (\u201crecipient\u201d) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.",
